In a number of industries, such as the commercial real estate industry, they are in fact the only authoritative source of information. Companies attempting to organize commercial real estate inventories spend a significant amount of resources on manual data entry of this information. In this work, we propose a method for extracting structured data from free-form commercial real estate flyers in PDF and HTML formats. We modeled the problem as text categorization and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks and applied a supervised machine learning approach (Support Vector Machines). Our dataset consists of more than 2,200 commercial real estate fly-ers and associated manually entered structured data, which was used to automatically create training datasets. Traditionally, text categorization and NER approaches are based on textual information only. However, information in visually rich formats such as PDF and HTML is often conveyed by a combination of textual and visual features. Large fonts, visually salient colors, and positioning often indicate the most relevant pieces of information. We applied novel features based on visual characteristics in addition to traditional text features and show that performance improved significantly for both the text categorization and NER tasks."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Digital flyers are the preferred and sometimes only method of conveying offerings information in a","number of broker-based industries. Such industries typically lack a centralized database or an established source of information. Organizing such content typically involves manual data entry, an expensive and labour intensive effort. Further challenge is that available offerings constantly change and manually entered data often results in out-dated inventories.","In particular, the commercial real estate industry in the US (unlike residential real estate1) does not have a centralized database or an established source of information. A number of commercial real estate inventories collect commercial real estate data using information from flyers, contacting brokers, or visiting physical sites2. The data is manually entered in structured form. At the same time, inventories change on a daily basis. As a result, the collected information is typically sparse and often outdated. In fact, commercial real estate brokers often need to rely on networking and chance in preference to consulting third party listing databases.","While brokers do not often update third party in-ventory databases, they do create marketing materials (usually PDF flyers and/or HTML emails/web pages) that contain all relevant listing information. Virtually all commercial real estate offerings come with a publicly available marketing material that contains all relevant listing information. Figures 1 and 2 show two typical commercial real estate flyers.","1The US Multiple Listing Services (MLS), governed by the National Association of Realtors, represents the US residential real estate.","2LoopNet, subsidiary of CoStar Group Inc., is the most heavily trafficked online commercial real estate inventory.","283","Figure 1: An example of a commercial real estate flyer c⃝ Kudan Group Real Estate.","Our goal is to utilize this publicly available information and extract structured data that can be continuously updated for a reliable centralized database of offerings.","Commercial listing information is typically summarized in a structured form suitable for targeted property searches. The most important information consists of the various categories of the offering. For example, the transaction type (sale, lease, and/or investment), the property type (industrial, retail, of- fice, etc.), the location of the property (its full geocoded address), the size of the property, the contact information of the brokers representing the property, etc.","This information is typically present in text form within the flyer. However, flyers and similar marketing materials are essentially multi-media documents. In addition to text, information is also conveyed by attributes such as font size, color, positioning, and images. For example, the listing address of the flyer on Figure 1 can be easily identified by its prominent color, size, and positioning (2834 N. Southport Ave, upper left corner). While the address of the broker firm shown in the same flyer is considered non-essential information and lacks such visual prominence (156 North Jefferson St., upper right corner). In fact, it is very difficult and sometimes impossible to distinguish between the two address types when considering a text-only version of the flyer. Similarly, the transaction type (For Sale)","of the property on Figure 2 is prominently shown in a large font and distinctive color. To account for the multi-media nature of the dataset, we attempt to combine textual and visual features for the task of automatic extraction of structured information from free-form commercial real estate flyers.","The problem of extracting structured data from flyers was modeled as text categorization and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks as described in Section Problem Definition below. Typically, both text categorization and NER approaches are applied to genres with exclusively text-based content (newswires, scientific publications, blogs and other social media texts). As a result, the feature space of NER and text categorization involves purely textual features: word attributes and characteristics, their contexts and frequencies. However, textual information in visually rich formats, such as PDF and HTML, is interlaced with typographic and other visually salient characteristics. In this study, we propose several novel features that take visual characteristics into account and show that performance improves significantly on both the text categorization and NER tasks."]},{"title":"2 Problem Definition","paragraphs":["Given a commercial real estate flyer, our task is to extract structured information that can be used as in-put to a commercial real estate listing service. This information includes categories associated with the property (property type and transaction type) and a list of property attributes (address, space information, and broker information).","The task of identifying a list of categories was modeled as a text categorization task. The categories and associated types are summarized in Table 1. Both text categorization tasks (identifying the Transaction and Property Types) are multi-label classification tasks, i.e. multiple category labels can be assigned to each listing. For example, properties are often offered for both sale and lease and belong to both transaction types. Similarly, a retail building could offer an associated office unit and belongs to property types retail and office.","The task of identifying values of specific listing attributes was modeled as a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task.

The named entities represent a typical set of attributes collected by commercial real estate listing services. They are 1) one or more brokers representing the property and their contact information; 2) the full address of the property broken down into individual address fields; 3) one or more spaces including their sizes and types (e.g. sizes of available units in a shopping mall, the sizes of a warehouse building and associated office building, etc.).","Broker Name The contact information of all Broker Email listing brokers, including full name, Broker Phone email address, phone number.

It represents over 450 US locations, over 90 commercial real estate companies and over 800 commercial real estate brokers. The flyers were generated using different tools and formats and represent a wide variety of styles. Typically, the same broker can represent properties of various categories and transaction types. The text categorization was evaluated using the full dataset of 2,269 flyers with 5-fold cross validation. For the NER task, we used 60 percent of the flyers for training (a total of 1,361 flyers), and the remaining 40 percent for testing (a total of 908 flyers).","All flyers (PDF and HTML) were converted to a common format (HTML)4. The flyers were converted to text using an HTML parser and extracting DOM5 text elements while preserving some of the white space formatting. In some cases, text was presented inside embedded images within the flyer. Since the majority of flyers, however, were mostly in text format, OCR6 was not used and text within images was discarded. The median number of characters, tokens, and sentences for flyers are 2106, 424, and 72 respectively.","3.2 Training Data Transformation","In previous work, we have created a tool used to annotate HTML flyers and evaluated the NER task on a subset of 800 manually annotated flyers. However, the manual annotation proved a laborious task (the same listing attribute typically appears multiple times in the document) and resulted in moderate inter-annotator agreement.

Figure 2 shows an example of a real estate flyer and the corresponding manually entered listing data.","To generate a dataset for the text categorization tasks we assigned the list of manually entered labels for transaction and property types to each flyer. For example, the flyer from Figure 2 was assigned to transaction type sale and property type industrial.","To generate annotated data for the NER task, we had to convert the stand-alone listing information to annotated text in which each occurrence of the field values was marked with the corresponding entity type via string matching. The manually entered listing data, however, introduced some text variations and did not always match the text in the corresponding flyer. For example, the same street and intersection address could be expressed in a variety of ways (e.g. ‘Westpark Drive and Main Street’ vs ‘Westpark Dr & Main St’; ‘123 North Main Road’ vs ‘123 N Main’, etc.). Similarly, broker names, phones, and company names could have a variety of alternative representations (e.g. ‘Michael R. Smith’ vs ‘Mike Smith CCIM’; ‘Lee and Associates’ vs ‘Lee & Associates of IL LLC’; ‘773-777-0000 ext 102’ vs ‘773.777.0000x102’, etc.). Lastly, space size information was always entered in square feet, while at the same time it could be expressed as both square feet and acres (with various precision points) in the corresponding flyer (e.g. 53796 sf, 1.235 acres, 1.23 acres, etc.).","To account for the various ways in which an attribute value can be expressed in the text we hand-","7 c⃝ BrokerSavant Inc.","crafted a small set of rules and regular expressions that allowed us to find most of its alternative representations. In some cases, however, the listing value was not found in the corresponding flyer text. In the case of such a discrepancy, the flyer was simply discarded from the training set used for the corresponding named entity type. Such discrepancies could occur for several reasons. In some cases, the manually hand-crafted rules and regular expressions did not cover all possible variants in which the value could be expressed. On occasion, the text containing the attribute value was in image format (inside embedded images). We also noted a few instances of incorrectly entered manual data. As a result, only a portion of the training data (a total of 1,361 fly-ers) was used for the training of individual named entity types. We were able to automatically annotate 878 flyers used for training the address named entity recognizer (street or intersection, city, state, zip), 1145 flyers used for training the broker information named entity recognizer (broker name, phone, email, company) and 1242 flyers for training the space named entity recognizer (size and space type).","3.3 Data Pre-processing","As mentioned earlier, all flyers (PDF and HTML) were converted to a common format (HTML). An HTML parser was then used to create a text representation of the flyer. The text was tokenized and tokens were normalized (all tokens were converted to lower case and digits were converted to a common format).","As noted previously, data entry staff were able to quickly spot listing attributes of interest solely be-cause of their visual characteristics. To account for such visual characteristics we included typographic and other visual features associated with tokens or text chunks for both the text categorization and NER tasks. Typographic and visual features were based on the computed HTML style attributes for each DOM element containing text.","Computing the HTML style attributes is a complex task since they are typically defined by a combination of CSS8 files, in-lined HTML style attributes, and browser defaults. The complexities of style definition, inheritance, and overwriting are handled by","8Cascading Style Sheets.","286","browsers9. We used the Chrome browser to dynamically compute the style of each DOM element and output it as inline style attributes. To achieve this we programmatically inserted a javascript snippet that inlines the computed style and saves the new version of the HTML on the local file system utilizing the HTML5 saveAs interface10. We then normalized the style attribute values for font size, RGB color, and Y coordinate as described in the following sections.","3.4 Text Categorization","The text categorization task involves labeling all fly-ers with appropriate transaction types and property types as shown in Table 1. This is a multi-label classification task as in all cases a flyer can have more than one label (e.g. Transaction Type: sale, lease; Property Type: retail, office).","We applied a supervised Machine Learning approach to the task utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Vapnik, 2000) using the LibSVM library (Chang and Lin, 2011). SVM was a sensible choice as it has been shown to be one of the top performers on a number of text categorization tasks (Joachims, 1998; Yang and Liu, 1999; Sebastiani, 2002).","Category information such as the transaction type and property type are one of the key pieces of information in a flyer. However, they are not always explicitly mentioned in the flyer and in some cases the data entry person needs to read the full content of the flyer to infer the property type. For example, an industrial property might be inferred by a mention of a particular zoning category and description of load-ing docks; a retail property type might be inferred by mentions of retail neighbors (e.g. Staples, Bed Bath and Beyond, etc) and traffic counts; an investment property type can be inferred by description of NOI (net operating income) and Cap Rates (the ratio between the NOI and capital cost of a property), etc. At the same time, when present, terms indicating the transaction and property types typically appear prominently in large fonts. For example, the prop-","9We attempted to use an HTML renderer from the Cobra java toolkit http://lobobrowser.org/cobra.jsp to compute HTML style attributes. However, this renderer produced poor results on our dataset and failed to accurately compute the pixel location of text elements.","10https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js","erty type of the flyer shown on Figure 1 is prominently shown in large font (Restaurant indicates retail property type). Similarly, the transaction type of the flyer shown on Figure 2 is again prominently displayed in a large font (For Sale). The classifiers could then benefit from both the full text of the fly-ers, combined with some information of the visual prominence of individual words.","We used ‘bag-of-words’ representation (token unigrams) and modeled the task as a binary classifica-tion for each category label. As a term weighting scheme, we first used TF-IDF as one of the most common weighting schemes used for term categorization (Lan et al., 2005; Soucy and Mineau, 2005). This served as a performance baseline. To account for visually prominent characteristics of important document terms we also introduced a term weight that takes into account the relative font size of the term. As a measure of the relative font size, we used the percentile rank of the term font size, compared to all term font sizes in the document. For example, a weight of 0.9 is assigned to terms whose font size is greater than 90% of all tokens within the current document. The font size percentile was then used as a term weighting scheme (instead of TF-IDF). Table 3 summarizes the results of 5-fold cross validation using the full dataset of 2,269 flyers. We used a linear kernel model with the default parameters.","TF-IDF Font Size Pctl","Property type P 79.57 85.04 R 85.27 84.16 F 82.32 84.6","Transaction type P 87.56 89.64 R 92.87 94.60 F 90.14 92.05","Table 3: Results from applying SVM on the task of identifying flyer Property Types (retail, office, industrial, land, multi-family) and Transaction Types (sale, lease, investment).

The task was modeled as a BIO classification task, classifiers identify the Beginning, the Inside, and Outside of the text segments. We first used a traditional set of text-based features for the classification task. Table 4 lists the various text-based features used. In all cases, a sliding window including the 6 preceding and 6 following tokens was used as features.","Feature Name Description","Token A normalized string representation of the token.

We used a linear kernel model with the default parameters. The multi-class problem was converted to binary problems using the one-vs-others scheme.","As described earlier, we used a portion of the total training data (a total of 1,361 flyers) for the NER tasks. We were able to automatically annotate and use as training data 878 flyers used for address named entities, 1,145 flyers used for broker information named entities, and 1,242 flyers for space named entities. Results were evaluated against the manually entered data for the full test set of 908 flyers. We first used the trained classifiers to find named entities, including their boundaries and types. The predicted named entities were then used to generate listing data as follows. For attributes that have a single value per flyer, we used the predicted named entity of the corresponding type with the highest probability estimate12. Single value listing attributes are the fields of the listing address (street or intersection, city, state, zip). Flyers contain a single list-","12We used the LibSVM probability estimates for each predicted named entity.","288","ing, which in turn has a single address. In contrast, broker information and space information are multi-value attributes. A listing is typically represented by multiple brokers and can contain multiple spaces. To construct listing information in the case of multi-value attributes, we used all predicted named entities of the corresponding types. The predicted listing information was then compared to the gold standard of manually entered listing data.","The construction of listing data (for comparison with manually entered data) resulted in a strict performance measure. We consider an answer to be correct only if both the entity boundaries and entity type are accurately predicted. In addition, in the case of single value attributes, only the highest ranking named entity (based on estimated probabilities) was retained.","Results are shown in Table 6.

However, in both cases, improvements were some-what moderate (around 3% on average). Further improvement could be achieved by including features that account for additional visual characteristics, such as a measure of how eye-catching or strik-ing the relative font color differences are, the perceived contrast between foreground and background colors, etc.","In future work, we could also add to the overall system an image classification component. It has been noted that occasionally the only indicator of the property type of a flyer is present in embedded flyer images and not present in the flyer text. For example, a number of flyers display images of the inside and outside of restaurants, gas stations, shopping malls and thus specify the property type as retail without giving additional textual clues. Similarly, an image of a warehouse, a land parcel, or an areal photo of a shopping center explicitly identify the listing property type.","Lastly, it should be noted that an overall system performance baseline is one that measures the average performance of data entry staff in commercial real estate listing services. However, the terms and conditions of most listing services prohibit gather-ing and using data for such purposes.

We compared the values of manually entered listing fields against the associated flyer (considered to be the gold standard). The precision of property type, transaction type, space type, and space size was measured as 97%, 79%, 72%, and 73% respectively. While results are not conclusive, this preliminary evaluation suggests that machine learning could achieve performance on par with the performance of manual data entry."]},{"title":"5 Related Work","paragraphs":["A number of studies survey and compare term weighting schemes and feature selection methods for text categorization, for example (Salton and Buckley, 1988; Yang and Pedersen, 1997; Debole and Sebastiani, 2004; Soucy and Mineau, 2005; Lan et al., 2005; Lan et al., 2009).
