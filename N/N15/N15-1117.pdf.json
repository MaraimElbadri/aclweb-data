It is challenging because it requires the application of syntactic, semantic, and world knowledge (Ng, 2010).","For example, in the sentence Monsieur Poirot assured Hastings that he ought to have faith in him, the strings Monsieur Poirot and him refer to the same person, while Hastings and he refer to a different character.","There are a panoply of sophisticated coreference systems, both data-driven (Fernandes et al., 2012; Durrett and Klein, 2013; Durrett and Klein, 2014; Björkelund and Kuhn, 2014) and","rule-based (Pradhan et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2011). Recent CoNLL shared tasks provide the opportunity to make a fair comparison between these systems. However, because all of these shared tasks contain strictly newswire data,1 it is unclear how existing systems perform on more diverse data.","We argue in Section 2 that to truly solve coreference resolution, the research community needs high-quality datasets that contain many challenging cases such as nested coreferences and coreferences that can only be resolved using external knowledge. In contrast, newswire is deliberately written to contain few coreferences, and those coreferences should be easy for the reader to resolve. Thus, systems that are trained on such data commonly fail to detect coreferences in more expressive, non-newswire text.","Given newswire’s imperfect range of coreference examples, can we do better? In Section 3 we present a specialized dataset that specifically tests a human’s coreference resolution ability. This dataset comes from a community of trivia fans who also serve as enthusiastic annotators (Section 4). These data have denser coreference mentions than newswire text and present hitherto unexplored questions of what is coreferent and what is not. We also incorporate active learning into the annotation process. The result is a small but highly dense dataset of 400 documents with 9,471 mentions.","1We use “newswire” as an umbrella term that encompasses all forms of edited news-related data, including news articles, blogs, newsgroups, and transcripts of broadcast news.","1108","We demonstrate in Section 5 that our dataset is significantly different from newswire based on results from the effective, widely-used Berkeley system (Durrett and Klein, 2013). These results motivate us to develop a very simple end-to-end coreference resolution system consisting of a crf-based mention detector and a pairwise classifier. Our system outperforms the Berkeley system when both have been trained on our new dataset. This result motivates further exploration into complex coreference types absent in newswire data, which we discuss at length in Section 7."]},{"title":"2 Newswire’s Limitations for Coreference","paragraphs":["Newswire text is widely used as training data for coreference resolution systems. The standard datasets used in the muc (MUC-6, 1995; MUC-7, 1997), ace (Doddington et al., 2004), and CoNLL shared tasks (Pradhan et al., 2011) contain only such text. In this section we argue why this monoculture, despite its many past successes, offer diminishing results for advancing the coreference subfield.","First, newswire text has sparse references, and those that it has are mainly identity coreferences and appositives. In the CoNLL 2011 shared task (Pradhan et al., 2007) based on OntoNotes 4.0 (Hovy et al., 2006),2 there are 2.1 mentions per sentence; in the next section we present a dataset with 3.7 mentions per sentence.3 In newswire text, most nominal entities (not including pronouns) are singletons; in other words, they do not corefer to anything. OntoNotes 4.0 development data contains 25.4K singleton nominal entities (Durrett and Klein, 2013), compared to only 7.6K entities which corefer to something (anaphora). On the other hand, most pronominals are anaphoric, which makes them easy to resolve as pronouns are single token entities. While","2As our representative for “newswire” data, the English portion of the Ontonotes 4.0 contains professionallydelivered weblogs and newsgroups (15%), newswire (46%), broadcast news (15%), and broadcast conversation (15%).","3Neither of these figures include singleton mentions, as OntoNotes does not have gold tagged singletons. Our dataset has an even higher density when singletons are included.","it is easy to obtain a lot of newswire data, the amount of coreferent-heavy mention clusters in such text is not correspondingly high.","Second, coreference resolution in news text is trivial for humans because it rarely requires world knowledge or semantic understanding. Systems trained on news media data for a related problem—entity extraction—falter on non-journalistic texts (Poibeau and Kosseim, 2001). This discrepancy in performance can be at-tributed to the stylistic conventions of journalism. Journalists are instructed to limit the number of entities mentioned in a sentence, and there are strict rules for referring to individuals (Boyd et al., 2008). Furthermore, writers cannot assume that their readers are familiar with all participants in the story, which requires that each entity is explicitly introduced in the text (Goldstein and Press, 2004). These constraints make for easy reading and, as a side effect, easy coreference resolution. Unlike this simplified “journalistic” coreference, everyday coreference relies heavily on inferring the identities of people and entities in language, which requires substantial world knowledge.","While news media contains examples of coreference, the primary goal of a journalist is to convey information, not to challenge the reader’s coreference resolution faculty. Our goal is to evaluate coreference systems on data that taxes even human coreference."]},{"title":"3 Quiz Bowl: A Game of Human Coreference","paragraphs":["One example of such data comes from a game called quiz bowl. Quiz bowl is a trivia game where questions are structured as a series of sentences, all of which indirectly refer to the answer. Each question has multiple clusters of mutually-coreferent terms, and one of those clusters is coreferent with the answer. Figure 1 shows an example of a quiz bowl question where all answer coreferences have been marked.","A player’s job is to determine4 the entity ref-","4In actual competition, it is a race to see which team can identify the coreference faster, but we ignore that aspect here.","1109","NW Later, [they]1 all met with [President Jacques Chirac]2.

While quiz bowl has been viewed as a classification task (Iyyer et al., 2014), previous work has ignored the fundamental task of coreference.

Each document is a single quiz bowl question contain-ing an average of 5.2 sentences. While quiz bowl","1110","covers all areas of academic knowledge, we focus on questions about literature from Boyd-Graber et al. (2012), as annotation standards are more straightforward.","Our webapp (Figure 3) allows users to annotate a question by highlighting a phrase using their mouse and then pressing a number corresponding to the coreference group to which it belongs. Each group is highlighted with a single color in the interface. The webapp displays a single question at a time, and for some questions, users can compare their answers against gold annotations by the authors. We provide annotators the ability to see if their tags match the gold labels for a few documents as we need to provide a mechanism to help them learn the annotation guidelines as the annotators are crowdsourced volunteers. This improves inter-annotator agreement.","The webapp was advertised to quiz bowl players before a national tournament and attracted passionate, competent annotators preparing for the tournament. A leaderboard was implemented to encourage competitiveness, and prizes were given to the top five annotators.","Users are instructed to annotate all authors, characters, works, and the answer to the question (even if the answer is not one of the previously specified types of entities). We consider a coreference to be the maximal span that can be replaced by a pronoun.5 As an example, in the phrase this folk sermon by James Weldon Johnson, the entire phrase is marked, not just sermon or this folk sermon. Users are asked to consider appositives as separate coreferences to the same entity. Thus, The Japanese poet Basho has two phrases to be marked, The Japanese poet and Basho, which both refer to the same group.6 Users annotated prepositional phrases attached to a noun to capture entire noun phrases.","Titular mentions are mentions that refer to entities with similar names or the same name as","5We phrased the instruction in this way to allow our educated but linguistically unsavvy annotators to approximate a noun phrase.","6The datasets, full annotation guide, and code can be found at http://www.cs.umd.edu/~aguha/ qbcoreference.","Number of . . .

For our purposes, all titular mentions refer to the same coreference group. We also encountered a few mentions that refer to multiple groups; for example, in the sentence Romeo met Juliet at a fancy ball, and they get married the next day, the word they refers to both Romeo and Juliet. Currently, our webapp cannot handle such mentions.","To illustrate how popular the webapp proved to be among the quiz bowl community, we had 615 documents tagged by seventy-six users within a month. The top five annotators, who between them tagged 342 documents out of 651, have an agreement rate of 87% with a set of twenty author-annotated questions used to measure tagging accuracy.","We only consider documents that have either been tagged by four or more users with a predetermined degree of similarity and verified by one or more author (150 documents), or documents tagged by the authors in committee (250 documents). Thus, our gold dataset has 400 documents.","Both our quiz bowl dataset and the OntoNotes dataset are summarized in Table 2. If coreference resolution is done by pairwise classification, our dataset has a total of 116,125 possible mention pairs.

OntoNotes is 18.97 larger than our dataset in terms of tokens but only 13.4 times larger in terms of mentions.9 Next, we describe a technique that allows our webapp to choose which documents to display for annotation.","4.1 Active Learning","Active learning is a technique that alternates between training and annotation by selecting instances or documents that are maximally useful for a classifier (Settles, 2010). Because of the large sample space and amount of diversity present in the data, active learning helps us build our coreference dataset. To be more concrete, the original corpus contains over 7,000 literature questions, and we want to tag only the useful ones. Since it can take a quarter hour to tag a single document and we want at least four annotators to agree on every document that we include in the final dataset, annotating all 7,000 questions is infeasible.","We follow Miller et al. (2012), who use active learning for document-level coreference rather than at the mention level. Starting from a seed set of a hundred documents and an evaluation set of fifty documents10 we sample 250 more","9These numbers do not include singletons as","OntoNotes does not have them tagged, while ours does. 10These were documents tagged by the quiz bowl com-","documents from our set of 7,000 quiz bowl questions. We use the Berkeley coreference system (described in the next section) for the training phase. In Figure 4 we show the effectiveness of our iteration procedure. Unlike the result shown by Miller et al. (2012), we find that for our dataset voting sampling beats random sampling, which supports the findings of Laws et al. (2012).","Voting sampling works by dividing the seed set into multiple parts and using each to train a model. Then, from the rest of the dataset we select the document that has the most variance in results after predicting using all of the models. Once that document gets tagged, we add it to the seed set, retrain, and repeat the procedure. This process is impractical with instance-level active learning methods, as there are 116,125 mention pairs (instances) for just 400 documents. Even with document-level sampling, the procedure of training on all documents in the seed set and then testing every document in the sample space is a slow task. Batch learning can speed up this process at the cost of increased document redundancy; we choose not to use it because we want a diverse collection of annotated documents.

Training and evaluating the Berkeley system on quiz bowl data also results in poor performance. 11 This result motivates us to build an end-to-end coreference resolution system that includes a data-driven mention detector (as opposed to Berkeley’s rule-based one) and a simple pairwise classifier. Using our mentions and only six feature types, we are able to outperform the Berkeley system on our data. Finally, we explore the linguistic phenomena that make quiz bowl coreference so hard and draw insights from our analysis that may help to guide the next generation of coreference systems.","11We use default options, including hyperparameters tuned on OntoNotes","5.1 Evaluating the Berkeley System on Quiz Bowl Data","We use two publicly-available pretrained models supplied with the Berkeley coreference system, Surface and Final, which are trained on the entire OntoNotes dataset. The difference between the two models is that Final includes semantic features. We report results with both models to see if the extra semantic features in Final are expressive enough to capture quiz bowl’s inherently difficult coreferences. We also train the Berkeley system on quiz bowl data and compare the performance of these models to the pretrained newswire ones in Table 3. Our results are obtained by running a five-fold cross-validation on our dataset. The results show that newswire is a poor source of data for learning how to resolve quiz bowl coreferences and prompted us to see how well a pairwise classifier does in comparison. To build an end-to-end coreference system using this classifier, we first need to know which parts of the text are “mentions”, or spans of a text that refer to real world entities. In the next section we talk about our mention detection system.","5.2 A Simple Mention Detector","Detecting mentions is done differently by different coreference systems. The Berkeley system does rule-based mention detection to detect every NP span, every pronoun, and every named entity, which leads to many spurious mentions. This process is based on an earlier work of Kummerfeld et al. (2011), which assumes that every maximal projection of a noun or a pronoun is a mention and uses rules to weed out spurious mentions. In-stead of using such a rule-based mention detector, our system detects mentions via sequence labeling, as detecting mentions is essentially a problem of detecting start and stop points in spans of text. We solve this sequence tagging problem using the mallet (McCallum, 2002) implementa-tion of conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001). Since our data contain nested mentions, the sequence labels are bio markers (Ratinov and Roth, 2009). The features we use, which are similar to those used in Kummerfeld et al. (2011), are:","1113","muc","System Train P R F1","Surface OntoN 47.22 27.97 35.13 Final OntoN 50.79 30.77 38.32","Surface QB 60.44 31.31 41.2 Final QB 60.21 33.41 42.35","Table 3: The top half of the table represents Berkeley models trained on OntoNotes 4.0 data, while the bottom half shows models trained on quiz bowl data.

When comparing our detected mentions to gold standard mentions on the quiz bowl dataset using exact matches, we obtain 76.1% precision, 69.6% recall, and 72.7% F1 measure. Now that we have high-quality mentions, we can feed each pair of mentions into a pairwise mention classifier.","5.3 A Simple Coref Classifier","We follow previous pairwise coreference systems (Ng and Cardie, 2002; Uryupina, 2006; Versley et al., 2008) in extracting a set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features from two mentions to determine whether they are coreferent. For example, if Sylvia Plath, he, and she are all of the mentions that occur in a document, our classifier gives predictions for the pairs he—Sylvia Plath, she—Sylvia Plath, and he—she.","Given two mentions in a document, m1 and m2, we generate the following features and feed them to a logistic regression classifier:"," binary indicators for all tokens contained in","12These features were obtained using the Stanford dependency parser (De Marneffe et al., 2006).","m1 and m2 concatenated with their parts-of-speech"," same as above except for an n-word window before and after m1 and m2"," how many tokens separate m1 and m2"," how many sentences separate m1 and m2"," the cosine similarity of word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) vector representations of m1 and m2; we obtain these vectors by averag-ing the word embeddings for all words in each mention.

Since they have been trained on huge corpora, the word embeddings allow us to infuse world knowledge into our model; for instance, the vector for Russian is more similar to Dostoevsky than Hemingway.","Figure 5 shows that our logistic regression model (lr) outperforms the Berkeley system on numerous metrics when trained and evaluated on the quiz bowl dataset. We use precision, recall, and F1, metrics applied to muc, bcub, and ceafe measures used for comparing coreference systems.13 We find that our lr model outperforms Berkeley by a wide margin when both are trained on the mentions found by our mention detector (crf). For four metrics, the crf mentions actually improve over training on the gold mentions.","Why does the lr model outperform Berkeley","13The muc (Vilain et al., 1995) score is the minimum number of links between mentions to be inserted or deleted when mapping the output to a gold standard key set. bcub (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) computes the precision and recall for all mentions separately and then combines them to get the final precision and recall of the output. ceafe (Luo, 2005) is an improvement on bcub and does not use entities multiple times to compute scores.","1114","Berkeley Mentions CRF Mentions Gold Mentions","0 25 50 75","0 25 50 75","0 25 50 75","BCUB","CEAFE","MUC","F1 P R F1 P R F1 P R","Score","Coreference LR QB Final (Berkeley trained on QB)","Figure 5: All models are trained and evaluated on quiz bowl data via five fold cross validation on F1, precision, and recall.

Our model outperforms the Berkeley model on every metric when using our detected crf mentions. When given gold mentions, lr outperforms Berkeley QB Final in five of nine metrics.","when both are trained on our quiz bowl dataset? We hypothesize that some of Berkeley’s features, while helpful for sparse OntoNotes coreferences, do not offer the same utility in the denser quiz bowl domain. Compared to newswire text, our dataset contains a much larger percentage of complex coreference types that require world knowledge to resolve. Since the Berkeley system lacks semantic features, it is unlikely to correctly resolve these instances, whereas the pretrained word embedding features give our lr model a better chance of handling them correctly. An-other difference between the two models is that the Berkeley system ranks mentions as opposed to doing pairwise classification like our lr model, and the mention ranking features may be optimized for newswire text.","5.4 Why Quiz Bowl Coreference is Challenging","While models trained on newswire falter on these data, is this simply a domain adaptation issue or something deeper? In the rest of this section, we examine specific examples to understand why quiz bowl coreference is so difficult. We begin with examples that Final gets wrong.","This writer depicted a group of samu-","rai’s battle against an imperial. For ten points, name this Japanese writer of A Personal Matter and The Silent Cry.","While Final identifies most of pronouns associated with Kenzaburo Oe (the answer), it cannot recognize that the theme of the entire paragraph is building to the final reference, “this Japanese writer”, despite the many Japanese-related ideas in the text of the question (e.g., Samurai and emperor). Final also cannot reason effectively about coreferences that are tied together by similar modifiers as in the below example:","That title character plots to secure a “beautiful death” for Lovberg by burn-ing his manuscript and giving him a pistol. For 10 points, name this play in which the titular wife of George Tesman commits suicide.","While a reader can connect “titular” and “title” to the same character, Hedda Gabler, the Berkeley system fails to make this inference. These data are a challenge for all systems, as they require extensive world knowledge. For example, in the following sentence, a model must know that the story referenced in the first sentence is about a dragon and that dragons can fly.","1115","The protagonist of one of this man’s works erects a sign claiming that that story’s title figure will fly to heaven from a pond. Identify this author of Dragon: the Old Potter’s Tale","Humans solve cases like these using a vast amount of external knowledge, but existing models lack information about worlds (both real and imaginary) and thus cannot confidently mark these coreferences. We discuss coreference work that incorporates external resources such as Wikipedia in the next section; our aim is to provide a dataset that benefits more from this type of information than newswire does."]},{"title":"6 Related Work","paragraphs":["We describe relevant data-driven coreference research in this section, all of which train and evaluate on only newswire text. Despite efforts to build better rule-based (Luo et al., 2004) or hybrid statistical systems (Haghighi and Klein, 2010), data-driven systems currently dominate the field. The 2012 CoNLL shared task led to improved data-driven systems for coreference resolution that finally outperformed both the Stanford system (Lee et al., 2011) and the ims system (Björkelund and Farkas, 2012), the latter of which was the best available publicly-available English coreference system at the time. The recently-released Berkeley coreference system (Durrett and Klein, 2013) is especially strik-ing: it performs well with only a sparse set of carefully-chosen features. Semantic knowledge sources—especially WordNet (Miller, 1995) and Wikipedia—have been used in coreference engines (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006). A system by Ratinov and Roth (2012) demonstrates good performance by using Wikipedia knowledge to strengthen a multi-pass rule based system. In a more recent work, Durrett and Klein (2014) outperform previous systems by building a joint model that matches mentions to Wikipedia entities while doing named entity resolution and coreference resolution simultaneously. We take a different approach by approximating semantic and world knowledge through our word embedding features. Our simple classifier yields a bi-","nary decision for each mention pair, a method that had been very popular before the last five years (Soon et al., 2001; Bengtson and Roth, 2008; Stoyanov et al., 2010). Recently, better results have been obtained with mention-ranking systems (Luo et al., 2004; Haghighi and Klein, 2010; Durrett and Klein, 2013; Björkelund and Kuhn, 2014). However, on quiz bowl data, our experiments show that binary classifiers can outperform mention-ranking approaches."]},{"title":"7 Embracing Harder Coreference","paragraphs":["This paper introduces a new, naturally-occuring coreference dataset that is easy to annotate but difficult for computers to solve. We show that active learning allows us to create a dataset that is rich in different types of coreference. We develop an end-to-end coreference system using very simple mention detection and pairwise classification models that outperforms traditional systems on our dataset. The next challenge is to incorporate the necessary world knowledge to solve these harder coreference problems. Systems should be able to distinguish who is likely to marry whom, identify the titles of books from roundabout descriptions, and intuit family relationships from raw text. These are coreference challenges not found in newswire but that do exist in the real world. Unlike other ai-complete problems like machine translation, coreference in challenging datasets is easy to both annotate and evaluate.
