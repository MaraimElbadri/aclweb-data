Computational Linguistics has grown into one of the most exciting and diverse research communities, with an ever increasing number of researchers, many big and small companies, and a vibrant community of learners eager to get prepared to take on some of the fun and exciting challenges in the field. This year’s NAACL-HLT conference is a testimony to the vibrancy and vitality of this community.","Some of the highlights of this year’s program include two excellent invited speakers – Lillian Lee from Cornell and Fei-fei Li from Stanford – who will talk about the exciting research going on at the intersection of our field with social sciences and computer vision; many interesting paper presentations on cutting-edge research in computational linguistics, culminating with three best paper awards that will be presented in a plenary session during the last day of the conference; several excellent student-authored papers and dissertation proposals as part of the student research workshop; many exciting demos showing the latest in terms of developed systems available in our field; six tutorials on some of the most up-and-coming research topics in computational linguistics; several workshops on diverse topics ranging from multiword expressions and metaphors to clinical psychology and educational applications, including thirteen (!) one-day workshops and SEMEVAL as a two-day workshop; the fourth joint conference on lexical and computational semantics *SEM as a collocated conference; and, last but not least: a country line dance lesson!","As with any event of this scale, it would have not been possible without the hard work of a wonderful group of people. I would like to thank Priscilla Rasmussen for the zillions of bits and pieces that she has been doing on an everyday basis, to make sure that every single logistical detail of the forthcoming NAACL-HLT was ironed out. It is no overstatement to say that the success (and fun!) of this year’s conference is in large part due to Priscilla.","I am also grateful to Hal Daumé III for getting us started on this “NAACL-HLT 2015\" journey, and being always willing to help with advice and information from his experience from previous years. Lucy Vanderwende and Daniel Marcu have also graciously agreed to \"pass the baton\" conversations that were very helpful and informative.","I was extremely fortunate to have the chance to work with the best committee ever: Joyce Chai and Anoop Sarkar (program chairs); Cornelia Caragea and Bing Liu (workshop co-chairs); Yang Liu and Thamar Solorio (tutorial co-chairs); Shibamouli Lahiri, Karen Mazidi and Alisa Zhila (student co-chairs) and Diana Inkpen and Smaranda Muresan (faculty advisors) for the student research workshop; Matt Gerber, Catherine Havasi, and Finley Lacatusu (demo co-chairs); Annie Louise (student volunteer coordinator); Kevin Cohen (local sponsorship chair); Saif Mohammad (publicity chair); Matt Post and Adam Lopez (publication co-chairs); Peter Ljunglöf (website chair); Aurelia Bunescu (handbook cover designer); Graeme Hirst and Joel Tetreault (treasurers); Asli Celikyilmaz and Julia Hockenmaier (sponsorship co-chairs).","I am also grateful to our sponsors for their generous contributions, which made the conference possible: A9, Baobab, Bloomberg, Digital Roots, Goldman Sachs, Google, IBM, Information Sciences Institute, National Science Foundation, Nuance, SDL, University of Washington Computational Linguistics, Yahoo Labs.","iv","Finally, my gratitude goes to everyone else who contributed to the success of the conference: area chairs, workshop organizers, tutorial presenters, student mentors, and reviewers. And of course my deepest thanks to you, the attendees: you are the life and spirit of this entire conference.","Here is to an enjoyable NAACL-HLT 2015, and many more exciting conferences to come!","Rada Mihalcea, University of Michigan NAACL 2015 General Chair","v"]},{"title":"Message from the Program Chairs","paragraphs":["Welcome to the 2015 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics – Human Language Technologies or NAACL HLT 2015 for short.","This year, we received the largest number of submissions in the history of NAACL: a total of 714 submissions with 402 long paper submissions and 312 short papers submissions. From these, 117 long papers (62 oral presentations and 55 poster presentations) and 69 short papers (24 oral presentations and 45 poster presentations) were accepted to appear at the conference.","The submissions to NAACL HLT 2015 were assigned to 18 technical areas including a new topic area called Language and Vision. This track was introduced with an intent to broaden research on natural language processing that is situated in a rich visual and perceptual context. We received 16 submissions for this area and seven of them will be presented at the conference.","For NAACL HLT 2015 we initiated a meta review process, where each paper received an analysis of the merits of the paper from the area chair’s perspective that was based on the reviewer comments, the reviewer discussion and the author rebuttal. We found the meta reviews very helpful in consolidating the reviews and providing justifications for final decisions. As this was an experiment this year, the meta reviews were not sent to the authors.","Based on comments from reviewers, nominations from area chairs, and rankings from the best paper committee, three papers were selected to receive the best paper awards at the conference.","Continuing the tradition, NAACL HLT 2015 will feature 19 papers which were accepted for publication in the Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL). The TACL papers were split into 10 oral presentations and 9 poster presentatons.","We are very pleased to have two exciting keynote talks: one by Professor Lillian Lee (Cornell University) and the other by Professor Fei-fei Li (Stanford University).","There are many people to thank for who have worked diligently to make NAACL HLT 2015 possible. Thanks to the 32 area chairs for their hard work on recruiting reviewers, managing reviews, leading discussions, and making recommendations. All the area chairs are listed in the Program Committee section of the Front Matter. Thanks to Chris Callison-Burch, David Mimno, Sameer Pradhan, and Philip Resnik for stepping in to serve as area co-chairs at the last minute when we were faced with an unexpectedly large number of submissions in some tracks.","Following what was done in the last NAACL conference, we used the paper assignment tool developed by Mark Dredze to assign papers to reviewers. Thanks to Mark Dredze and Jiang Guo for their hard work on assigning papers to reviewers based on their preferences. We had to especially rely on this tool this year because the distribution of submissions across areas was very different from past trends.","This program certainly would not be possible without the help of the 460 reviewers. Their names are listed in the Program Committee section. In particular, 116 reviewers from this list were recognized by the area chairs as best reviewers who have turned in exceptionally well-written and constructive reviews and who have actively engaged in the post-rebuttal discussions. The names of the best reviewers are","vi","marked with * in the list of reviewers.","We are also indebted to the best paper award committee which consists of Claire Cardie, Daniel Gildea, Daniel Marcu, and Fernando Pereira. Their time and effort in recommending the best paper awards is much appreciated.","We also would like to thank Hal Daumé III, Kristina Toutanova, and Lucy Vanderwende for generously sharing their experience in organizing prior NAACL/ACL conferences and for their advice. We are grateful for the guidance and the support of the NAACL president Hal Daumé III, and the NAACL board. We also would like to thank the publication co-chairs Matt Post and Adam Lopez for putting together the proceedings and the conference handbook; and Paolo Gai and Rich Gerber from Softconf for always being responsive to our requests.","We would like to thank the ACL Business Manager Priscilla Rasmussen. She was our go to person who knew all details of the conference in and out. We are very grateful for her help.","Finally, this conference could not have happened without the efforts of the general chair, Rada Mihalcea. She made sure the various sections of NAACL organization worked well together. Her monthly newsletters informed all the organizers about what was being done by everyone else. We are very thankful for her leadership in the organization of NAACL HLT 2015.","We hope you will enjoy NAACL HLT 2015!","NAACL HLT 2015 Program Co-Chairs Joyce Chai, Michigan State University Anoop Sarkar, Simon Fraser University","vii"]},{"title":"Organizing Committee","paragraphs":["General Chair Rada Mihalcea, University of Michigan, USA","Local Arrangements Chair Priscilla Rasmussen, ACL Business Manager","Program Committee Co-chairs Joyce Chai, Michigan State University, USA Anoop Sarkar, Simon Fraser University, Canada","Workshop Co-chairs Cornelia Caragea, University of North Texas, USA Bing Liu, University of Illinois at Chicago, USA","Tutorial Co-chairs Yang Liu, University of Texas at Dallas, USA Thamar Solorio, University of Alabama at Birmingham, USA","Student Research Workshop Co-chairs","Student Co-chairs Shibamouli Lahiri, University of Michigan, USA Karen Mazidi, University of North Texas, USA Alisa Zhila, Instituto Politécnico Nacional (National Polytechnic Institute), Mexico","Faculty Advisors Diana Inkpen, University of Ottawa, Canada Smaranda Muresan, Columbia University, USA","Demo Co-chairs Matt Gerber, University of Virginia, USA Catherine Havasi, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA Finley Lacatusu, Language Computer Corporation, USA","Student Volunteer Coordinator Annie Louis, University of Edinburgh, UK","Reviewing Coordinators Mark Dredze, Johns Hopkins University Jiang Guo, Harbin Institute of Technology","Local Sponsorship Chair Kevin B.

But as a field, I think natural language processing and computational linguistics have much to contribute to the conversation, and I hope to encourage the community to further address these issues.","This talk will focus on the effect of phrasing, emphasizing aspects that go beyond just the selection of one particular word over another. The issues we’ll consider include: Does the way in which something is worded in and of itself have an effect on whether it is remembered or attracts attention, beyond its content or context? Can we characterize how different sides in a debate frame their arguments, in a way that goes beyond specific lexical choice (e.g., \"pro-choice\" vs. \"pro-life\")? The settings we’ll explore range from movie quotes that achieve cultural prominence; to posts on Facebook, Wikipedia, Twitter, and the arXiv; to framing in public discourse on the inclusion of genetically-modified organisms in food.","Joint work with Lars Backstrom, Justin Cheng, Eunsol Choi, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, Jon Kleinberg, Bo Pang, Jennifer Spindel, and Chenhao Tan."]},{"title":"Biography","paragraphs":["Lillian Lee is a professor of computer science and of information science at Cornell University, and the co-Editor-in-Chief, together with Michael Collins, of Transactions of the ACL.

Such technology will have a fundamental impact in almost every aspect of our daily life and the society as a whole, ranging from e-commerce, image search and indexing, assistive technology, autonomous driving, digital health and medicine, surveillance, national security, robotics and beyond. In this talk, I will give an overview of what computer vision technology is about and its brief history. I will then discuss some of the recent work from my lab towards large scale object recognition and visual scene story telling.
