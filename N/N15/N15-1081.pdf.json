Rutherford Department of Computer Science Brandeis University Waltham, MA 02453, USA tet@brandeis.edu Nianwen Xue Department of Computer Science Brandeis University Waltham, MA 02453, USA xuen@brandeis.edu Abstract","paragraphs":["Discourse relation classification is an important component for automatic discourse parsing and natural language understanding. The performance bottleneck of a discourse parser comes from implicit discourse relations, whose discourse connectives are not overtly present. Explicit discourse connectives can potentially be exploited to collect more training data to collect more data and boost the performance. However, using them indiscriminately has been shown to hurt the performance because not all discourse connectives can be dropped arbitrarily. Based on this insight, we investigate the interaction between discourse connectives and the discourse relations and propose the criteria for selecting the discourse connectives that can be dropped independently of the context without chang-ing the interpretation of the discourse. Extra training data collected only by the freely omissible connectives improve the performance of the system without additional features."]},{"title":"1 Introduction The analysis of discourse-level structure has received increasing attention from the field in recent years (Feng and Hirst, 2012; Patterson and Kehler, 2013; Li et al., 2014). Discourse-level analysis is typically concerned with relations between clauses and sentences, linguistic units that go beyond sentence boundaries. There are a few conceptions of the discourse structure representation of a text such as a tree (Mann and Thompson, 1988), or a graph (Wolf et al., 2005). In the work we describe here, we adopt the view of the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008), which views a text as a series of local discourse relations, each of which consists of a discourse connective as a predicate tak-ing two arguments. Syntactically, these two arguments are typically realized as clauses or sentences. The discourse connective (underlined) can either be explicit, as in (1), or implicit, as in (2):","paragraphs":["(1) [The city’s Campaign Finance Board has refused to pay Mr Dinkins $95,142 in matching funds]Arg1 because [his campaign records are incomplete]Arg2.","(2) [So much of the stuff poured into its Austin, Texas, offices that its mail rooms there simply stopped delivering it]Arg1. Implicit=so [Now, thousands of mailers, catalogs and sales pitches go straight into the trash]Arg2.","Determining the sense of an explicit discourse relation such as (1) is straightforward since “because” is a strong indicator that the relation between the two arguments is CONTINGENCY.CAUSE. This task effectively amounts to disambiguating the sense of discourse connective, which can be done with high accuracy (Pitler et al., 2008)."]},{"title":"However, in the absence of an explicit discourse connective, inferring the sense of a discourse relation has proved to a very challenging task (Park and Cardie, 2012; Rutherford and Xue, 2014). The sense is no longer localized on one or two discourse connectives and must now be inferred solely based on its two textual arguments. Given the limited amount of annotated data in comparison to the number of features needed, the process of building a classi- fier is plagued by the data sparsity problem (Li and Nenkova, 2014). As a result, the classification accuracy of implicit discourse relations remains much 799 lower than that of explicit discourse relations (Pitler et al., 2008). One potential method for reducing the data sparsity problem is through a distantly supervised learning paradigm, which is the direction we take in this work. Distant supervision approaches make use of prior knowledge or heuristics to cheaply obtain weakly labeled data, which potentially contain a small number of false labels. Weakly labeled data can be collected from unannotated data and incorporated in the model training process to supplement manually labeled data. For our task, we can collect instances of explicit discourse relations from unannotated data by some simple heuristics. After dropping the discourse connectives, we should be able to treat them as additional implicit discourse relations. The approach assumes that when the discourse connective is omitted, the discourse relation remains the same, which is a popular assumption in discourse analysis (Fraser, 2006; Schourup, 1999). This assumption turns out to be too strong in many cases as illustrated in (3):","paragraphs":["(3) [I want to go home for the holiday]Arg1. Nonetheless, [I will book a flight to Hawaii]Arg2.","If “Nonetheless” is dropped in (3), one can no longer infer the COMPARISON relation. Instead, one would naturally infer a CONTINGENCY relation. Dropping the connective and adding the relation as a training sample adds noise to the training set and can only hurt the performance. In addition, certain types of explicit discourse relations have no corresponding implicit discourse relations. For example, discourse relations of the type CONTINGENY.CONDITION are almost always expressed with an explicit discourse connective and do not exist in implicit relations. We believe this also explains the lack of success in previous attempts to boost the performance of implicit discourse relation detection with this approach. (Biran and McKeown, 2013; Pitler et al., 2009). This suggests that in order for this approach to work, we need to identify instances of explicit discourse relations that closely match the characteristics of implicit discourse relations."]},{"title":"In this paper, we propose two criteria for selecting such explicit discourse relation instances: omission rate and context differential. Our selection criteria first classify discourse connectives by their distributional properties and suggest that not all discourse connectives are truly optional and not all implicit and explicit discourse relations are equivalent, contrary to commonly held beliefs in previous studies of discourse connectives. We show that only the freely omissible discourse connectives gather additional training instances that lead to significant performance gain against a strong baseline. Our approach improves the performance of implicit discourse relations without additional feature engineer-ing in many settings and opens doors to more sophisticated models that require more training data. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe the discourse connective selection criteria. In Section 3, we present our discourse connective classification method and experimental results that demonstrate its impact on inferring implicit discourse relations. We discuss related work and conclude our findings in Section 4 and 5 respectively. 2 Discourse Connective Classification and Discourse Relation Extraction 2.1 Datasets used for selection We use two datasets for the purposes of extracting and selecting weakly labeled explicit discourse relation instances: the Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0 (Prasad et al., 2008) and the English Gigaword corpus version 3 (Graff et al., 2007).","paragraphs":["The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) is the largest manually annotated corpus of discourse relations on top of one million word tokens from the Wall Street Journal (Prasad et al., 2008; Prasad et al., 2007). Each discourse relation in the PDTB is annotated with a semantic sense in the PDTB sense hierarchy, which has three levels: CLASS, TYPE and SUBTYPE. In this work, we are primarily concerned with the four top-level CLASS senses: EXPANSION, COMPARISON, CONTINGENCY, and TEMPORAL. The distribution of top-level senses of implicit discourse relations is shown in Table 2. The spans of text that participate in the discourse relation are also explicitly annotated. These are called ARG1 or ARG2, depending on its relationship with the discourse connective."]},{"title":"The PDTB is our corpus of choice for its lexical 800 groundedness. The existence of a discourse relation must be linked or grounded to a discourse connective. More importantly, this applies to not only explicit discourse connectives that occur naturally as part of the text but also to implicit discourse relations where a discourse connective is added by an-notators during the annotation process. This is crucial to the work reported here in that it allows us to compare the distribution of the same connective in explicit and implicit discourse relations. In the next subsection, we will explain in detail how we compute the comparison measures and apply them to the selection of explicit discourse connectives that can be used for collecting good weakly labeled data. We use the Gigaword corpus, a large unannotated newswire corpus, to extract and select instances of explicit discourse discourse relations to supplement the manually annotated instances from the PDTB. The Gigaword corpus is used for its large size of 2.9 billion words and its similarity to the Wall Street Journal data from the PDTB. The source of the corpus is drawn from six distinct international sources of English newswire dating from 1994 - 2006. We use this corpus to extract weakly labeled data for the experiment. 2.2 Discourse relation extraction pattern We extract instances of explicit discourse relations from the Gigaword Corpus that have the same patterns as the implicit discourse relations in the PDTB, using simple regular expressions. We first sentence-segment the Gigaword Corpus using the NLTK sentence segmenter (Bird, 2006). We then write a set of rules to prevent some common erroneous cases such as because vs because of from being included. If a discourse connective is a subordinating conjunction, then we use the following pattern:","paragraphs":["(Clause 1) (connective) (clause 2).","Clause 1 and capitalized clause 2 are then used as Arg1","and Arg2 respectively.","If a discourse connective is a coordinating conjunction","or discourse adverbial, we use the following pattern:","(Sentence 1). (Connective),(clause 2).","Sentence 1 and Clause 2 with the first word capitalized are used as Arg1 and Arg2 respectively.","Although there are obviously many other syntactic patterns associated with explicit discourse connectives, we use these two patterns because these are the only patterns","that are also observed in the implicit discourse relations. We want to select instances of explicit discourse relations that match the argument patterns of implicit discourse relations as much as possible. As restrictive as this may seem, these two patterns along with the set of rules allow us to extract more than 200,000 relation instances from the Gigaword corpus, so the coverage is not an issue."]},{"title":"2.3 Discourse connective selection and","paragraphs":["classification criteria We hypothesize that connectives that are omitted often and in a way that is insensitive to the semantic context are our ideal candidates for extracting good weakly labeled data. We call this type of connectives freely omissible discourse connectives. To search for this class of connectives, we need to characterize connectives by the rate at which they are omitted and by the similarity between their context, in this case their arguments, in explicit and implicit discourse relations. This is possible because implicit discourse connectives are inserted during annotation in the PDTB. For each discourse connective, we can compute omission rate and context differential from annotated explicit and implicit discourse relation instances in the PDTB and use those measures to classify and select discourse connectives."]},{"title":"2.3.1 Omission rate (OR)","paragraphs":["We use omission rates (OR) to measure the level of optionality of a discourse connective.

If the omission of a discourse connective leads to a different interpretation of the discourse relation, this means that the explicit and implicit discourse relations bound by this discourse connective are not equivalent, and the explicit discourse relation instance cannot be used to help infer the sense of the implicit discourse relation. Conversely, if the contexts for the discourse connective in explicit and implicit discourse relations do not significantly differ, then the explicit discourse relation instance can be used as weakly labeled data.","To capture this intuition, we must quantify the context differential of explicit and implicit discourse relations for each discourse connective. We represent the"]},{"title":"801","paragraphs":["semantic context of a discourse connective through a unigram distribution over words in its two arguments, with Arg1 and Arg2 combined. We use Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) as a metric for measuring the difference between the contexts of a discourse connective in implicit and explicit discourse relations. Computing a context differential of the discourse connective therefore involves fitting a unigram distribution from all implicit discourse relations bound by that discourse connective and fitting another from all explicit discourse relations bound by the same discourse connective. We choose this method because it has been shown to be exceptionally effective in capturing similarities of discourse connectives (Hutchinson, 2005) and statistical language analysis in general (Lee, 2001; Ljubesic et al., 2008).","The Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) metric for difference between Po, the semantic environments (unigram distribution of words in Arg1 and Arg2 combined) in implicit discourse relations, and Pr, the semantic environments in explicit discourse relations, is defined as:","JSD(Po||Pr) =","1 2","D(Po||M ) +","1 2","D(Pr||M )","where M = 1","2 (Po + Pr) is a mixture of the two distributions and D(.||.) is Kullback-Leibler divergence function for discrete probability distributions:","D(P ||Q) =","∑","i","ln(","P (i) Q(i)",")P (i)","2.4 Discourse Connective Classification Using the two metrics, we can classify discourse connectives into the following classes:","1.

We also believe this setup is more natural in realistic settings. Each classification instance consists of the two arguments of an implicit discourse relation, typically adjacent pairs of sentences in a text. The distribution of the sense labels is shown in Table 2. We follow the data split used in previous work for a consistent comparison (Rutherford and Xue, 2014). The PDTB corpus is split into a training set, development set, and test set. Sections 2 to 20 are used to train classifiers. Sections 0 and 1 are used for developing feature sets and tuning models. Section 21 and 22 are used for testing the systems.","To evaluate our method for selecting explicit discourse relation instances, we extract weakly labeled discourse relations from the Gigaword corpus for each class of discourse connective such that the discourse connectives are equally represented within the class.

While providing a useful insight into how discourse connectives fit into utterances, the syntactic classification does not seem suitable for selecting useful discourse connectives for our purposes of distant supervision for our task."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion and Future Directions","paragraphs":["We propose two selection criteria for discourse connectives that can be used to gather weakly labeled data for implicit discourse relation classifiers and improve the performance of the state-of-the-art system without further feature engineering. As part of this goal, we classify dis-"]},{"title":"806","paragraphs":["course connectives based on their distributional semantic properties and found that certain classes of discourse connectives cannot be omitted in every context, which plague the weakly labeled data used in previous studies. Our discourse connective classification allows for the better selection of data points for distant supervision.","More importantly, this work presents a new direction in distantly supervised learning paradigm for implicit discourse relation classification. This virtual dramatic increase in the training set size allows for more feature engineering and more sophisticated models. Implicit discourse relation classification is now no longer limited to strictly supervised learning approaches."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was funded partially by the National Science Foundation via Grant No. 0910532 entitled “Richer Representations for Machine Translation”.
