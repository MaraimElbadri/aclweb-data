This intuition is made soft in vector-space models (Turney and Pantel, 2010), where we say that expressions in language are paraphrases if their representations are close under some distance measure.","One of the earliest linguistic vector space models was Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). LSA has been successfully used for Information Retrieval but it is limited in its reliance on a single matrix, or view, of term co-occurrences. Here we address the single-view limitation of LSA by demonstrating that the framework of Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCCA) can be used to perform Multiview LSA (MVLSA). This approach allows for the use of an arbitrary number of views in the induc-tion process, including embeddings induced using other algorithms. We also present a fast approximate method for performing GCCA and approxi-","mately recover the objective of (Pennington et al., 2014) while accounting for missing values.","Our experiments show that MVLSA is competitive with state of the art approached for inducing vector representations of words and phrases. As a methodological aside, we discuss the (in-)significance of conclusions being drawn from comparisons done on small sized datasets."]},{"title":"2 Motivation","paragraphs":["LSA is an application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to a term-document cooccurrence matrix. The principal directions found by PCA form the basis of the vector-space in which to represent the input terms (Landauer and Dumais, 1997). A drawback of PCA is that it can leverage only a single source of data and it is sensitive to scaling.","An arguably better approach to representation learning is Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) that induces representations that are maximally correlated across two views, allowing the utilization of two distinct sources of data. While an improvement over PCA, being limited to only two views is unfortunate in light of the fact that many sources of data (perspectives) are frequently available in practice. In such cases it is natural to extend CCA’s original objective of maximizing correlation between two views by maximizing some measure of the matrix Φ that contains all the pairwise correlations between linear projections of the covariates. This is how Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCCA) was first derived by Horst (1961). Recently these intuitive ideas about benefits of leveraging multiple sources of data have received strong theoretical backing due to the work by Sridharan and","556","Kakade (2008) who showed that learning with multiple views is beneficial since it reduces the complexity of the learning problem by restricting the search space. Recent work by Anandkumar et al. (2014) showed that at least three views are necessary for recovering hidden variable models.","Note that there exist different variants of GCCA depending on the measure of Φ that we choose to maximize. Kettenring (1971) enumerated a variety of possible measures, such as the spectral-norm of Φ. Kettenring noted that maximizing this spectral-norm is equivalent to finding linear projections of the covariates that are most amenable to rank-one PCA, or that can be best explained by a single term factor model. This variant was named MAX-VAR GCCA and was shown to be equivalent to a proposal by Carroll (1968), which searched for an auxiliary orthogonal representation G that was maximally correlated to the linear projections of the covariates. Carroll’s objective targets the intuition that representations leveraging multiple views should correlate with all provided views as much as possible."]},{"title":"3 Proposed Method: MVLSA","paragraphs":["Let Xj ∈ RN×dj ∀j ∈ [1, . . . , J ] be the mean centered matrix containing data from view j such that row i of Xj contains the information for word wi.

(7)","Next, to scale up GCCA to large datasets, we first form a rank-m approximation of projection matrices (Arora and Livescu, 2012) and then extend it to an eigendecomposition for M following ideas by Savostyanov (2014). Consider the rank-m SVD of Xj:","Xj = AjSjB⊤ j ,","where Sj ∈ Rm×m is the diagonal matrix with m-largest singular values of Xj and Aj ∈ RN×m and Bj ∈ Rm×dj are the corresponding left and right singular vectors. Given this SVD, write the jth projection matrix as","P̃j = AjS⊤","j (rjI + SjS⊤ J )−1S","jA⊤","j ,","= AjTjT ⊤ j A⊤","j ,","where Tj ∈ Rm×m is a diagonal matrix such that","TjT ⊤ j = S⊤","j (rjI + SjS⊤","J )−1S","j. Finally, we note","557","that the sum of projection matrices can be expressed as M = M̃ M̃ ⊤ where","M̃ = [A1T1 . . .

These left singular vectors can be computed by using Incremental PCA (Brand, 2002) since M̃ may be too large to fit in memory.","3.1 Computing SVD of mean centered Xj","Recall that we assumed Xj to be mean centered matrices. Let Zj ∈ RN×dj be sparse matrices containing mean-uncentered cooccurrence counts. Let fj = nj ◦ tj be the preprocessing function that we apply to Zj:","Yj =fj(Zj), (8) Xj =Yj − 1(1⊤Y","j). (9)","In order to compute the SVD of mean centered matrices Xj we first compute the partial SVD of uncentered matrix Yj and then update it (Brand (2006) provides details). We experimented with representations created from the uncentered matrices Yj and found that they performed as well as the mean centered versions but we would not mention them further since it is computationally efficient to follow the principled approach. We note, however, that even the method of mean-centering the SVD produces an approximation.","3.2 Handling missing rows across views","With real data it may happen that a term was not observed in a view at all. A large number of missing rows can corrupt the learnt representations since the rows in the left singular matrix become zero. To counter this problem we adopt a variant of the “missing-data passive” algorithm from Van De Velden and Bijmolt (2006) who modified the GCCA objective to counter the problem of missing","rows.1 The objective now becomes:","arg min G,Uj","J∑","j=1","∥","∥Kj(G − XjUj) ∥ ∥2","F","subject to G⊤G = I,","(10)","where [Kj]ii = 1 if row i of view j is observed and zero otherwise.

While the approach allows for an arbitrary number of distinct sources of semantic information, such as going further to include cooccurrence in WordNet synsets, we considered the described views to be representative, with further improvements possible as future work.

There are many new methods such as by Yu and Dredze (2014), Faruqui et al. (2014), Hill and Korhonen (2014), and Weston et al. (2014) that are performing multiview learning and could be considered here as baselines: however it is not straightforward to use those systems to handle the variety of data that we are using. Therefore, we directly compare our method to the Glove and the SkipGram model of Word2Vec as the performance of those systems is considered state of the art.

To make a fair comparison we also provide results where we used only the views derived from the Polyglot Wikipedia corpus. See column MVLSA (All Views) and MVLSA (Wiki) respectively. It is clearly visible that MVLSA on the monolingual data itself is competitive with Glove but worse than Word2Vec on the word similarity datasets and it is substantially worse than both the systems on the AN-SYN and AN-SEM datasets. However with the addition of multiple views MVLSA makes substantial gains, shown in column MV Gain, and after consuming the Glove and WSG embeddings it again improves performance by some margins, as shown in column G-WSG Gain, and outperforms the original systems. Using GCCA itself for system combination provides closure for the MVLSA algorithm since multiple distinct approaches can now be simply fused using this method. Finally we contrast the Spearman correlations rs with Glove and Word2Vec before and after including them in the GCCA procedure. The values demonstrate that including Glove and WSG during GCCA actually increased the correlation between them and the learnt embeddings, which supports our motivation for performing GCCA in the first place."]},{"title":"6 Previous Work","paragraphs":["Vector space representations of words have been created using diverse frameworks including Spectral methods (Dhillon et al., 2011; Dhillon et al., 2012), 6 Neural Networks (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Collobert and Lebret, 2013), and Random Projections (Ravichandran et al., 2005; Bhagat and Ravichan-","5We explicitly provided the vocabulary file to Glove and Word2Vec and set the truncation threshold for Word2Vec to 10.

More recently this same phenomenon was reported by Hill et al. (2014a) through their experiments over neural representations learnt from MT systems. Various other researchers have tried to improve the performance of their paraphrase systems or vector space models by using diverse sources of information such as bilingual corpora (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Huang et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2013),10 structured datasets (Yu and Dredze, 2014; Faruqui et al., 2014) or even tagged images (Bruni","10An example of complementary views: Chan et al. (2011) observed that monolingual distributional statistics are susceptible to conflating antonyms, where bilingual data is not; on the other hand bilingual statistics are susceptible to noisy alignments, where monolingual data is not.","563","et al., 2012). However, most previous work11 did not adopt the general, simplifying view that all of these sources of data are just cooccurrence statistics coming from different sources with underlying latent factors.12","Bach and Jordan (2005) presented a probabilistic interpretation for CCA. Though they did not generalize it to include GCCA we believe that one could give a probabilistic interpretation of MAX-VAR GCCA. Such a probabilistic interpretation would allow for an online-generative model of lexical representations, which unlike methods like Glove or LSA would allows us to naturally perplexity or generate sequences. We also note that Vı́a et al. (2007) presented a neural network model of GCCA and adaptive/incremental GCCA. To the best of our knowledge both of these approaches have not been used for word representation learning.","CCA is also an algorithm for multi-view learning (Kakade and Foster, 2007; Ganchev et al., 2008) and when we view our work as an application of multi-view learning to NLP, this follows a long chain of effort started by Yarowsky (1995) and continued with Co-Training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998), CoBoost-ing (Collins and Singer, 1999) and 2 view perceptrons (Brefeld et al., 2006)."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["While previous efforts demonstrated that incorporat-ing two views is beneficial in word-representation learning, we extended that thread of work to a logical extreme and created MVLSA to learn distributed representations using data from 46 views!13 Through evaluation of our induced representations, shown in Table 9, we demonstrated that the MVLSA algorithm is able to leverage the information present in multiple data sources to improve performance on a battery of tests against state of the art baselines. In order to perform MVLSA on large vocabularies","11Ganitkevitch et al. (2013) did employ a rich set of diverse cooccurrence statistics in constructing the initial PPDB, but without a notion of “training” a joint representation beyond random projection to a binary vector subspace (bit-signatures).","12Note that while Faruqui et al. (2014) performed belief propagation over a graph representation of their data, such an undirected weighted graph can be viewed as an adjacency matrix, which is then also a cooccurrence matrix.","13Code and data available at www.cs.jhu.edu/ p̃rastog3/mvlsa","with up to 500K words we presented a fast scalable algorithm. We also showed that a close variant of the Glove objective proposed by Pennington et al. (2014) could be derived as a heuristic for handling missing data under the MVLSA framework. In order to better understand the benefit of using multiple sources of data we performed MVLSA using views derived only from the monolingual Wikipedia dataset thereby providing a more principled alternative of LSA that removes the need for heuristically combining word-word cooccurrence matrices into a single matrix. Finally, while surveying the literature we noticed that not enough emphasis was being given towards establishing the significance of comparative results and proposed a method, (MRDS), to filter out insignificant comparative gains between competing algorithms. Future Work Column MVLSA Wiki of Table 9 shows us that MVLSA applied to monolingual data has mediocre performance compared to the baselines of Glove and Word2Vec on word similarity tasks and performs surprisingly worse on the AN-SEM dataset. We believe that the results could be improved by (1) either using recent methods for handling missing values mentioned in footnote 1 or by using the heuristic count dependent non-linear weighting mentioned by Pennington et al. (2014) and that sits well within our framework as exempli- fied in Expression 12 (2) by using even more views, which look at the future words as well as views that contain PMI values. Finally, we note that Table 8 shows that certain datasets can actually degrade performance over certain metrics. Therefore we are exploring methods for performing discriminative optimization of weights assigned to views, for purposes of task-based customization of learned representations."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This material is based on research sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under the Deep Exploration and Filtering of Text (DEFT) Program, agreement number FA8750-13-2-001, as well as the National Science Foundation (NSF), agreement number BCS-1344269.
