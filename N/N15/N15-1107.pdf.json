We combine this non-probabilistic strategy of inflection table generalization with a discriminative classifier to permit the reconstruction of complete inflection tables of unseen words. Our system learns morphological paradigms from labeled examples of inflection patterns (inflection tables) and then produces inflection tables from unseen lemmas or base forms. We evaluate the approach on datasets covering 11 different languages and show that this approach results in consistently higher accuracies vis-à-vis other methods on the same task, thus indicating that the general method is a viable approach to quickly creating high-accuracy morphological resources."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Use of detailed and sophisticated morphological features has been found to be crucial for many downstream NLP tasks, including part-of-speech tagging and parsing (Tseng et al., 2005; Spoustová et al., 2007). However, creating an accurate widecoverage morphological analyzer for a new language that can be used in tandem with other higher-level analyses is an arduous task.","Learning word inflection patterns by organizing related word-forms into morphological paradigms based on the longest common subsequence (LCS) found in an inflection table has recently been","proposed as a method for supervised and semi-supervised induction of morphological processing tools from labeled data (Ahlberg et al., 2014). Also, the argument that the LCS shared by different in- flected forms of a word—even if discontinuous within a word—corresponds strongly to a crosslinguistic notion of a ‘stem’ has later been advanced independently on grounds of descriptive economy and minimum description length (Lee and Goldsmith, 2014).","We used this idea in (Ahlberg et al., 2014) to create a relatively simple-to-implement system that learns paradigms from example inflection tables and is then able to reconstruct inflection tables for unseen words by comparing suffixes of new base forms to base forms seen during training. The system performs well on available datasets and results in human-readable and editable output. The longest common subsequence strategy itself shows little bias toward any specific morphological process such as prefixation, suffixation, or infixation. Using the model, we argued, a selection of ready-inflected tables could be quickly provided by a linguist, allow-ing rapid development of morphological resources for languages for which few such resources exist.","Potentially, however, the model’s commitment to a simple suffix-based learner is a weakness. To assess this, we evaluate a similar LCS-based generalization system with a more refined discriminative classifier that takes advantage of substrings in the example data and performs careful feature selection. We show that much higher accuracies can be achieved by combining the LCS paradigm generalization strategy with such a feature-based classi-","1024","fier that assigns unknown words to the LCS-learned paradigm based on substring features taken from word edges. This holds in particular for languages where paradigmatic behavior is triggered by material in the beginning of a word (e.g. German verbs).","We present experiments on 18 datasets in 11 languages varying in morphological complexity. In all the experiments, the task is to reconstruct a complete inflection table from a base form, which usually corresponds to the lemma or dictionary form of a noun, verb, or adjective. The experiments are divided into two sets. In the first, we use an earlier dataset (Durrett and DeNero, 2013) of Finnish, German, and Spanish to compare against other methods of paradigm learning. In the second, we use a more comprehensive and complex dataset we have developed for 8 additional languages. This new dataset is less regular and intended to be more realistic in that it also features defective or incomplete inflec-tion tables and inflection tables containing various alternate forms, naturally making the classification task substantially more difficult.1","Overall, supervised and semi-supervised learning of morphology by generalizing patterns from inflec-tion tables is an active research field. Recent work sharing our goals includes Toutanova and Cherry (2009), Dreyer and Eisner (2011), which works with a fully Bayesian model, Dinu et al. (2012), Eskander et al. (2013), which attempts to learn lexicons from morphologically annotated corpora, and Durrett and DeNero (2013), who train a discriminative model that learns transformation rules between word forms. We directly compare our results against the last using the same dataset.","The paper is organized as follows: section 2 contains the experimental setup, section 3 the datasets, and section 4 the results and discussion."]},{"title":"2 Method","paragraphs":["As a first step, our system converts inflection tables into paradigms using a procedure given in Hulden (2014).

First, a large number of in- flection tables are generalized into a smaller number of paradigms; the generalization of the table for höfn ‘harbor’ into a paradigm is illustrated here. At classifica-tion time, an unknown base form is classified into one of the learned paradigms and its inflection table is reconstructed, illustrated here by gjöf ‘present’.","ables. These variables represent abstractions that at table reconstruction time can correspond to any sequence of one or more symbols. As many inflec-tion tables of different words are identical after as-signing the common parts to ‘variables,’ this procedure results in a comparatively small number of paradigms after being input a large number of in- flection tables. The process is illustrated in Figure 1. During generalization, the forms that gave rise to a particular paradigm are stored and later used for training a classifier to assign unknown base forms to paradigms. Having a number of paradigms at our disposal by this generalization method, the task of reconstructing an inflection table for an unseen base form in effect means picking the correct paradigm from among the ones generalized, a standard classi- fication task of choosing the right/best paradigm.","After seeing a number of inflection tables generalized into abstract paradigms as described above, the task we evaluate is how well complete inflection tables can be reconstructed from only seeing an unknown base form. To this end, we train a “one-vs-the-rest” linear multi-class support vector machine (SVM).2 For each example base form wb","i that is a member of paradigm pj, we extract all substrings from wbi from the left and right edges, and use those as binary features corresponding to the paradigm pj.","2Using LIBLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008) with L2regularization.","1025","For example, during training, the German verb lesen would have the following binary features activated: {#l, #le, #les, #lese, #lesen, #lesen#, lesen#, esen#, sen#, en#, n#}.","Before applying the classifier to an unseen base form and reconstructing the corresponding inflection table, many competing paradigms can be ruled out as being ill-matched simply by inspecting the base form. For example, the infinitive for the paradigm containing the English verb sing is generalized as x1+i+x2. At classification time of a verb like run, this paradigm can be ruled out due to incompatibility, as there is no i in run, and so the infinitive cannot be generated. Likewise, the Icelandic paradigm seen in Figure 1 can be ruled out for the base form hest ‘horse’, as the base form does not contain ö. The SVM-classifier may indeed suggest such paradigm assignments, but such classifications are ignored and the highest scoring compatible paradigm is selected instead. These additional constraints on possible base form-paradigm pairings are a general feature of the LCS-strategy and are not at all tied to the classi- fication method here.","2.1 Feature selection","In order to eliminate noise features, we performed feature selection using the development set. We simultaneously tuned the SVM soft-margin penalty parameter C, as well as the length and type (pre- fix/suffix) of substrings to include as features. More concretely, we explored the values using a grid search over C = 0.01 . . . 5.0, with a growing sequence gap (Hsu et al., 2003), as well as tuning the maximum length of anchored substring features to use (3 . . . 9), and whether to include prefix-anchored substrings at all (0/1). In the second experiment, where cross-validation was used, we performed the same tuning procedure on each fold’s development set."]},{"title":"3 Data","paragraphs":["For the first experiment, we use the datasets provided by Durrett and DeNero (2013). This dataset contains complete inflection tables for German nouns and verbs (DE-NOUNS, DE-VERBS), Finnish verbs and nouns combined with adjectives (FI-VERBS, FI-NOUNADJ), and Spanish verbs (ES-","VERBS). The number of inflection tables in this set ranges from 2,027 (DE-VERBS) to 7,249 (FI-VERBS). From these tables, 200 were held out for development and 200 for testing, following the splits that previous authors have used (Durrett and DeNero, 2013; Ahlberg et al., 2014) to ensure a fair baseline.3","For the second experiment, we collected additional inflection tables from Catalan ( CA), English (EN), French (FR), Galician (GL), Italian (IT), Portuguese (PT), Russian (RU) (all from the FreeLing project (Padró and Stanilovsky, 2012)) and Maltese (MT) (Camilleri, 2013).4 These inflection tables are often incomplete or defective and some contain very rarely occurring grammatical forms. Many alternate forms are also given. To avoid having to account for rare or historical forms, we filtered out grammatical forms (slots) that occur in less than ∼1% of all in- flection tables. We also performed an independent cross-check with Wiktionary and removed some in- flection table slots that did not appear in that resource. We further limited the number of inflection tables to 5,000. In the second experiment, we also split each dataset into 5 folds for cross-validation (maximally 4,000 tables for training, 500 for development and 500 for testing for each fold)."]},{"title":"4 Results and discussion","paragraphs":["In the main results tables 1, 2, and 3 we report the per table accuracy and per form accuracy in reconstructing complete inflection tables from unseen base forms. The per table accuracy is the percentage of inflection tables that are perfectly reconstructed from the base form. The per form accuracy is the percentage of correct forms in the reconstructed table.

In experiment 2, where the correct forms may consist of several alternatives, we only count a form as correct if all alternatives are given and all are correct. For example, the verb dream in English lists two alternative past participles, dreamed and dreamt, which both must be reconstructed for the past participle form to count as being correct.","Experiment 1","The accuracies obtained on the first three-language comparison experiment are shown in Table 1. Here, we see a consistent improvement upon the maxsuff -strategy (AFH14) that simply picks the longest matching suffix among the base forms seen and assigns the unseen word to the same paradigm (break-ing ties by paradigm frequency), as well as improvement over other learning strategies (D&DN13). Particularly marked is the improved accuracy on German verbs. We assume that this is because German verb prefixes, which are ignored in a suffix-based classifier, contain information that is useful in classifying verb behavior. German verbs that contain socalled inseparable prefixes like miss-, ver-, widerdo not prefix age- in the past participle form. For example: kaufen ∼ gekauft, brauchen ∼ gebraucht, legen ∼ gelegt, but verkaufen ∼ verkauft, wider-legen ∼ widerlegt, missbrauchen ∼ missbraucht, reflecting the replacement of the standard ge- by the inseparable prefix. There are many such inseparable prefixes that immediately trigger this behavior (although some prefixes only occasionally show inseparable behavior), yet this information is lost when only looking at suffixes at classification time. This analysis is supported by the fact that, during feature","selection, German verbs was the only dataset in this first experiment where word prefixes were not removed by the feature selection process.","Experiment 2","The results of the second experiment are given in tables 2 (per table accuracy) and 3 (per form accuracy). The tables contain information about how many inflection tables were input on average over 5 folds to the learner (#tbl), how many paradigms this reduced to (#par), and how many forms (slots) each paradigm has (#forms). The mfreq column is a baseline where the classifier always picks the most populated paradigm, i.e. the paradigm that resulted from combining the largest number of different in- flection tables by the LCS process. The AFH14 shows the performance of a maximal suffix matching classifier, identical to that used in Ahlberg et al. (2014).","Discussion","Overall, the results support earlier claims that the LCS-generalization appears to capture paradigmatic behavior well, especially if combined with careful classification into paradigms. There is a clear and consistent improvement over baselines that use the same data sets. In addition, the SVM-classifier yields results comparable, and in many cases better, to using a maximum suffix classifier and additionally having access to raw corpus data in the language, a semi-supervised experiment reported separately in Ahlberg et al. (2014). In this work we have not attempted to extend the current method to such a semi-supervised scenario, although such an extension seems both interesting and possible.","1027","Data #tbl #par mfreq AFH14 SVM Oracle","DE-N 2,210 66 18.99 76.09 77.68 98.99 DE-V 1,621 125 52.77 65.02 83.59 95.45 ES-V 3,243 90 70.42 92.25 93.48 96.59 FI-N&A 4,000 233 26.52 83.20 82.84 98.12 FI-V 4,000 204 43.04 91.88 91.64 94.76","MT-V 826 200 10.68 18.83 38.64 85.63","CA-N 4,000 49 44.12 94.00 94.92 99.44 CA-V 4,000 164 60.44 90.76 93.40 98.48 EN-V 4,000 161 77.12 89.40 90.00 97.40 FR-N 4,000 57 92.16 91.60 93.96 98.72 FR-V 4,000 95 81.52 93.72 96.48 98.80 GL-N 4,000 24 88.36 90.48 95.08 99.80 GL-V 3,212 101 45.21 58.92 60.87 98.95 IT-N 4,000 39 83.84 92.32 93.76 99.40 IT-V 4,000 115 63.96 89.68 91.56 98.68 PT-N 4,000 68 74.52 88.12 90.88 99.04 PT-V 4,000 92 62.00 76.96 80.20 99.20 RU-N 4,000 260 15.76 64.12 66.36 96.80","Table 2: Per table accuracy results on the second experiment. 5-fold cross-validation is used throughout.

The #forms-column shows the number of different slots in the paradigms. Other columns are as in table 2.","In some cases, we see a significant drop between the per-form and the per-table accuracy. For example, in the case of Russian nouns, per table accuracy is at 66.36%, while the per-form accuracy is 89.35%. This effect is explained—not only in the Russian case but in many others—by the existence of similar paradigms that differ only in very few forms. If the classifier picks an incorrect, but closely related paradigm, most forms may be produced correctly although the entire reconstructed table counts as wrong if even a single form is incorrect.","A few outliers remain. The Maltese verbs, which exhibit Semitic interdigitation in some paradigms, seem to generalize fairly well, and have a per form oracle score of 95.49 (shown in table 3). However, this is not reflected in the relatively low per form accuracy (61.15), which warrants further analysis. It may be an indication of that the correct paradigm is simply difficult to ascertain based only on the lemma form, or that additional features could be developed, perhaps ones that are discontinuous in the word.","An obvious extension to the current method is to inspect a suggested reconstructed table holistically, i.e., not relying only on base form features. That is, one could avoid making a commitment to a particular paradigm based solely on the features of the base form, and instead also include features from all the forms that a paradigm would generate. Such features are of course available in the training data in the various forms in an inflection table. Features from the seen forms could be used to rate compatibility since an incorrect reconstruction of an inflec-tion table may likely be identified by its tendency to produce phonotactic patterns rarely or never seen in the training data.","With relatively few paradigms learned from collections of word forms, one can achieve fairly high coverage on unseen data. In principle, for example, the 13 most frequently used paradigms of Spanish verbs suffice to cover 90% of all verbs (per token). A useful application of this is rapid language resource development—one can elicit from a speaker a small number of well-chosen inflection tables, e.g. all forms of specific nouns, verbs, adjectives; generalize these inflection tables into paradigms; and use this information to deduce the possible morphological classes for a majority of unseen word forms.","1028"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Malin Ahlberg, Markus Forsberg, and Mans Hulden. 2014.
