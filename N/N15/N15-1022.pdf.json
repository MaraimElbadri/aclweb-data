We introduce a method that improves over past efforts by using a greedy (vs. ordered) search over the document and a word-level semantic similarity score based on Wiktionary (vs. WordNet) that also accounts for structural similarity through syntactic dependencies. Experiments show improved performance on a hand-aligned set, with the largest gain coming from structural similarity. Resulting datasets of manually and automatically aligned sentence pairs are made available."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Text simplification can improve accessibility of texts for both human readers and automatic text processing. Although simplification (Wubben et al., 2012) could benefit from data-driven machine translation, paraphrasing, or grounded language acquisition techniques, e.g. (Callison Burch and Osborne, 2003; Fung and Cheung, 2004; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Smith et al., 2010; Ganitkevitch et al., 2013; Hajishirzi et al., 2012; Kedziorski et al., 2014), work has been limited because available parallel corpora are small (Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007) or automatically generated are noisy (Kauchak, 2013).","Wikipedia is potentially a good resource for text simplification (Napoles and Dredze, 2010; Medero and Ostendorf, 2009), since it includes standard articles and their corresponding simple articles in English. A challenge with automatic alignment is that","standard and simple articles can be written independently so they are not strictly parallel, and have very different presentation ordering. A few studies use editor comments attached to Wikipedia edit logs to extract pairs of simple and difficult words (Yatskar et al., 2010; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011). Other methods use text-based similarity techniques (Zhu et al., 2010; Coster and Kauchak, 2011; Kauchak, 2013), but assume sentences in standard and simple articles are ordered relatively.","In this paper, we align sentences in standard and simple Wikipedia using a greedy method that, for every simple sentence, finds the corresponding sentence (or sentence fragment) in standard Wikipedia. Unlike other methods, we do not make any assumptions about the relative order of sentences in standard and simple Wikipedia articles. We also constrain the many-to-one matches to cover sentence fragments. In addition, our method takes advantage of a novel word-level semantic similarity measure that is built on top of Wiktionary (vs. WordNet) which incorporates structural similarity represented in syntactic dependencies. The Wiktionary-based similarity measure has the advantage of greater word coverage than WordNet, while the use of syntactic dependencies provides a simple mechanism for approximating semantic roles.","Here, we report the first manually annotated dataset for evaluating alignments for text simplifica-tion, develop and assess a series of alignment methods, and automatically generate a dataset of sentence pairs for standard and simple Wikipedia. Experiments show that our alignment method significantly outperforms previous methods on the hand-aligned","211","Good Apple sauce or applesauce is a puree made of apples.

The datasets are publicly available to facilitate further research on text simplification."]},{"title":"2 Background","paragraphs":["Given comparable articles, sentence alignment is achieved by leveraging the sentence-level similarity score and the sequence-level search strategy.","Sentence-Level Scoring: There are two main approaches for sentence-level scoring. One approach, used in Wikipedia alignment (Kauchak, 2013), computes sentence similarities as the cosine distance between vector representations of tf.idf scores of the words in each sentence. Other approaches rely on word-level σ(w, w′) semantic similarity scores s(W, W ′) = 1","Z","∑","w∈W maxw′∈W ′ σ(w, w′)idf (w). Previous work use WordNet-based similarity (Wu and Palmer, 1994; Mohler and Mihalcea, 2009; Hosseini et al., 2014), distributional similarity (Guo and Diab., 2012), or discriminative similarity (Hajishirzi et al., 2010; Rastegari et al., 2015).","In this paper, we leverage pairwise word similarities, and introduce two novel word-level semantic similarity metrics and show that they outperform the previous metrics.","Sequence-Level Search: There are several sequence-level alignment strategies (Shieber and Nelken, 2006). In (Zhu et al., 2010), sentence alignment between simple and standard articles is computed without constraints, so every sentence can be matched to multiple sentences in the other document. Two sentences are aligned if their similarity score is greater than a threshold. An alternative approach is to compute sentence alignment with a sequential constraint, i.e. using dynamic programming (Coster and Kauchak, 2011; Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003). Specifically, the alignment is computed by a recursive function that optimizes alignment of one or two consecutive sentences in one article to sentences","in the other article. This method relies on consistent ordering between two articles, which does not always hold for Wikipedia articles."]},{"title":"3 Simplification Datasets","paragraphs":["We develop datasets of aligned sentences in standard and simple Wikipedia. Here, we describe the manually annotated dataset and leave the details of the automatically generated dataset to Section 5.2.","Manually Annotated: For every sentence in a standard Wikipedia article, we create an HTML survey that lists sentences in the corresponding simple article and allow the annotator to judge each sentence pair as a good, good partial, partial, or bad match (examples in Table 1): Good: The semantics of the simple and standard sentence completely match, possibly with small omissions (e.g., pronouns, dates, or numbers). Good Partial: A sentence completely covers the other sentence, but contains an additional clause or phrase that has information which is not contained within the other sentence. Partial: The sentences discuss unrelated concepts, but share a short related phrase that does not match considerably. Bad: The sentences discuss unrelated concepts.","The annotators were native speaker, hourly paid, undergraduate students. We randomly selected 46 article pairs from Wikipedia (downloaded in June 2012) that started with the character ‘a’. In total, 67,853 sentence pairs were annotated (277 good, 281 good partial, 117 partial, and 67,178 bad). The kappa value for interannotator agreement is 0.68 (13% of articles were dual annotated). Most disagreements between annotators are confusions between ‘partial’ and ‘good partial’ matches. The manually annotated dataset is used as a test set for evaluating alignment methods as well as tuning parameters for generating automatically aligned pairs across standard and simple Wikipedia.","212"]},{"title":"4 Sentence Alignment Method","paragraphs":["We use a sentence-level similarity score that builds on a new word-level semantic similarity, described below, together with a greedy search over the article.","4.1 Word-Level Similarity","Word-level similarity functions return a similarity score σ(w1, w2) between words w1 and w2. We introduce two novel similarity metrics: Wiktionary-based similarity and structural semantic similarity.","WikNet Similarity: The Wiktionary-based semantic similarity measure leverages synonym information in Wiktionary as well as word-definition cooccurrence, which is represented in a graph and referred to as WikNet. In our work, each lexical content word (noun, verb, adjective and adverb) in the English Wiktionary is represented by one node in WikNet. If word w2 appears in any of the sense definitions of word w1, one edge between w1 and w2 is added, as illustrated in Figure 1. We prune the WikNet using the following steps: i) morphological variations are mapped to their baseforms; ii) atypical word senses (e.g. “obsolete,” “Jamaican English”) are removed; and iii) stopwords (determined based on high definition frequency) are removed. After pruning, there are roughly 177k nodes and 1.15M undirected edges. As expected, our Wiktionary based similarity metric has a higher coverage of 71.8% than WordNet, which has a word coverage of 58.7% in our annotated dataset.","Motivated by the fact that the WikNet graph structure is similar to that of many social networks (Watts and Strogatz, 1998; Wu, 2012), we characterize semantic similarity with a variation on a link-based node similarity algorithm that is commonly applied for person relatedness evaluations in social network studies, the Jaccard coefficient (Salton and McGill, 1983), by quantifying the number of shared neighbors for two words. More specifically, we use the extended Jaccard coefficient, which looks at neighbors within an n-step reach (Fogaras and Racz, 2005) with an added term to indicate whether the words are direct neighbors. In addition, if the words or their neighbors have synonym sets in Wiktionary, then the shared synonyms are used in the extended Jaccard measure. If the two words are in each other’s synonym lists, then the similarity is set to","boy: sense1: a young male man sense2: ... ","lad ","young boy ","man ","male ","lad: sense1: a boy or a young man sense2: ... Figure 1: Part of WikNet","with words “boy” and “lad”.","1 otherwise, σwk(w1, w2) =","∑n l=0 J s","l (w1, w2), for","J s l (w1, w2) =","Γl(w1)∩synΓl(w2)","Γl(w1)∪Γl(w2) where Γl(wi) is the l-step neighbor set of wi, and ∩syn accounts for synonyms if any. We precomputed similarities between pairs of words in WikNet to make the alignment algorithm more efficient. The WikNet is available at http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/ tial/projects/simplification/.","Structural Semantic Similarity: We extend the word-level similarity metric to account for both semantic similarity between words, as well as the dependency structure between the words in a sentence. We create a triplet for each word using Stanford’s dependency parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006). Each triplet tw = (w, h, r) consists of the given word w, its head word h (governor), and the dependency relationship (e.g., modifier, subject, etc) between w and h. The similarity between words w1 and w2 combines the similarity between these three features in order to boost the similarity score of words whose head words are similar and appear in the same dependency structure: σsswk (w1, w2) = σwk(w1, w2) + σwk(h1, h2)σr(r1, r2) where σwk is the WikNet similarity and σr(r1, r2) represents dependency similarity between relations r1 and r2 such that σr = 0.5 if both relations fall into the same category, otherwise σr = 0.","4.2 Greedy Sequence-level Alignment","To avoid aligning multiple sentences to the same content, we require one-to-one matches between sentences in standard and simple Wikipedia articles using a greedy algorithm. We first compute similarities between all sentences Sj in the simple article and Ai in standard article using a sentence-level similarity score. Then, our method iteratively selects the most similar sentence pair S∗, A∗ = arg max s(Sj, Ai) and removes all other pairs associated with the respective sentences, repeating until all sentences in the shorter document are aligned. The cost of aligning sentences in two articles S, A is O(mn) where m, n are the number of sentences in","213","Figure 2: Precision-recall curve for our method vs. baselines.","articles S and A, respectively. The run time of our method using WikNet is less than a minute for the sentence pairs in our test set.","Many simple sentences only match with a fragment of a standard sentence. Therefore, we extend the greedy algorithm to discover good partial matches as well. The intuition is that two sentences are good partial matches if a simple sentence has higher similarity with a fragment of a standard sentence than the complete sentence. We extract frag-ments for every sentence from the Stanford syntactic parse tree (Klein and Manning, 2003). The frag-ments are generated based on the second level of the syntactic parse tree. Specifically, each fragment is a S, SBAR, or SINV node at this level. We then calculate the similarity between every simple sentence Sj with every standard sentence Ai as well as frag-ments of the standard sentence Ak","i . The same greedy algorithm is then used to align simple sentences with standard sentences or their fragments."]},{"title":"5 Experiments","paragraphs":["We test our method on all pairs of standard and simple sentences for each article in the hand-annotated data (no training data is used). For our experiments, we preprocess the data by removing topic names, list markers, and non-English words. In addition, the data was tokenized, lemmatized, and parsed using Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014).","5.1 Results","Comparison to Baselines: The baselines are our implementations of previous work: Unconstrained WordNet (Mohler and Mihalcea, 2009), which uses an unconstrained search for aligning sentences and WordNet semantic similarity (in particular Wu-Palmer (1994)); Unconstrained Vector Space (Zhu","Good vs. Others Max F1 AUC Greedy Struc.

Figure 2 and Table 2 show that our method achieves higher precision-recall, max F1, and AUC compared to the baselines. The precision-recall score is computed for good pairs vs. other pairs (good partial, partial, and bad).","From error analysis, we found that most mistakes are caused by missing good matches (lower recall). As shown by the graph, we obtain high precision (about .9) at recall 0.5.

In all the experiments, we use the sequence-level greedy alignment method. The structural semantic similarity measures improve over the corresponding similarity measures for both WordNet and WikNet. Moreover, WikNet similarity outperforms WordNet, and the structural semantic WikNet similarity measure achieves the best performance.","5.2 Automatically Aligned Data","We develop a parallel corpus of aligned sentence pairs between standard and simple Wikipedia, together with their similarity scores.

The selected thresholds yield around 150k good matches, 130k good partial matches, and 110k uncategorized matches. In addition, around 51.5 million potential matches, with a scaled score below 0.45, are pruned from the dataset."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["This work introduces a sentence alignment method for text simplification using a new word-level similarity measure (using Wiktionary and dependency structure) and a greedy search over sentences and sentence fragments.
