Borrowed words are found in all languages, and—in contrast to cognate relationships—borrowing relationships may exist across unrelated languages (for example, about 40% of Swahili’s vocabulary is borrowed from Arabic). In this paper, we develop a model of morpho-phonological transformations across languages with features based on universal constraints from Optimality Theory (OT). Compared to several standard— but linguistically naïve—baselines, our OT-inspired model obtains good performance with only a few dozen training examples, making this a cost-effective strategy for sharing lexical information across languages."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["We may imagine that globalization is a modern phenomenon, but the lexicons of the world’s languages attest to the fact that robust interaction between communities of speakers of different languages is widespread throughout history. Language contact breeds linguistic borrowing—a phenomenon as old as language itself—adoption and nativization of phonemes, morphemes, words, and syntactic constructions from another language (Thomason and Kaufman, 2001).","Contact-induced borrowing is a fundamental research topic in linguistics; however, in computational","linguistics, very limited work has addressed modeling this phenomenon. The problem we address is the identification of plausible donor words (in the donor language) given a loanword (in the recipient language), and vice versa, identification of loanwords given a donor. For example, given a Swahili loanword safari ‘journey’, our model identifies its Arabic donor éK Q"," ","® (sfryh)1 ‘journey’ (§2). Although at a high level, this is an instance of the well-known problem of modeling string transductions, our interest is being able to identify correspondences across languages with minimal supervision, so as to make the technique applicable in low-resource settings. To reduce the supervision burden, we propose a model that includes awareness of the morpho-phonological repair strategies that native speakers of a language subconsciously employ to adapt a loanword to phonological constraints of the recipient language (§3). To this end, we use constraint-based theories of phonology, as exemplified by Optimality Theory (OT) (Prince and Smolensky, 2008; McCarthy, 2009), which non-computational linguistic work has demonstrated to be particularly well suited to account for phonologically complex borrowing processes (Kang, 2011). We operationalize OT constraints as features in our borrowing model (§4).","We conduct a case study on Arabic and Swahili, two unrelated languages with a long history of contact; we then apply the model to additional language pairs (§5).

While modeling string transductions is a well-studied problem in NLP, we wish to be able to learn the cross-lingual correspondences from minimal amounts of data, so we propose a linguistically-motivated approach: we formulate a scoring model inspired by Optimality Theory (OT; discussed below), in which borrowing candidates are ranked by universal constraints posited to underly the human faculty of language, and the candidates are determined by transduction processes articulated in prior studies of contact linguistics.","As shown in figure 1, our model is conceptually divided into three main parts: (1) mapping of orthographic word forms in two languages into a common space of their phonetic representation; (2) generation of loanword pronunciation candidates from a donor word; (3) ranking of generated loanword candidates, based on linguistic constraints of the donor and recipient languages. Parts (1) and (2) are rule-based; whereas (3) is learned. Each component of the model is discussed in detail in the following sections.","The model is implemented within a finite-state cascade. Parts (1) and (2) amount to unweighted string transformation operations. In (1), we convert orthographic word forms to their pronunciations in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), these are pronunciation transducers. In (2) we syllabify donor pronunciations, then perform insertion, deletion, and substitution of phonemes and morphemes (affixes), to generate multiple loanword candidates from a donor word. Although string transformation transducers in (2) can generate loanword candidates that are not found in a recipient language vocabulary, such can-","didates are filtered out due to composition with the recipient language lexicon acceptor.","We perform string transformations from donor to recipient (recapitulating the historical process). How-ever, the resulting relation (i.e., the final composed transducer) is a bidirectional model which can just as well be used to reason about underlying donor forms given recipient forms. To employ the model in a specific direction, one needs to optimize parameters— weights on transitions—to generate a desired set of outputs from a specific input. Our model is trained to discriminate a donor word given a loanword. In part (3), candidates are “evaluated” (i.e., scored) with a weighted sum of universal constraint violations. The non-negative weights, which we call “cost vector”, constitute our model parameters and are learned using a small training set of donor–recepient pairs. We use a shortest path algorithm to find the path with the minimal cost.","OT: constraint-based evaluation Our decision to evaluate borrowing candidates by weighting counts of “constraint violations” is based on Optimality Theory, which has shown that complex surface phenomena can be well-explained as the interaction of constraints on the form of outputs and the relationships of inputs and outputs (Kager, 1999). Although our linear scoring scheme departs from OT’s standard evaluation assumptions (namely, the assumption of an ordinal constraint ranking and strict dominance rather than constraint “weighting”), we are still able to obtain effective models.","Although originally a theory of monolingual phonology, OT has been adapted to account for borrowing by treating the donor language word as the underlying form for the recipient language; that is,","599","the phonological system of the recipient language is encoded as a system of constraints, and these constraints account for how the donor word is adapted when borrowed. There has been substantial prior work in linguistics on borrowing in the OT paradigm (Yip, 1993; Davidson and Noyer, 1997; Jacobs and Gussenhoven, 2000; Kang, 2003; Broselow, 2004; Adler, 2006; Rose and Demuth, 2006; Kenstowicz and Suchato, 2006; Kenstowicz, 2007; Mwita, 2009), but none of it has led to computational realizations."]},{"title":"3 Generating loanword candidates","paragraphs":["In this section, we use the Arabic–Swahili language-pair to describe the prototypical linguistic adaptation processes that words undergo when borrowed. Then, we describe how we model these processes.2","3.1 Case study: Arabic–Swahili borrowing","The Swahili lexicon has been influenced by Arabic due to a prolonged period of language contact in the Indian Ocean trading (800 A.D.–1920), as well as the influence of Islam (Rothman, 2002). According to several independent studies, Arabic loanwords constitute from 18% (Hurskainen, 2004) to 40% (Johnson, 1939) of Swahili word types.","Despite a strong susceptibility of Swahili to borrowing and a large fraction of Swahili words originat-ing from Arabic, the two languages are typologically distinct with profoundly dissimilar phonological and morpho-syntactic systems. Therefore, Arabic loanwords have been substantially adapted to conform to Swahili phonotactics, which we survey briefly. First, Arabic has five syllable patterns:3 CV, CVV, CVC, CVCC, and CVVC (McCarthy, 1985, pp. 23–28), whereas Swahili (like other Bantu languages) is characterized by the syllable ending with a vowel and CV or V syllable structure. At the segment level, Swahili loanword adaptation thus involves extensive vowel epenthesis in consonant clusters and at a syllable fi- nal position if the syllable ends with a consonant, e.g., : H. AJ» (ktAb) → kitabu ‘book’ (Polomé, 1967; Schadeberg, 2009; Mwita, 2009). Second, phonological adaptation in Swahili loanwords includes shorten-ing of vowels (unlike Arabic, Swahili does not have","2For simplicity, we subsume Omani Arabic and other historical dialects of Arabic under the label “Arabic”; similarly, we subsume Swahili, its dialects and protolanguages under “Swahili”.","3C stands for consonant, and V for vowel.","phonemic length); substitution of consonants that are found in Arabic but not in Swahili (e.g., emphatic (pharyngealized) /tQ/→/t/, voiceless velar fricative /x/→/k/, dental fricatives /T/→/s/, /D/→/z/, and the voiced velar fricative /G/→/g/); adoption of Arabic phonemes that were not originally present in Swahili /T/, /D/, /G/ (e.g., QK "]},{"title":" Ym'","paragraphs":["(tH*yr)→ tahadhari ‘warning’); degemination of Arabic geminate consonants (e.g., Qå ($r~)→ shari ‘evil’). Finally, adapted loanwords can freely undergo Swahili inflectional and derivational processes, e.g., QK PñË@ (Alwzyr) → waziri ‘minister’, mawaziri ‘ministers’, kiuwaziri ‘ministerial’ (Zawawi, 1979; Schadeberg, 2009).","3.2 Arabic–Swahili borrowing transducers","We describe unweighted transducers for pronunciation, syllabification, and morphological and phonological adaptation. An example that illustrates some of the possible string transformations by individual components of the model is shown in figure 2. The goal of these transducers is to minimally overgenerate Swahili adapted forms of Arabic words, based on the adaptations described above.","Pronunciation. Based on the IPA, we assign shared symbols to sounds that exist in both sound systems of Arabic and Swahili (e.g., nasals /n/, /m/; voiced stops /b/, /d/), and language-specific unique symbols to sounds that are unique to the phonemic inventory of Arabic (e.g., pharyngeal voiced and voiceless fricatives /è/, /Q/) or Swahili (e.g., velar nasal /N/). For Swahili, we construct a pronunciation dictionary based on the Omniglot grapheme-to-IPA mapping.4 In Arabic, we use the CMU Arabic vowelized pronunciation dictionary containing about 700K types which has an average of four pronunciations per word (Metze et al., 2010).5 We then design four transducers—Arabic and Swahili word-to-IPA and IPA-to-word transducers—each as a union of linear chain transducers, as well as one acceptor per pronunciation dictionary listing.","4www.omniglot.com","5Since we are working at the level of word types which have no context, we cannot disambiguate the intended form, so we include all options.

AJ» (ktAbA) ‘book.sg.indef’ transformed by our model into a Swahili loanword kitabu.","Syllabification. Arabic words borrowed into Swahili undergo a repair of violations of the Swahili segmental and phonotactic constraints, for example via vowel epenthesis in a consonant cluster. Importantly, repair depends upon syllabification. To simulate plausible phonological repair processes, we generate multiple syllabification variants for input pronunciations. The syllabification transducer optionally inserts syllable separators between phones. For example, for an input phonetic sequence /kuttAbA/, the output strings include /ku.t.tA.bA/, /kut.tA.bA/, and /ku.ttA.bA/ as syllabification variants; each variant violates different constraints and consequently triggers different phonological adaptation.","Phonological adaptation. Phonological adaptation of syllabified phone sequences is the crux of the loanword adaptation process. We implement phonological adaptation transducers as a composition of plausible context-dependent insertions, deletions, and substitutions of phone subsets, based on prior studies summarized in §3.1. In what follows, we list phonological adaptation components in the order of transducer composition in the borrowing model. The vowel deletion transducer shortens Arabic long vowels and vowel clusters. The consonant degemination transducer shortens Arabic geminate consonants, e.g., it degeminates /tt/ in /ku.ttA.bA/, outputting /ku.tA.bA/. The substitution of similar phonemes transducer substitutes similar phonemes and phonemes that are found in Arabic but not in Swahili (Polomé, 1967, p. 45). For example, the emphatic /tQ/, /dQ/, /sQ/ are replaced by the correspond-ing non-emphatic segments [t], [d], [s]. The vowel epenthesis transducer inserts a vowel between pairs of consonants (/ku.ttA.bA/ → /ku.tatA.bA/), and at the end of a syllable, if the syllable ends with a con-","sonant (/ku.t.tA.bA/ → /ku.ta.tA.bA/). Sometimes it is possible to predict the final vowel of a word, depending on the word-final coda consonant of its Arabic counterpart: /u/ or /o/ added if an Arabic donor ends with a labial, and /i/ or /e/ added after coronals and dorsals (Mwita, 2009). Following these rules, the final vowel substitution transducer complements the inventory of final vowels in loanword candidates.","Morphological adaptation. Both Arabic and Swahili have significant morphological processes that alter the appearance of lemmas. To deal with morphological variants, we construct morphological adaptation transducers that optionally strip Arabic concatenative affixes and clitics, and then optionally append Swahili affixes, generating a superset of all possible loanword hypotheses. We obtain the list of Arabic affixes from the Arabic morphological analyzer SAMA (Maamouri et al., 2010); the Swahili affixes are taken from a hand-crafted Swahili morphological analyzer (Littell et al., 2014)."]},{"title":"4 Learning constraint weights","paragraphs":["Due to the computational problems of working with OT (Eisner, 1997; Eisner, 2002), we make simplifying assumptions by (1) bounding the theoretically infinite set of underlying forms with a small linguistically-motivated subset of allowed transformations on donor pronunciations, as described in §3; (2) imposing a priori restrictions on the set of the surface realizations by intersecting the candidate set with the recipient pronunciation lexicon; (3) assum-ing that the set of constraints is finite and regular (Ellison, 1994); and (4) assigning linear weights to constraints, rather than learning an ordinal constraint ranking (Boersma and Hayes, 2001; Goldwater and","601","Faithfulness constraints","MAX-IO-MORPH no (donor) affix deletion MAX-IO-C no consonant deletion MAX-IO-V no vowel deletion DEP-IO-MORPH no (recipient) affix epenthesis DEP-IO-V no vowel epenthesis IDENT-IO-C no consonant substitution IDENT-IO-C-M no subst. in manner of pronunciation IDENT-IO-C-A no subst. in place of articulation IDENT-IO-C-S no subst. in sonority IDENT-IO-C-P no pharyngeal consonant substitution IDENT-IO-C-G no glottal consonant substitution IDENT-IO-C-E no emphatic consonant substitution IDENT-IO-V no vowel substitution IDENT-IO-V-O no subst. in vowel openness IDENT-IO-V-R no subst. in vowel roundness IDENT-IO-V-F no subst. in vowel frontness IDENT-IO-V-FIN no final vowel substitution","Table 1: Faithfulness constraints prefer pronounced realizations completely congruent with their underlying forms.","Johnson, 2003).","OT distinguishes “markedness” constraints (McCarthy and Prince, 1995), which detect dispreferred phonetic patterns in the language, and “faithfulness” constraints (Prince and Smolensky, 2008), which ensure correspondences between the underlying form and the surface candidates.6 The implemented constraints are listed in tables 1 and 2.

The first aspect is designed to evaluate whether the morpho-phonological transformations implemented in the model are required and sufficient to generate loanwords from the donor inputs. We report two evaluation measures: model reachability and ambiguity. Reachability is a percentage of test samples that are reachable (i.e., there is a path from the input test example to a correct output) in the loanword transducer. A naïve model which generates all possible strings would score 100% reachability, but it will be hard to set the model parameters such that it discriminates between good and bad candidates. In order to capture this trade-off, we also report the inherent ambiguity of our model, which is the average number of outputs potentially generated per input. A generic Arabic– Swahili transducer, for example, has an ambiguity of 786,998—the size of the Arabic pronunciation lexicon.","Results The borrowing model reachability and ambiguity are listed in table 3. The model obtains high reachability, while significantly reducing the average number of possible outputs per input: in Arabic from 787K to 857 words, in French from 62K to 12. This result shows that the loanword transducer design, based on the prior linguistic analysis, is a plausible model of word borrowing. Yet, there are on average 33 correct Arabic words out of the possible 857 outputs, thus the second part of the model—OT constraint weights optimization—is crucial.","The accuracy results in table 4 show how challenging the task of modeling lexical borrowing between two distinct languages is, and importantly, that orthographic and phonetic baselines including the state-of-the-art generative model of transliteration are not suitable for this task.

In this section we first situate the task with respect to two most closely related research directions: modeling transliteration and cognate forms. We then motivate the new line of research proposed in this work: modeling borrowing.","Borrowing vs. transliteration Borrowing is not transliteration. Transliteration refers to writing in a different orthography, whereas borrowing refers to expanding a language to include words adapted from another language. Unlike borrowing, transliteration is more amenable to orthographic—rather than morpho-phonological—features, although see (Knight and Graehl, 1998). Borrowed words might have begun as transliterations, but a characteristic of borrowed words is that they become assimilated in the linguistic system of the recipient language, and became regular content words, e.g., ‘orange’ and ‘sugar’ are English words borrowed from Arabic l . '","PA K (nArnj) and QoË@ (Alskr), respectively.","14We chose examples from the Arabic–Swahili system be-cause this is a more challenging case due to linguistic discrepancies.","Borrowing vs. inheritance Cognates are words in related languages inherited from one word in a common ancestral language (the proto-language). Loanwords, on the other hand, can occur between any languages, either related or not, that historically came into contact. Theoretical analysis of cognates has tended to be concerned with a diachronic point of view, i.e., modeling word changes across time. While of immense scientific interest, language processing applications are arguably better served by models of synchronic processes, peculiar to loanword analysis.","Why borrowing? Borrowing is a distinctive and pervasive phenomenon: all languages borrowed from other languages at some point in their lifetime, and borrowed words constitute a large fraction of most language lexicons. Another important property of borrowing is that in adaptation of borrowed items, changes in words are systematic, knowledge of morphological and phonological patterns in a language can be used to predict how borrowings will be realized in that language, without having to list them all. Therefore, modeling of borrowing is a task well-suited for computational approaches.","Our suggestion in this work is that we can identify borrowing relations between resource-limited languages and resource-rich donor languages, such as English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian. For example, 30–70% of the vocabulary in Vietnamese, Cantonese, and Thai—relatively resource-limited languages spoken by hundreds of millions of people—are borrowed from Chinese and English. Similarly, African languages have been greatly in- fluenced by Arabic, Spanish, English, and French— widely spoken languages such as Swahili, Zulu, Malagasy, Hausa, Tarifit, Yoruba contain up to 40% of loanwords. Indo-Iranian languages—Hindustani, Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Persian, Pashto—spoken by 860 million, also extensively borrowed from Arabic and English (Haspelmath and Tadmor, 2009). In","605","short, at least a billion people are speaking resourcescarce languages whose lexicons are heavily borrowed from resource-rich languages.","Why is this important? Lexical translations or alignments extracted from large parallel corpora have been widely used to project annotations from high- to low-resource languages (Hwa et al., 2005; Täckström et al., 2013; Ganchev et al., 2009; Tsvetkov et al., 2014, inter alia). Unfortunately, parallel resources are unavailable for the majority of resource-limited languages. Loanwords can be used as a source of cross-lingual links complementary to lexical alignments. This holds promise for applying existing cross-lingual methods and bootstrapping linguistic resources in languages where no parallel data is avail-able."]},{"title":"8 Related work","paragraphs":["With the exception of a study conducted by Blair and Ingram (2003) on generation of borrowed phonemes in English–Japanese language pair (the method does not generalize from borrowed phonemes to borrowed words, and does not rely on linguistic insights), we are not aware of any prior work on computational modeling of lexical borrowing. Few papers only men-tion or tangentially address borrowing, we briefly list them here. Daumé III (2009) focuses on areal effects on linguistic typology, a broader phenomenon that includes borrowing and genetic relations across languages. This study is aimed at discovering language areas based on typological features of languages. Garley and Hockenmaier (2012) train a maxent classifier with character n-gram and morphological features to identify anglicisms (which they compare to loanwords) in an online community of German hip hop fans. List and Moran (2013) have published a toolkit for computational tasks in historical linguistics but remark that “Automatic approaches for borrowing detection are still in their infancy in historical linguistics.”","Two related lines of research are transliteration and cognate identification. Knight and Graehl (1998), Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002) developed a finite-state generative model of transliteration, and successfully applied it to Arabic–English named entity translation. Mann and Yarowsky (2001) and Kondrak (2001) identify cognate pairs, based on the learned surface","and phonetic similarities, respectively. As our experiments confirm, orthographic and phonetic transliteration and string edit distance methods are not adequate models for the complex borrowing phenomena."]},{"title":"9 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Given a loanword, our model identifies plausible donor words in a contact language. We show that a discriminative model with Optimality Theoretic features effectively models systematic phonological changes in Arabic–Swahili loanwords. We also found that the model and methodology is generally applicable to other language pairs with minimal engineering effort.","This paper makes two contributions: (1) To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computational model of lexical borrowing. (2) While there are implementations of OT (Hayes et al., 2013), they are used chiefly to facilitate linguistic analysis.","There are numerous research questions that we would like to explore further. Is it possible to monolingually identify borrowed words in a language? Can we automatically identify a donor language (or its phonological properties) for a borrowed word? Since languages may borrow from many sources, can jointly modeling this process lead to better performance? Can we reduce the amount of language-specific engineering required to deploy our model? Can we integrate knowledge of borrowing in downstream NLP applications? We intend to address these questions in future work."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was supported by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the U.S. Army Research Office under contract/grant number W911NF-10-1-0533.
