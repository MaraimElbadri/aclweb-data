We apply this model to the problem of inducing the social function of address terms, such as Madame, comrade, and dude.

However, large-scale empirical work on understanding this communicative function has been stymied by a lack of labeled data: it is not clear what to annotate, let alone whether and how such annotations can be produced reliably. Computational linguistics has made great progress in modeling language’s informational dimension,","1Code and data for this paper is available at https:// github.com/vinodhkris/signed-social.","but — with a few notable exceptions — computa-tion has had little to contribute to our understanding of language’s social dimension.","Yet there is a rich theoretical literature on social structures and dynamics. In this paper, we focus on one such structure: signed social networks, in which edges between individuals are annotated with information about the nature of the relationship. For example, the individuals in a dyad may be friends or foes; they may be on formal or informal terms; or they may be in an asymmetric power relationship. Several theories characterize signed social networks: in structural balance theory, edge signs indicate friendship and enmity, with some triads of signed edges being stable, and others being unstable (Cartwright and Harary, 1956); conversely, in status theory (Leskovec et al., 2010b), edges indicate status differentials, and triads should obey transitivity. But these theoretical models can only be applied when the sign of each social network connection is known, and they do not answer the sociolinguistic question of how the sign of a social tie relates to the language that is exchanged across it.","We present a unified statistical model that incorporates both network structure and linguistic content. The model connects signed social networks with address terms (Brown and Ford, 1961), which include names, titles, and “placeholder names,” such as dude. The choice of address terms is an indicator of the level of formality between the two parties: for example, in contemporary North American English, a formal relationship is signaled by the use of titles such as Ms and Mr, while an informal relationship is signaled by the use of first names and","1616","placeholder names. These tendencies can be captured with a multinomial distribution over address terms, conditioned on the nature of the relationship. However, the linguistic signal is not the only indicator of formality: network structural properties can also come into play. For example, if two individuals share a mutual friend, with which both are on informal terms, then they too are more likely to have an informal relationship. With a log-linear prior distribution over network structures, it is possible to in-corporate such triadic features, which relate to structural balance and status theory.","Given a dataset of unlabeled network structures and linguistic content, inference in this model simultaneously induces three quantities of interest:","• a clustering of network edges into types;","• a probabilistic model of the address terms that are used across each edge type, thus revealing the social meaning of these address terms;","• weights for triadic features of signed networks, which can then be compared with the predictions of existing social theories.","Such inferences can be viewed as a form of sociolinguistic structure induction, permitting social meanings to be drawn from linguistic data. In addi-tion to the model and the associated inference procedure, we also present an approach for inducing a lexicon of address terms, and for tagging them in dialogues. We apply this procedure to a dataset of movie scripts (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lee, 2011). Quantitative evaluation against human ratings shows that the induced clusters of address terms correspond to intuitive perceptions of formality, and that the network structural features improve predictive likelihood over a purely text-based model. Qualitative evaluation shows that the model makes reasonable predictions of the level of formality of social network ties in well-known movies.","We first describe our model for linking network structure and linguistic content in general terms, as it can be used for many types of linguistic content and edge labels. Next we describe a procedure which semi-automatically induces a lexicon of address terms, and then automatically labels them in text. We then describe the application of this proce-","dure to a dataset of movie dialogues, including quantitative and qualitative evaluations."]},{"title":"2 Joint model of signed social networks and textual content","paragraphs":["We now present a probabilistic model for linking network structure with content exchanged over the network. In this section, the model is presented in general terms, so that it can be applied to any type of event counts, with any form of discrete edge labels. The application of the model to forms of address is described in Sections 4 and 5.","We observe a dataset of undirected graphs G(t) = {i, j}, with a total ordering on nodes such that i < j in all edges. For each edge ⟨i, j⟩, we observe directed content vectors xi→j and xi←j, which may represent counts of words or other discrete events, such as up-votes and down-votes for comments in a forum thread. We hypothesize a latent edge label yij ∈ Y, so that xi→j and xi←j are conditioned on yij. In this paper we focus on binary labels (e.g., Y = {+, −}), but the approach generalizes to larger finite discrete sets, such as directed binary labels (e.g., Y = {++, +−, −+, −−}) and comparative status labels (e.g., Y = {<, >, ≈}).","We model the likelihood of the observations conditioned on the edge labels as multinomial,","xi→j | yij ∼Multinomial(θ→","yij ) (1)","xi←j | yij ∼Multinomial(θ←","yij ). (2)","Parameter tying can be employed to handle spe-","cial cases.

The first term of Equation 3 represents a normalizing constant. The second term includes weights η, which apply to network features f (yij, i, j, G). This can include features like the number of mutual friends between nodes i and j, or any number of more elaborate structural features (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg, 2007). For example, the feature weights η could ensure that the edge label Yij = + is especially likely when nodes i and j have many mutual friends in G. However, these features cannot consider any edge labels besides yij.","In the third line of Equation 3, each weight βyij,yjk,yik corresponds to a signed triad type, invariant to rotation. In a binary signed network, structural balance theory would suggest positive weights for β+++ (all friends) and β+−− (two friends and a mutual enemy), and negative weights for β++− (two enemies and a mutual friend) and β−−− (all enemies). In contrast, a status-based network theory would penalize non-transitive triads such as β>><. Thus, in an unsupervised model, we can examine the weights to learn about the semantics of the induced edge types, and to see which theory best describes the signed network configurations that follow from the linguistic signal. This is a natural next step from prior work that computes the frequency of triads in explicitly-labeled signed social networks (Leskovec et al., 2010b)."]},{"title":"3 Inference and estimation","paragraphs":["Our goal is to estimate the parameters θ, β, and η, given observations of network structures G(t) and linguistic content x(t), for t ∈ {1, . . . , T }.

This dataset gives the identity of the speaker and addressee of each line of dialogue. These identities constitute a minimal form of manual annotation, but in many settings, such as social media dialogues, they could be obtained automatically. We augment this data by obtaining the first (given) and last (family) names of each character, which we mine from the website rottentomatoes.com. Next, we apply the CoreNLP part-of-speech tagger (Manning et al., 2014) to identify sequences of the NNP tag, which indicates a proper noun in the Penn Treebank Tagset (Marcus et al., 1993). For","each NNP tag sequence that contains the name of the addressee, we label it as an address, using BILOU notation (Ratinov and Roth, 2009): Beginning, Inside, and Last term of address segments; Outside and Unit-length sequences. An example of this tagging scheme is shown in Figure 1.","Next, we train a classifier (Support Vector Machine with a linear kernel) on this automatically labeled data, using the features shown in Table 2. For simplicity, we do not perform structured prediction, which might offer further improvements in accuracy. This classifier provides an initial, partial solution to the first problem, distinguishing second-person addresses from references to other individuals (for name references only). On heldout data, the classifier’s macro-averaged F-measure is 83%, and its micro-averaged F-measure is 98.7%. Class-by-class breakdowns are shown in Table 3.","4.1 Address term lexicons","To our surprise, we were unable to find manually-labeled lexicons for either titles or placeholder names.

Of these 34 candidate terms, we manually filter out 17, which are mainly common first names, such asJohn; such names are frequently labeled as B-ADDR across movies. After this manual filtering, we obtain the following titles: agent, aunt, captain, colonel, commander, cousin, deputy, detective, dr, herr, inspector, judge, lord, master, mayor, miss, mister, miz, monsieur, mr, mrs, ms, professor, queen, reverend, sergeant, uncle.","1620","Placeholder names To induce a lexicon of placeholder names, we remove the CURRENT-WORD feature from the model, and re-run the tagger on all dialogue data. We then focus on terms which are frequently labeled U-ADDR, indicating that they are the sole token in the address (e.g., I’m/O perfectly/O calm/O, dude/U-ADDR.) We again perform a binomial test to obtain a list of terms whose frequency of being labeled U-ADDR is significantly higher than chance. We manually filter out 41 terms from a list of 96 possible placeholder terms obtained in the previous step. Most terms eliminated were plural forms of placeholder names, such as fellas and dudes; these are indeed address terms, but because they are plural, they cannot refer to a single individual, as required by our model.

We treat Y = V as indicating formality and Y = T as indicating informality.

Our work shows that it is possible to detect formality without labeled data or parallel text, by leveraging regularities across network structures; however, this requires the assump-tion that the level of formality for a pair of individuals is constant over time. The combination of our unsupervised approach with annotation projection might yield models that attain higher performance while capturing change in formality over time.","More broadly, a number of recent papers have proposed to detect various types of social relationships from linguistic content. Of particular interest are power relationships, which can be induced from n-gram features (Bramsen et al., 2011; Prabhakaran et al., 2012) and from coordination, where one participant’s linguistic style is asymmetrically affected by the other (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012). Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2013) describe an approach to recognizing politeness in text, lexical and syntactic features motivated by politeness theory. Anand et al. (2011) detect “rebuttals” in argumentative dialogues, and Hasan and Ng (2013) employ extra-linguistic structural features to improve the detection of stances in such debates. In all of these cases, labeled data is used to train supervised model; our work shows that social structural regularities are powerful enough to support accurate in-duction of social relationships (and their linguistic correlates) without labeled data."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper represents a step towards unifying theoretical models of signed social network structures with linguistic accounts of the expression of social relationships in dialogue. By fusing these two phenomena into a joint probabilistic model, we can induce edge types with robust linguistic signatures and coherent structural properties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on movie dialogues, where it induces symmetric T/V networks and their linguistic signatures without supervision. Future work should evaluate the capability of this approach to induce asymmetric signed networks, the utility of partial or distant supervision, and applications to non-fictional dialogues."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank the reviewers for their detailed feedback.
