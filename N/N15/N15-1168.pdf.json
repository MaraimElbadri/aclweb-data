We introduce the task of categorizing information about medication use to determine whether a doctor has prescribed medication, changed protocols, observed effects, or stopped use of a medication. First, we create a medication detector for informal veterinary texts and show that features derived from the Web can be very powerful. Second, we create classifiers to categorize each medication mention with respect to six categories. We demonstrate that this task benefits from a rich linguistic feature set, domain-specific semantic features produced by a weakly supervised semantic tagger, and balanced self-training."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Natural language processing holds great promise for automatically extracting empirical data about medications, from the perspective of both doctors and patients. A wealth of information about the administration and effectiveness of medications lies within unstructured text, including medical records created by health care professionals (e.g., discharge summaries) as well as informal texts written by medical practitioners and patients (e.g., Web forums).","Previous work has been done on detecting medication terms and recognizing relations between medications and other medical concepts, such as diseases and symptoms. Our research explores a new problem: identifying and categorizing contexts in-volving the administration of medications, which we call medication use categorization. For each mentioned medication, we want to know whether it was used in a patient’s care, and if so, what actions or ob-","servations are being reported. Our task aims to distinguish between contexts where a doctor prescribed a medication, changed the protocol of a medication (e.g., dosage or frequency), stopped use of a medication, observed effects produced by the medication, or is asking a question about a medication. Distinguishing these contexts is an important step toward being able to extract empirical data about medication use, such as effectiveness, success under different protocols, and adverse events.","Our research studies veterinary discussion forums, which often contain informal vocabulary such as shortened and abbreviated medication terms (e.g. “pred” instead of “prednisone”, or “abx” for “an-tibiotics”). The first part of our research addresses the problem of medication detection from informal text. We create an effective medication detector using supervised learning with linguistic features as well as contextual features acquired from the Web. We show that the Web context features substantially improve recall, and yield an effective medication detector even with small amounts of training data.","Second, we design supervised classifiers for medication use categorization. We incorporate a rich set of contextual, syntactic, and sentential features as well as a semantic tagger trained for the veterinary domain with bootstrapped learning over a large set of unannotated veterinary texts. We demonstrate additional performance gains by using balanced self-training with the unannotated texts."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Previous work on extracting medication information from text has primarily focused on clinical medical text, such as discharge summaries (e.g., (Doan and Xu, 2010; Halgrim et al., 2010; Doan et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2013; Segura-Bedmar et al.,","1452","2013)). The Third and Fourth i2b2 Shared Tasks included medication detection from clinical texts (Uzuner et al., 2010; Uzuner et al., 2011), and the Fourth i2b2 Shared Task also included relation classification between treatments (including medications), problems, and tests. Recently, there has been growing interest in extracting medication information from other types of text, such as Twitter, online health forums, and drug review sites (e.g., (Leaman et al., 2010; Bian et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013; Liu and Chen, 2013; Yates and Goharian, 2013; Segura-Bedmar et al., 2014)). Much of this research is geared toward identifying adverse drug events or drug-drug interactions.","Many methods have been used for medication extraction, including rule based approaches (Levin et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2010), machine learning (Patrick and Li, 2010; Doan and Xu, 2010; Tang et al., 2013), and hybrid methods (Halgrim et al., 2010; Meystre et al., 2010). Rule based and hybrid approaches typically rely on manually created lexicons and rules. RxNorm (Nelson et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2005) is a large knowledge base containing generic and brand names of drugs and it is often used as a component in these systems. We compare our results with the MedEx system (Xu et al., 2010), which uses RxNorm coupled with manually defined rules.","To our knowledge, classifying medication mentions with respect to administration use categories has not yet been studied. A novel aspect of our work is also the use of Web Context features for medication detection. Similar Web features have been exploited for fine-grained person classification (Giuliano, 2009), while we demonstrate that they can be highly beneficial for medical concept extraction."]},{"title":"3 Task Description and Data Set","paragraphs":["We divide our task into two subproblems: (1) Medication Detection aims to identify words corresponding to non-food substances used to treat patients (e.g., drugs, potassium supplements), and (2) Medication Use Categorization aims to classify medication mentions based on actions and observa-tions related to their administration and to identify question contexts. We assign each medication mention to one of the six categories below.","Rx: The text indicates that a doctor prescribed the medication for a patient, or that a patient is taking (or has previously taken) the medication. Example: “ I started the dog on abx.” Change: A change in the administration of the medication was made (e.g., dosage, route, frequency). Example: “ I increased the pred to 5mg.” Stop: Use of the medication was discontinued. Example: “ We took the cat off metacam.” Effect: The text reports a positive or negative effect from the medication on a patient. Example: “ The dog responded well to Vetsulin.” Question: A question is asked about the medication. Example: “ Do you think we should consider lasix?” Other: None of the above. This category primarily covers contexts not describing patient use. Example: “ Aranesp is expensive.”","Our data consists of discussion forums from the Veterinary Information Network (VIN), which is a web portal (www.vin.com) that hosts message boards for veterinary professionals to discuss cases and issues in their practice. To produce gold standard annotations, we collected the initial post of 500 randomly selected threads from VIN forums about cardiology/pulmonology, endocrinology, and feline internal medicine. We defined annotation guidelines to identify the minimum span of medication mentions.1 Two people independently annotated 50 texts, and we measured their inter-annotator agreement (IAA) using Cohen’s kappa (κ) statistic. For medication detection, their IAA score was κ = .96.","For the medication use categories, we measured IAA in two ways. First, we measured agreement on all of the words labeled as a medication by at least one annotator, yielding κ = 0.80. Second, we measured agreement only on the words labeled as a medication by both annotators (to more directly assess agreement on the six categories), yielding κ = .92. Finally, the annotators labeled an additional 450 texts, producing a gold standard set of 500 labeled texts. Of the annotated medication mentions, 93% have one word and 6% have two words. The frequency of each category is shown below.","Rx Question Effect Change Stop Other 908 289 181 52 53 470","1Dosage and duration terms were not included.","1453"]},{"title":"4 Medication Detection","paragraphs":["Detecting medication terms in discussion forums is challenging because of their informal nature. As we will show in Section 4.1, dictionary look-up from lexicons is not sufficient. Therefore the first part of our research aims to create an effective medication detector for these informal veterinary texts. We used the Stanford CoreNLP tools (Manning et al., 2014) for lemmatization, POS tagging and parsing, and created a SVM classifier with a linear kernel using SVMlin (Sindhwani and Keerthi, 2006). The classifier labels each token as a medication term or not a medication term. Adjacent medication tokens are then combined into a single medication mention. We designed three types of features:","Word Features include the medication word’s string, lemma, and part-of-speech tag. Since drugs often have common affixes (e.g.,“-sone” is a common suffix for corticosteroids), we also defined features for character sequences of length 2-4 at the be-ginning and end of a word.","Local Context Features represent the word preceding and the word following each medication term. We replace numbers with the symbol “CD”. We also defined features to represent the syntactic dependency relations linked to the medication word using the Stanford Parser (De Marneffe et al., 2006).","Web Context Features capture information from web sites that mention a term, which provides external context beyond the information available in the training texts. During training, we issued a Google query for each unique word in our training data and collected the title and text snippets of the top 10 retrieved documents. We then defined binary-valued features to represent all of the words in the retrieved texts.2 We store the results of each query so that additional queries are needed only for previously unseen words.","4.1 Medication Detection Results","We conducted 10-fold cross-validation experiments on our data set to evaluate our medication detector.","First, we created three baselines to assess the diffi- culty of medication detection for this data.

The VIN thesaurus achieved high precision but only 51% recall. Some reasons for the low coverage include abbreviations, misspellings, general terms (e.g., “drug”), and pronouns that refer to medications (which are annotated in our data). The second row shows the results of MedEx (Xu et al., 2010), which uses the RxNorm drug lexicon and ranked in second place for the 2009 i2b2 Medication Extraction challenge. MedEx’s low precision is primarily due to labeling chemical substances (e.g., “glucose”) as medications, but in our data they are often test results (e.g., “the cat’s glucose level...”). The third row shows the results of creating a Training Lexicon by collect-ing all nouns annotated as medications in the training data. We labeled all instances of these nouns as medication terms in the test data, which produced slightly higher recall and precision than MedEx.","Method Precision Recall F VIN thesaurus 90.9 51.3 65.6 MedEX 52.5 73.8 61.4 Training Lexicon 59.4 76.9 67.0","SVM Classifier Word Features 88.2 79.9 83.9 + Local Context 89.7 81.2 85.3 + Web Context 89.2 86.1 87.6","Table 1: Medication Detection Results","The last three rows in Table 1 show the results for our classifier. With only Word Features, the classifier produced an 83.9% F score, outperforming the baselines. Adding the Local Context Features yielded small gains in recall and precision. The Web Context Features further increased recall from 81% to 86%, raising the F score to 87.6%. We tried adding features for the VIN thesaurus and MedEx system, but they did not improve upon the results obtained with the Web Context features.","We observed that the Web Context Features can compensate for small amounts of training data.

We also used a balanced self-training method on unannotated veterinary texts to further improve performance.","First, we created a one-vs-the-rest binary SVM classifier for each category using scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011).4 If an instance is labeled with multiple categories, we select the most confident one using the distance from the hyperplane. We designed three sets of features. N-gram Features represent a context window of size eight (+/-4) around the medication mention. We define features for lexical unigrams, lexical bigrams, lemma unigrams, and lemma bigrams. Syntactic Features capture verb phrases that participate in a dependency relation with the medication, using the Stanford parser. The","4Note that for medication detection we used SVMlin, but we switched to scikit-learn for the medication categorization because it supported additional types of classifiers that we wanted to try. Ultimately, however, the SVM performed best. We con- firmed that SVM results from both toolkits were very similar.","third set of Sentential Features are for the Question and Other categories to recognize sentences that do not describe use of the medication on a patient, but ask questions, request guidance, describe hypothetical scenarios, etc. The sentential features consist of clause initial part-of-speech (POS) and lemma bigrams; whether the sentence ends with a question mark; whether the word “question” occurs in the same NP as the medication; whether the sentence contains the POS sequence <MD PRP>5; and whether the medication is separated by a comma from the ending question mark (for lists).","Semantic Tagging. We hypothesized that identifying semantic concepts might be beneficial. For example, the presence of an ANIMAL term suggests a patient, and a SYMPTOM term may indicate the reason for a prescription or an effect of medication use. First, we used WordNet (Miller, 1995) and identi- fied synsets for 4 semantic classes: ANIMAL, DRUG, DISEASE/SYMPTOM, and HUMAN. We assigned any noun phrase with a head in these synsets to the corresponding semantic type. Next, we used a bootstrapping method (Huang and Riloff, 2010) to build domain-specific semantic taggers (SemTaggers) for the same four semantic classes as well as TEST, TREATMENT and OTHER. We used 10 seed words6 for each category and 10,000 unlabeled veterinary forum texts for bootstrapping. Finally, we created Semantic Features for our medication use classifier. Each noun phrase tagged with a semantic class was replaced by a semantic type. Then we constructed features from pairs of adjacent terms in a context window of size eight (+/-4) around each medication mention. For example, the word sequence “for a Boston terrier with diabetes” would be transformed into “for ANIMAL with DISSYM” and the features for this context would be: <for ANIMAL>, <ANIMAL with>, and <with DISSYM>.","5.1 Medication Use Categorization Results","Table 2 shows the results for medication use classification, applied to the mentions identified by our medication detector (from Section 4). The N-gram","5For question phrases such as “would he”.","6We used the same seeds as (Huang and Riloff, 2010). However we added one semantic class, TREATMENT, so for this category we manually identified the 10 most frequent words in the unannotated texts that describe treatments.","1455","Method","Rx Question Effect Change Stop Other Average","P R F P R F P R F P R F P R F P R F P R F N-grams 69 74 71 75 65 69 69 37 48 76 44 56 45 23 31 50 54 52 64.0 49.6 55.9 +Sentential 68 73 71 79 71 75 74 41 53 85 45 59 49 32 38 51 54 53 67.8 52.7 59.3 +Syntactic 69 72 71 78 70 74 70 40 51 77 47 59 70 49 58 51 56 53 69.3 55.7 61.8 All+WordNet 69 73 71 80 70 74 73 43 54 86 49 63 72 39 54 50 54 52 71.7 54.6 62.0 All+SemTaggers 69 74 71 80 70 75 78 42 55 87 51 64 73 51 60 53 55 54 73.2 57.2 64.2 w/Balanced Self-Training 71 73 72 81 69 75 69 49 57 76 64 70 67 69 68 55 56 56 70.0 63.5 66.6","Table 2: Medication Use Categorization Results on detected medications (each cell shows Precision, Recall, F)","Method","Rx Question Effect Change Stop Other Average","P R F P R F P R F P R F P R F P R F P R F N-grams 75 85 80 84 82 83 70 40 51 77 44 56 46 24 32 62 65 63 69.1 56.6 62.3 +Sentential 75 83 79 89 88 89 70 45 55 86 45 59 52 38 44 61 64 63 72.4 60.4 65.9 +Syntactic 76 82 79 88 87 88 70 44 54 77 57 59 80 55 65 61 65 63 75.4 63.4 68.9 All+WordNet 75 83 79 89 86 88 75 46 57 81 54 65 82 45 58 60 64 62 77.2 63.1 69.4 All+SemTaggers 76 85 80 90 87 88 79 47 59 89 56 68 81 57 67 65 65 65 79.8 65.9 72.2 w/Balanced Self-Training 78 80 79 90 86 88 75 54 63 76 71 74 78 80 79 66 65 65 77.2 73.2 75.1","Table 3: Medication Use Categorization Results on gold medications (each cell shows Precision, Recall, and F)","features alone yield an average F score of 55.9%.

We then explored a balanced self-training method that enforces an even distribution of the six categories in the new training instances. For this approach, we added exactly k new instances7 for each class, where k was selected to be the size of the smallest set of newly labeled instances among the six categories.
