However, current state-of-the-art relation extraction systems are available only for English because of their heavy reliance on linguistic tools such as part-of-speech taggers and dependency parsers. We present a cross-lingual annotation projection method for language independent relation extraction. We evaluate our method on a manually annotated test set and present results on three typologically different languages. We release these manual annotations and extracted relations in ten languages from Wikipedia."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Relation extraction (RE) is the task of assigning a semantic relationship between a pair of arguments. The two major types of RE are closed domain and open domain RE. While closed-domain RE systems (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Bunescu, 2007; Mintz et al., 2009; Yao and Van Durme, 2014; Berant and Liang, 2014) consider only a closed set of re-lationships between two arguments, open domain systems (Yates et al., 2007; Carlson et al., 2010; Fader et al., 2011; Mausam et al., 2012) use an arbitrary phrase to specify a relationship. In this paper, we focus on open-domain RE for multiple languages. Although there are advantages to closed domain RE (Banko and Etzioni, 2008), it is expensive to construct a closed set of relation types which would be meaningful across multiple languages.","Open RE systems extract patterns from sentences in a given language to identify relations. For learn-","ing these patterns, the sentences are analyzed using a part of speech tagger, a dependency parser and possibly a named-entity recognizer. In languages other than English, these tools are either unavailable or not accurate enough to be used. In comparison, it is easier to obtain parallel bilingual corpora which can be used to build machine translation systems (Resnik and Smith, 2003; Smith et al., 2013).","In this paper, we present a system that performs RE on a sentence in a source language by first translating the sentence to English, performing RE in English, and finally projecting the relation phrase back to the source language sentence. Our system as-sumes the availability of a machine translation system from a source language to English and an open RE system in English but no any other analysis tool in the source language. The main contributions of this work are:","• A pipeline to develop relation extraction system for any source language.","• Extracted open relations in ten languages based on Wikipedia corpus.","• Manual judgements for the projected relations in three languages.","We first describe our methodology for language independent cross-lingual projection of extracted relations (§2) followed by the relation annotation procedure and the results (§3). The manually annotated relations in 3 languages and the automatically extracted relations in 10 languages are available at: http://cs.cmu.edu/m̃faruqui/ soft.html.","1351","Figure 1: RE in a Spanish sentence using the cross-lingual relation extraction pipeline."]},{"title":"2 Multilingual Relation Extraction","paragraphs":["Our method of RE for a sentence s = ⟨s1, s2, . . . sN ⟩ in a non-English language consists of three steps: (1) Translation of s into English, that generates a sentence t = ⟨t1, t2, . . . tM ⟩ with word alignments a relative to s, (2) Open RE on t, and (3) Relation projection from t to s. Figure 1 shows an example of RE in Spanish using our proposed pipeline. We employ OLLIE1 (Mausam et al., 2012) for RE in English and GOOGLE TRANSLATE2 API for translation from the source language to English, although in principle, we could use any translation system to translate the language to English. We next describe each of these components.","2.1 Relation Extraction in English","Suppose t = ⟨t1, t2, . . . , tM ⟩ is a tokenized English sentence. Open relation extraction computes triples of non-overlapping phrases (arg1; rel; arg2) from the sentence t. The two arguments arg1 and arg2 are connected by the relation phrase rel.","We utilized OLLIE (Mausam et al., 2012) to extract the relation tuples for every English sentence. We chose OLLIE because it has been shown to give a higher yield at comparable precision relative to other open RE systems such as REVERB and WOEparse (Mausam et al., 2012). OLLIE was trained by extracting dependency path patterns on annotated training data. This training data was bootstrapped from a set of high precision seed tuples extracted from a simpler RE system REVERB (Fader et al., 2011).

Given a source sentence, the GOOGLE TRANSLATE API provides us its translation along with the word-to-word alignments relative to the source. If s = sN","1 and t = tM","1 denote the source and its English translation, then the alignment a = {aij : 1 ≤ i ≤ N ; 1 ≤ j ≤ M } where, aij = 1 if si is aligned to tj, and is 0 otherwise. A","3Example borrowed from Mausam et al. (2012)","4For sentences where the veracity of a relation depends on a clause, OLLIE also outputs the clause. For example, in Early astronomers believed that Earth is the center of the universe, the relation (Earth; be center of; universe) is supplemented by an (AttributedTo: believe; Early astronomers) clause. We ignore this clausal information.","1352","naive word-alignment based projection would map every word from a phrase extracted in English to the source sentence. This algorithm has two drawbacks: first, since the word alignments are many-to-many, each English word can be possibly mapped to more than one source word which leads to ambiguity in its projection; second, a word level mapping can produce non-contiguous phrases in the source sentence, which are hard to interpret semantically.","To tackle these problems, we introduce a novel algorithm that incorporates a BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) based phrase similarity metric to perform cross-lingual projection of relations. Given a source sentence, its translation, and the word-to-word alignment, we first extract phrase-pairs P using the phrase-extract algorithm (Och and Ney, 2004). In each extracted phrase pair (phrs, phrt) ∈ P , phrs and phrt are contiguous word sequences in s and t respectively. We next determine the translations of arg1, rel and arg2 from the extracted phrase-pairs.","For each English phrase p ∈ {arg1, rel, arg2}, we first obtain the phrase-pair (phrs, phrt) ∈ P such that phrt has the highest BLEU score relative to p subject to the condition that p ∩ phrt ̸= ∅ i.e, there is at least one word overlap between the two phrases. This condition is necessary since we use BLEU score with smoothing and may obtain a nonzero BLEU score even with zero word overlap. If there are multiple phrase-pairs in P that correspond to the same target phrase phrt, we select the shortest source phrase (phrs). However, if there is no word overlap between the target phrase p and any of the target phrases in P , we project the phrase using the word-alignment based projection. The cross-lingual projection method is presented in Algorithm 1."]},{"title":"3 Experiments","paragraphs":["Evaluation for open relations is a difficult task with no standard evaluation datasets. We first describe the construction of our multilingual relation extraction dataset and then present the experiments.","Annotation. The current approach to evaluation for open relations (Fader et al., 2011; Mausam et al., 2012) is to extract relations from a sentence and manually annotate each relation as either valid (1) or invalid (0) for the sentence. For exam-","ple, in the sentence: “Michelle Obama, wife of Barack Obama was born in Chicago”, the follow-ing are possible annotations: a) (Michelle Obama; born in; Chicago): 1, b) (Barack Obama; born in; Chicago): 0. Such binary annotations are not available for languages apart from English. Furthermore, a binary 1/0 label is a coarse annotation that could unfairly penalize an extracted relation which has the correct semantics but is slightly ungrammatical. This could occur either when prepositions are dropped from the relation phrase or when there is an ambiguity in the boundary of the relation phrase.","Therefore to evaluate our multilingual relation extraction framework, we obtained annotations from professional linguists for three typologically different languages: French, Hindi, and Russian. The annotation task is as follows: Given a sentence and a pair of arguments (extracted automatically from the sentence), the annotator identifies the most relevant contiguous relation phrase from the sentence that establishes a plausible connection between the two arguments. If there is no meaningful contiguous relation phrase between the two arguments, the arguments are considered invalid and hence, the extracted relation tuple from the sentence is considered incorrect.","Given the human annotated relation phrase and the automatically extracted relation phrase, we can measure the similarity between the two, thus alleviating the problem of coarse annotation in binary judgments. For evaluation, we first report the percentage of valid arguments. Then for sentences with valid arguments, we use smoothed sentence-level BLEU score (max n-gram order = 3) to measure the similarity of the automatically extracted relation relative to the human annotated relation.5","Results. We extracted relations from the entire Wikipedia6 corpus in Russian, French and Hindi from all sentences whose lengths are in the range of 10 − 30 words. We randomly selected 1, 000 relations for each of these languages and annotated them. The results are shown in table 1. The percentage of valid extractions is highest in French (81.6%)","5We obtained two annotations for ≈ 300 Russian sentences.","Between the two annotations, the perfect agreement rate was","74.5% and the average BLEU score was 0.85.","6www.wikipedia.org","1353","Language Argument 1 Relation phrase Argument 2","French","Il fut enrôlé de force au RAD He was conscripted to RAD","Hindi","bahut se log aaye cailifornia Many people came to California","Russian","Автокатастрофа произошла Черногории Crash occured Montenegro","Table 3: Examples of extracted relations in different languages with English translations (Hindi is transliterated).","Language % valid BLEU","Relation length","Gold Auto French 81.6% 0.47 3.6 2.5 Hindi 64.9% 0.38 4.1 2.8 Russian 63.5% 0.62 1.8 1.7","Table 1: % of valid relations and BLEU score of the extracted relations across languages with the average relation phrase length (in words).","[0-0.1) [0.1-0.2) [0.2-0.4) [0.4-0.6) [0.6-0.8) [0.8-1) [1] Binned BLEU Score","0","50","100","150","200","250","300","350","400","Number of Relations","French Hindi Russian","Figure 2: Number of automatically extracted relations binned by their BLEU scores computed relative to the manually annotated relations.","followed by Hindi and Russian (64.0%). Surprisingly, Russian obtains the lowest percentage of valid relations but has the highest BLEU score between the automatic and the human extracted relations. This could be attributed to the fact that the average relation length (in number of words) is the shortest for Russian. From table 1, we observe that the length of the relation phrase is inversely correlated with the BLEU score.","Figure 2 shows the distribution of the number of extracted relations across bins of similar BLEU scores.

This is an encouraging result since it implies that the majority of the extracted relation phrases are identical to the manually annotated relations.

There has been a grow-ing interest in RE for languages other than English. Gamallo et al. (2012) present a dependency-parser based open RE system for Spanish, Portuguese and Galician. RE systems for Korean have been developed for both open-domain (Kim et al., 2011) and closed-domain (Kim and Lee, 2012; Kim et al., 2014) using annotation projection.
