This year we held a joint call for tutorials for NAACL, ACL and EMNLP. We received a total of 32 proposals that were reviewed by the six tutorial co-chairs. After careful deliberation six tutorials were accepted to be presented at NAACL.","We are grateful to Rada Mihalcea, NAACL general chair, Peter Ljunglof, NAACL website chair, Saif M. Mohammad, NAACL publicity chair, Matt Post, NAACL publications chair, and Priscilla Rasmussen, local arrangement chair for their help during the whole process. We also want to extend our sincere gratitude to the other tutorial chairs: Eneko Agirre, Kevin Duh, Maggie Li, and Khalil Sima’an. Last, but not least, we thank the tutorial presenters for their effort in developing these great tutorials.","We hope you enjoy the tutorial program!","NAACL 2015 Tutorial co-chairs Yang Liu Thamar Solorio","iii","Tutorial Co-chairs:","Yang Liu, The University of Texas at Dallas Thamar Solorio, University of Houston","v"]},{"title":"Table of Contents","paragraphs":["Hands-on Learning to Search for Structured Prediction Hal Daumé III, John Langford, Kai-Wei Chang, He He and Sudha Rao . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1","Crowdsourcing for NLP Chris Callison-Burch, Lyle Ungar and Ellie Pavlick . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2","The Logic of AMR: Practical, Unified, Graph-Based Sentence Semantics for NLP Nathan Schneider, Jeffrey Flanigan and Tim O’Gorman . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4","Deep Learning and Continuous Representations for Natural Language Processing Wen-tau Yih, Xiaodong He and Jianfeng Gao . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6","Social Media Predictive Analytics Svitlana Volkova, Benjamin Van Durme, David Yarowsky and Yoram Bachrach . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9","Getting the Roles Right: Using FrameNet in NLP Collin Baker, Nathan Schneider, Miriam R L Petruck and Michael Ellsworth . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10","vii"]},{"title":"Conference Program","paragraphs":["Sunday, May 31","Morning Session","09:00–12:30 Hands-on Learning to Search for Structured Prediction Hal Daumé III, John Langford, Kai-Wei Chang, He He and Sudha Rao","09:00–12:30 Crowdsourcing for NLP Chris Callison-Burch, Lyle Ungar and Ellie Pavlick","09:00–12:30 The Logic of AMR: Practical, Unified, Graph-Based Sentence Semantics for NLP Nathan Schneider, Jeffrey Flanigan and Tim O’Gorman","Afternoon Session","14:00–17:30 Deep Learning and Continuous Representations for Natural Language Processing Wen-tau Yih, Xiaodong He and Jianfeng Gao","14:00–17:30 Social Media Predictive Analytics Svitlana Volkova, Benjamin Van Durme, David Yarowsky and Yoram Bachrach","14:00–17:30 Getting the Roles Right: Using FrameNet in NLP Collin Baker, Nathan Schneider, Miriam R L Petruck and Michael Ellsworth","ix"]}]}
