However, the vast quantities of conversational exchanges now available on social media websites such as Twitter and Reddit raise the prospect of building data-driven models that can begin to communicate conversationally. The work of Ritter et al. (2011), for example, demonstrates that a response generation system can be constructed from Twitter conversations using statistical machine translation techniques, where a status post by a Twitter user is “translated” into a plausible looking response.","However, an approach such as that presented in Ritter et al.

Broadly speaking, context may be linguistic or involve grounding in the physical or virtual world, but we here focus on linguistic context. The ability to take into account previous utterances is key to building dialog systems that can keep conversations active and engaging. Figure 1 illustrates a typical Twitter dialog where the contextual information is crucial: the phrase “good luck” is plainly motivated by the reference to “your game” in the first utterance. In the MT model, such contextual sensitivity is difficult to capture; moreover, naive injection of context information would entail unmanageable growth of the phrase table at the cost of increased sparsity, and skew towards rarely-seen context pairs. In most statistical approaches to machine translation, phrase pairs do not share statistical weights regard-less of their intrinsic semantic commonality.","We propose to address the challenge of context-sensitive response generation by using continuous representations or embeddings of words and phrases to compactly encode semantic and syntactic similarity. We argue that embedding-based models af-","196","ford flexibility to model the transitions between consecutive utterances and to capture long-span dependencies in a domain where traditional word and phrase alignment is difficult (Ritter et al., 2011). To this end, we present two simple, context-sensitive response-generation models utilizing the Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RLM) architecture of (Mikolov et al., 2010). These models first encode past information in a hidden continuous representation, which is then decoded by the RLM to promote plausible responses that are simultaneously fluent and contextually relevant. Unlike typical complex task-oriented multi-modular dialog systems (Young, 2002; Stent and Bangalore, 2014), our architecture is completely data-driven and can easily be trained end-to-end using unstructured data without requiring human annotation, scripting, or automatic parsing.","This paper makes the following contributions. We present a neural network architecture for response generation that is both context-sensitive and data-driven. As such, it can be trained from end to end on massive amounts of social media data. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a neural-network model to open-domain response generation, and we believe that the present work will lay groundwork for more complex models to come. We additionally in-troduce a novel multi-reference extraction technique that shows promise for automated evaluation."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Our work naturally lies in the path opened by Ritter et al. (2011), but we generalize their approach by exploiting information from a larger context. Ritter et al. and our work represent a radical paradigm shift from other work in dialog. More traditional dialog systems typically tease apart dialog management (Young, 2002) from response generation (Stent and Bangalore, 2014), while our holistic approach can be considered a first attempt to accomplish both tasks jointly. While there are previous uses of machine learning for response generation (Walker et al., 2003), dialog state tracking (Young et al., 2010), and user modeling (Georgila et al., 2006), many components of typical dialog systems remain hand-coded: in particular, the labels and attributes defining dialog states. In contrast, the dialog state in our neural network model is completely latent and directly optimized towards end-to-end performance. In this sense,","we believe the framework of this paper is a significant milestone towards more data-driven and less hand-coded dialog processing.","Continuous representations of words and phrases estimated by neural network models have been applied on a variety of tasks ranging from Information Retrieval (IR) (Huang et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2014), Online Recommendation (Gao et al., 2014b), Machine Translation (MT) (Auli et al., 2013; Cho et al., 2014; Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014), and Language Modeling (LM) (Bengio et al., 2003; Collobert and Weston, 2008). Gao et al. (2014a) successfully use an embedding model to refine the estimation of rare phrase-translation probabilities, which is traditionally affected by sparsity problems. Robustness to sparsity is a crucial property of our method, as it allows us to capture context information while avoiding unmanageable growth of model parameters.","Our work extends the Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RLM) of (Mikolov et al., 2010), which uses continuous representations to estimate a probability function over natural language sentences. We propose a set of conditional RLMs where contextual information (i.e., past utterances) is encoded in a continuous context vector to help generate the response. Our models differ from most previous work in the way the context vector is constructed. For example, Mikolov and Zweig (2012) and Auli et al. (2013) use a pre-trained topic model. In our models, the context vector is learned along with the conditional RLM that generates the response. Additionally, the learned context encodings do not exclusively capture contentful words. Indeed, even “stop words” can carry discriminative power in this task; for example, all words in the utterance “how are you?” are commonly characterized as stop words, yet this is a contentful dialog utterance."]},{"title":"3 Recurrent Language Model","paragraphs":["We give a brief overview of the Recurrent Language Model (RLM) (Mikolov et al., 2010) architecture that our models extend.

Hence, our dataset is composed of “triples” τ ≡ (cτ , mτ , rτ ) consisting of three sentences. We mined 127M context-message-response triples from the Twitter FireHose, covering the 3-month period June 2012 through August 2012.","199","Corpus # Triples Avg # Ref [Min,Max] # Ref","Tuning 2118 3.22 [1, 10] Test 2114 3.58 [1, 10]","Table 1: Number of triples, average, minimum and maximum number of references for tuning and test corpora.","Only those triples where context and response were generated by the same user were extracted. To minimize noise, we selected triples that contained at least one frequent bigram that appeared more than 3 times in the corpus. This produced a corpus of 29M Twitter triples. Additionally, we hired crowdsourced raters to evaluate approximately 33K candidate triples. Judgments on a 5-point scale were obtained from 3 raters apiece. This yielded a set of 4232 triples with a mean score of 4 or better that was then randomly binned into a tuning set of 2118 triples and a test set of 2114 triples3. The mean length of responses in these sets was approximately 11.5 tokens, after cleanup (e.g., stripping of emoticons), including punctuation.","5.2 Automatic Evaluation","We evaluate all systems using BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), and supplement these results with more targeted human pairwise comparisons in Section 6.3. A major challenge in using these automated metrics for response generation is that the set of reasonable responses in our task is potentially vast and extremely diverse. The dataset construction method just described yields only a single reference for each status. Accordingly, we extend the set of references using an IR approach to mine potential responses, after which we have human judges rate their appropriateness. As we see in Section 6.3, it turns out that by optimizing systems towards BLEU using mined multi-references, BLEU rankings align well with human judgments. This lays groundwork for interesting future correlation studies.","Multi-reference extraction We use the following algorithm to better cover the space of reasonable responses. Given a test triple τ ≡ (cτ , mτ , rτ ), our goal is to mine other responses {rτ̃ } that fit the context and message pair (cτ , mτ ). To this end, we first select a set of 15 candidate triples {τ̃ } using an IR","3The Twitter ids of the tuning and test sets along with the code for the neural network models may be obtained from http://research.microsoft.com/convo/","system. The IR system is calibrated in order to select candidate triples τ̃ for which both the message mτ̃ and the response rτ̃ are similar to the original message mτ and response rτ . Formally, the score of a candidate triple is:","s(τ̃ , τ ) = d(mτ̃ , mτ ) (α d(rτ̃ , rτ ) + (1 − α)ε), (9)","where d is the bag-of-words BM25 similarity function (Robertson et al., 1995), α controls the impact of the similarity between the responses and ε is a smoothing factor that avoids zero scores for candidate responses that do not share any words with the reference response. We found that this simple for-mula provided references that were both diverse and plausible. Given a set of candidate triples {τ̃ }, human evaluators are asked to rate the quality of the response within the new triples {(cτ , mτ , rτ̃ )}. After human evaluation, we retain the references for which the score is 4 or better on a 5 point scale, resulting in 3.58 references per example on average (Table 1). The average lengths for the responses in the multi-reference tuning and test sets are 8.75 and 8.13 tokens respectively.","5.3 Feature Sets","The response generation systems evaluated in this paper are parameterized as log-linear models in a framework typical of statistical machine translation (Och and Ney, 2004). These log-linear models comprise the following feature sets:","MT MT features are derived from a large response generation system built along the lines of Ritter et al. (2011), which is based on a phrase-based MT decoder similar to Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). Our MT feature set includes the following features that are common in Moses: forward and backward maximum likelihood “translation” probabilities, word and phrase penalties, linear distortion, and a modified Kneser-Ney language model (Kneser and Ney, 1995) trained on Twitter responses. For the translation probabilities, we built a very large phrase table of 160.7 million entries by first filtering out Twitterisms (e.g., long sequences of vowels, hashtags), and then selecting candidate phrase pairs using Fisher’s exact test (Ritter et al., 2011).

(2011): For a test triple τ , we choose rτ̃ as the candidate response iff τ̃ = arg maxτ̃ d(mτ , mτ̃ ).","CMM Neither MT nor IR traditionally take into account contextual information. Therefore, we take into consideration context and message matches (CMM), i.e., exact matches between c, m and r. We define 8 features as the [1-4]-gram matches between c and the candidate reply r and the [1-4]-gram matches between m and the candidate reply r. These exact matches help capture and promote contextual information in the replies.","RLMT, DCGM-I, DCGM-II We consider the RLM trained on the concatenated triples, denoted as RLMT (Section 4.1), to be a context-sensitive RLM baseline. Each neural network model contributes an additional feature corresponding to the likelihood of the candidate response given context and message.","5.4 Model Training","The proposed models are trained on a 4M subset of the triple data. The vocabulary consists of the most frequent V = 50K words. In order to speed up training, we use the Noise-Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss, which avoids repeated summations over V by approximating the probability of the target word (Gutmann and Hyvärinen, 2010). Parameter optimization is done using Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) with a mini-batch size of 100 and a learning rate α = 0.1, which we found to work well on held-out data. In order to stabilize learning, we clip the gradients to a fixed range[−10, 10], as suggested in Mikolov et al. (2010). All the parameters of the neural models are sampled from a normal distribution N (0, 0.01) while the recurrent weight Whh is initialized as a","random orthogonal matrix and scaled by 0.01. To prevent over-fitting, we evaluate performance on a held-out set during training and stop when the objective increases. The size of the RLM hidden layer is set to K = 512, where the context encoder is a 512, 256, 512 multilayer network. The bottleneck in the middle compresses context information that leads to similar responses and thus achieves better generaliza-tion. The last layer embeds the context vector into the hidden space of the decoder RLM.","5.5 Rescoring Setup","We evaluate the proposed models by rescoring the n-best candidate responses obtained using the MT phrase-based decoder and the IR system. In contrast to MT, the candidate responses provided by IR have been created by humans and are less affected by fluency issues. The different n-best lists will provide a comprehensive testbed for our experiments. First, we augment the n-best list of the tuning set with the scores of the model of interest. Then, we run an iteration of MERT (Och, 2003) to estimate the log-linear weights of the new features. At test time, we rescore the test n-best list with the new weights."]},{"title":"6 Results 6.1 Lower and Upper Bounds","paragraphs":["Table 2 shows the expected upper and lower bounds for this task as suggested by BLEU scores for human responses and a random response baseline.

Paired responses were presented in random order to the annotators, and each pair of responses was judged by 5 annotators.","Table 4 summarizes the results of human evaluation, giving the difference in mean scores (pairwise preference margin) between systems and 95% confi- dence intervals generated using Welch’s t-test. Identical strings not shown to raters are incorporated with an automatically assigned score of 0.5. The pattern in these results is clear and consistent: context-sensitive systems (+CMM) outperform non-context-sensitive systems, with preference gains as high as approximately 5.3% in the case of DCGM-II+CMM versus IR, and about 3.1% in the case of DCGM-II+CMM versus MT. Similarly, context-sensitive DCGM systems outperform non-DCGM context-sensitive systems by 1.5% (MT) and 2.3% (IR). These results are consistent with the automated BLEU rankings and confirm that our best performing DCGM models outperform both raw baseline and the context-sensitive baseline using CMM features.","6.4 Discussion","Table 5 provides examples of responses generated on the tuning corpus by the MT-based DCGM-II+CMM system, our best system in terms of both BLEU and human evaluation. Responses from this system are on average shorter (8.95 tokens) than the original human responses in the tuning set (11.5 tokens). Overall, the outputs tend to be generic or commonplace, but are often reasonably plausible in the context as in examples 1-3, especially where context and message contain common conversational elements. Example 2 illustrates the impact of context-sensitivity: the word “book” in the response is not found in the message. Nonetheless, longer generated responses are apt to degrade both syntactically and in terms of content. We notice that longer responses are likely to present","203","# Context c Message m Generated Response r","1 noone can help this time its just i need a support system well im here to support you. whenever you need me.","thank you, i appreciate it thank you","2 nothin much, and how’s the book?! its good but i’m only like halfway through cuz i don’t feel like reading. i’m so bored ...","that’s good! i have the book but i’m bored too.","3 i know! what have you been up to? nothing really. just enjoying summer and working. what about you?","that’s good! nothing much just listening to music and you?","4 thanks, your way better though i’m just good at expressing it that’s but trust me you are freakin amazing and waay better","i know, i don’t trust you, i love you too! thank you","5 thanks. yeah i am good thanks! good, but angry! sorry you’re angry, been there, i hope it dies down.","i hope so too, i’m not angry!!","6 figures. bass. never ate bass. bass is extremely mild with very few bones. my favorite after catfish","that’s one of the bones, chuck bass is mine too.","7 today i will walk for miles. clear sky clear mind. love walking. it’s too hot to walk this month. i haven’t moved. frozen. heat freeze.","it’s too hot for you to get up to honey if you have frozen yogurt to you.","8 arresting people over “nasty tweets”? please. i’m not condoning what the lad did but arresting him is a tad silly.","it appears he may have sent death threats to others while all this was kicking off too.","i did! he was armed with nuclear threats? that’s what’s happening to you.","Table 5: Sample responses produced by the MT-based DCGM-II+CMM system.","information that conflicts either internally within the response itself, or is at odds with the context, as in examples 4-5. This is not unsurprising, since our model lacks mechanisms both for reflecting agent intent in the response and for maintaining consistency with respect to sentiment polarity. Longer context and message components may also result in responses that wander off-topic or lapse into incoherence as in 6-8, especially when relatively low frequency unigrams (“bass”, “threat”) are echoed in the response. In general, we expect that larger datasets and incorporation of more extensive contexts into the model will help yield more coherent results in these cases. Consistent representation of agent intent is outside the scope of this work, but will likely remain a significant challenge."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have formulated a neural network architecture for data-driven response generation trained from social media conversations, in which generation of responses is conditioned on past dialog utterances that provide contextual information. We have proposed a novel multi-reference extraction technique allowing for robust automated evaluation using standard SMT metrics such as BLEU and METEOR. Our context-sensitive models consistently outperform both context-independent and context-sensitive baselines by up to 11% relative improvement in","BLEU in the MT setting and 24% in the IR setting, albeit using a minimal number of features. As our models are completely data-driven and self-contained, they hold the potential to improve fluency and contextual relevance in other types of dialog systems.","Our work suggests several directions for future research. We anticipate that there is much room for improvement if we employ more complex neural network models that take into account word order within the message and context utterances. Direct generation from neural network models is an interesting and potentially promising next step. Future progress in this area will also greatly benefit from thorough study of automated evaluation metrics."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank Alan Ritter, Ray Mooney, Chris Quirk, Lucy Vanderwende, Susan Hendrich and Mouni Reddy for helpful discussions, as well as the three anonymous reviewers for their comments."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Michael Auli, Michel Galley, Chris Quirk, and Geoffrey Zweig. 2013.
