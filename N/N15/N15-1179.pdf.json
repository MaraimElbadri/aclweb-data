In this paper, we maintain that a typical product review is not a bag of sentiments, but a narrative with an underlying structure and reoccurring patterns, which allows us to predict its sentiments knowing only its general polarity and discourse cues that occur in it. We hypothesize that knowing only the review’s score and its discourse patterns would allow us to accurately predict the sentiments of its individual sentences. The experiments we conducted prove this hypothesis and show a substantial improvement over the lexical baseline. "]},{"title":"1 Introduction ","paragraphs":["For years, sentiment analysis has heavily relied on lexical resources, whether compiled by hand (Wilson et al., 2005) or automatically extracted from a large corpus (Hu and Lui, 2004). In addition to an overwhelming task of trying to capture all words and expressions that can convey a sentiment there are many other problems to solve: resolving the scope of negation to determine the shift of polarity (Lapponi et al., 2012), determining if an opinion is present in interrogative or conditional sentences (Narayanan et al., 2009), dealing ","with irony (Tsur, 2010), etc. But even if we ","manage to solve all aforementioned problems and ","create an efficient classifier, there will always be ","cases where reliance on lexical cues for ","subjectivity will betray us. Consider, for instance, ","the following examples from reviews of online ","universities1: (1) The lectures are interactive and recorded. ","So, if you can't attend you can listen in ","later. (2) I assure you, online learning at Capella was ","the most difficult form of education I have ","undergone! (3) UMUC provided really good quality educa-","tion until about 5 years ago. "," In the first example, the author expresses a positive opinion of the university, but it will fail to be detected because it does not include any explicit sentiment cues (such opinions are referred to as “implicit” by Liu (2012) or as “polar facts” by Toprak et al. (2010)). Because the sentiment (and its presence) of such sentences is highly domaindependent, they cannot be covered by any lexicons or learned in a supervised or a non-supervised way. ","The second example does have a sentiment cue difficult, and judging by it the sentiment should be 1 The examples in this section are taken from Darmstadt Service Review Corpus, available from https://www.ukp.tudarmstadt.de/data/sentiment-analysis/darmstadt-servicereview-corpus (Toprak et al., 2010). The corpus was also used as a development set for extracting features for this study. ","1559","negative. However, in this case the author actually expresses a positive view of an online university, defending it from people who claim that online education is “too easy”. In the third example, the correct sentiment (negative) would again be impossible to determine because of a complicated structure. ","These are just a few examples of what is currently impossible to classify correctly relying on lexical resources. To improve the classification results, there have been attempts to use local discourse information, such as discourse cues and polarity of adjacent sentences, in order to correct some of the misclassified sentences (Somasundaran, 2010). However, though such attempts resulted in some improvements, they also required quite complicated frameworks. ","While such bottom-up approach (starting from lexical polarity and adding supplementary information to improve classification on a phrase and text level) is commonly used in sentiment analysis, we are wondering if it is the only valid one. Provided that we have a reliable external measure of a text’s general polarity (such as a product rating for a product review) and the narrative has a predictable discourse structure, would not it be possible to classify its sentences in a top-down manner, without using any sentiment lexicons? In this paper, we experiment with this approach and compare its results with those of the traditional bottom-up method. ","This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief overview of previous studies related to sentiment analysis of product reviews, while section 3 explains the motivation behind taking an alternative approach. In section 4 we give the details of the experiments, and then in section 5 present their results. Lastly, section 6 summarizes our findings. "]},{"title":"2 Previous Studies ","paragraphs":["Sentiment analysis so far has largely relied on explicit lexical information, either in the form of sentiment dictionaries and lexicons, such as SentiWordNet 2 or Subjectivity lexicon 3 , opinion phrases extracted from a manually-annotated corpus or a dataset compiled in real time using 2 http://sentiwordnet.isti.cnr.it/ (Baccianella et al., 2010) 3 http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/lexicons/subj_lexicon/ (Wilson et al., 2005) ","machine learning with such lexical features as bagof-words features, n-grams, collocations, or more sophisticated lexical patterns (Tang, 2009). As researchers realized the limitations of a purely lexical approach, they tried to augment it by using negation resolution, word meaning disambiguation or hand-crafted rules (Ding, 2008). However, though such efforts improved classification on the sentence level, they were not able to deal with the sentences where an opinion was implicit (i.e. there were no appraisal words or other lexical cues, see example 1 above) or the polarity of the sentiment word was different from the usual one (see example 2 above). To correct such misclassified instances, another level of complexity was added by using discourse features. Somasundaran (2010) defines opinion frames to enforce discourse constraints on the polarity of segments with the same or alternative target relations. Using a similar approach, Zhou et al. (2011) employ simplified Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) relation cues (contrast, condition, continuation, cause and purpose) to eliminate polarity ambiguities. Yang (2014) concentrates on discovering opinionated sentences which do not have strong sentiment signals (implicit opinions), using discourse knowledge to improve the results of a Conditional Random Fields classifier. While such approaches are a definite improvement over the lexical baseline, they are computationally complex and still overly dependent on the lexical cues. ","While machine learning algorithms such as Naïve Bayes or SVM are still the primary tools used for sentiment analysis, lately such texts as product reviews have been recognized as having an internal structure and inter-sentential relations, and thus structural conditional frameworks have been used for their classification. One popular tool is Conditional Random Fields (CRF), which was used, among others, by Zhao (2008) to classify sentiments on a sentence level, by Breck (2007) to identify subjective expressions, and by Li (2010) to summarize product reviews taking their structure into account. "]},{"title":"3 Motivation behind Top-down Approach ","paragraphs":["Though most of the previous studies treat product reviews as a bag of sentences or even words, in fact they are narratives that have a specific structure. While their structure is less rigid and ","1560","predicable than, say, that of research papers, it nevertheless has some recurring patterns which lend themselves to generalization. ","The same principle applies to sentiments appearing in product reviews. The authors of reviews do not simply pile up some random facts about the product or their evaluations of it. To the best of their abilities, they try to convince the reader to buy or not to buy a particular product, and, according to Grice’s Maxims (Grice, 1975), they do it in the clearest and most effective way possible. Thus, if an author has in general a positive opinion of a product, the probability of a negative sentence appearing in a review is lower than that of a positive sentence, and even if a negative sentence is introduced, it is likely to appear together with a concession or a contrast marker, such as although or but, or be modified by a hedging expression, such as might, only, could be, which mitigate the negative effect on the reader. Thus the author makes us understand that his primary opinion of the product is still positive, and uses the discourse relation of contrast to present an opposite opinion. ","Likewise, if an objective sentence appears in a review, it is not a random event, but a tool serving some purpose, such as interacting with a reader by asking questions which do not require an answer (Where do I start?) or supporting one’s view by showing that you have some expertise necessary to provide a valid opinion. While in this paper we cover only objective sentences that are used to provide background information (the discourse relation of background), it is clear that other reasons for usage of objective sentences are present and capable of being formalized. ","The facts mentioned above make us consider a product review as a text which has a primary polarity and optionally includes some segments which have an opposite polarity or no polarity at all (objective sentences). Instead of relying on lexical sentiment information, which makes it difficult to distinguish between objective and subjective sentences on one hand (implicit opinions) and between positive and negative opinions on the other (sarcasm, context-dependent polarity), we suggest using a top-down approach: determining the primary polarity of a review based on an external source of information, such as product rating, and then locating segments which do not conform with this polarity (have no polarity or an ","opposite polarity) by finding cues that mark a change in a discourse flow. ","In the next section we describe an experiment which we conducted to confirm that this approach is viable. "]},{"title":"4 Experiment  4.1 Data and Task ","paragraphs":["For the experiments in this study we use Filatova’s Amazon product reviews corpus (so called Sarcasm Corpus4), consisting of 817 ironic and regular reviews. We chose to use this corpus because we believed that segments in ironic reviews would be difficult to classify by purely lexical means. Out of these 817 reviews we randomly selected 100 reviews for training and 20 reviews for test data. We did not use the whole dataset because the number of reviews with a particular review score differs greatly (60% of reviews are 5-star, while only 5% are 2-star). To prevent a skew towards positive labels we used equal-size random samples of reviews with all possible scores. Reviews were annotated by one of the authors and an external annotator on a clause level if a sentence contained opinions with opposite polarities, and on a sentence level otherwise. The inter-annotator agreement was measured by using Fleiss’ kappa and Krippendorff's alpha, and the results showed that the annotation was highly reliable (κ = 0.912, α = 0.913). Overall the training corpus consisted of 843 segments (438 negative, 268 positive and 137 objective), while the test set contained 145 segments (78 negative, 41 positive and 26 objective). ","While the studies in sentiment analysis usually make distinction between subjective and objective sentences on one hand and between negative, positive and neutral sentences on the other, in this paper we make a twofold distinction, first classifying a segment as objective or subjective, and then, in case of subjective (polar) sentences, further subdividing them into positive and negative. To our mind the classification into positive, negative and neutral sentences, commonly adopted for product reviews, is incorrect, as neutral sentiments rarely, if ever, appear in reviews. What is com-"," 4 http://storm.cis.fordham.edu/~filatova/SarcasmCorpus.html (Filatova, 2012). ","1561","monly referred to as neutral sentences should be ","classified as objective segments, as they do not ","carry any sentiment related to the subject matter. ","When annotating the corpus we considered the ","intended semantic orientation of a segment, not its ","literal meaning and the presence and polarity of ","lexical cues. Thus, segments without any lexical ","cues could be annotated both as subjective and ","objective: "," ","(4) I bought this mobo from Amazon, after ","buying the same month the DG31PR ","Classic for my wife. (objective) "," ","(5) After I install my new PC, the 2do. day of ","use, the LAN failed. (subjective, negative) "," ","Segments with a lexical cue of a certain polarity ","could be annotated both as positive and negative: (6) The ring is nice and heavy. (positive) (7) It's going to be a nice paperweight. (nega-","tive, from a review of a camera) "," ","Finally, segments where an alternative product was ","praised or preferred were understood to be a criti-","cism towards the reviewed product: (8) I will never buy another Panasonic product. ","There are plenty of other brands that are ","loyal to their customers. (both segments are ","negative) "," We view each of the reviews as a separate discourse with its own sentiment flow, and thus treat the sentiment analysis problem as a sequence classification task. We employ the CRF method, which outperforms other methods of sequence labeling (Lafferty, 2001). In CRFs the probability of a sequence is defined as "]},{"title":")( ),(exp )|( XZ XYF XYp","paragraphs":["","","   ","where "]},{"title":" ","paragraphs":["y","xyFxZ ),(exp)(  ","where X is a set of input random variables, Y is a set of labels, and λ is a weight for the feature function F(Y,X). (Sha, 2003). ","All experiments in this paper were conducted using a C++ implementation of a linear Conditional Random Fields classifier (CRF++) 5 . Though more complex or constrained types of CRF classifiers and models based on them proved to be more suitable for sentiment analysis (Mao, 2006; Yang, 2014), we use the simplest model as a proof of concept in this study. ","Each review in the training and test data is converted into a sequence of polarity segments assigned to it. For example, the following short review: "," ","(9) The ring is nice and heavy. Have been wearing if for almost a month and still not a scratch! "," is presented as a sequence of tokens POSITIVE POSITIVE, based on the sentiment labels from the annotation. The tokens are assigned features, as defined in the following sections, which are then fed into the classifier. ","4.2 Features for Experiments "," 4.2.1 Lexical Features To set a baseline, we use a state-of-art lexical classifier – Stanford Sentiment Analysis Classifier from Stanford CoreNLP toolkit6 – to determine the lexical polarity of each individual sentence. Thus the lexical classifier considers only lexical features available in a particular sentence without looking at neighboring sentences or discourse cues. For the local context classifier we also determine the lexical polarity of the previous and next sentences and use the sequence of {prev_polarity, current_polarity, next_polarity} as a feature (a similar approach is taken by Somasundaran (2010)). This is done to disambiguate and, if necessary, to correct the polarity of misclassified instances that are sandwiched between the correctly classified ones. For example, if the lexical classifier fails to detect an implicit opinion "," 5 Available from http://taku910.github.io/crfpp/ 6 Available from http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/code.html ","1562","in a sentence that appears between two explicit opinions, it might correct it as follows: "," ","POSITIVE OBJECTIVE POSITIVE -> ","POSITIVE POSITIVE POSITIVE "," 4.2.2 Contrast Features The main drawback of the local context classifier is that it can misclassify sentences with the opposite polarity, lumping them together with sentences of the primary polarity. To prevent this, for the contrast classifier we add another set of features – discourse cues with a Rhetoric Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) relation of contrast. We consider both explicit and implicit discourse markers of contrast for this set of features: 4.2.2.1 Explicit Contrast Markers "," Contrast relations are primarily realized by using explicit discourse markers, which, depending on their type, mark the sentence they appear in (in case of although type) or the previous sentence (in case of but type) as contrasting: ","(10) The Phillips screwdriver on the end of one of the tines is helpful for things like tightening eyeglasses, POSITIVE CONTR but it is slightly offset from the opposing blade and I've nicked or jabbed myself with it more than once while it's in my pocket. NEGATIVE NCONTR "," ","(11) Although it has 10 workable buttons which come in handy for some games, POSITIVE CONTR it has some major flaws. NEGATIVE NCONTR "," The segment with the NCONTR marker usually has the primary polarity of the review, while the segment with a CONTR marker presents a contrasting opinion. 4.2.2.2 Implicit Contrast Relations Contrast relations can also be manifested implicitly through the use of hedges. Hedging is often used when the review’s author wants to mention some ","negative side of a product they like (or a positive ","aspect of a product they hate), but does not want to ","put an unnecessary emphasis on it. Such hedging ","expressions as the only good/bad point, the only ","drawback, I would only recommend it... etc are ","used for this purpose: (12) With all the upgrades that Apple has done ","with their macbooks, I think I finally feel ","that it's worth the spending to buy my first ","mac. NHEDGE ","My only complain is that it's still a lot more ","expensive than PC laptops with similar ","specs. HEDGE "," ","4.2.3 Background Classifier "," ","The background classifier allows us to capture ","some of the objective sentences that are related to ","the polar ones using a background RST relation. ","We identify three types of patterns where back-","ground relations are used: 1. Acquirement patterns: people often start re-","views with an explanation of how they got ","the product. 2. Personal background patterns: people often ","support their evaluation of a product by ","stating who there are, what they do for a ","living, what kind of lifestyle they lead etc. 3. Personal experience patterns: again, to ","support their views the writers prime their ","readers by describing their experiences or ","achievements. "," Unfortunately, background relations, unlike contrast relations, are almost never explicit. They are paratactic and lack discourse cues, so we need to rely on lexical and grammatical features for classification. However, we believe that because background information is usually presented in easy-topredict patterns, it is more feasible and computationally inexpensive to use lexical cues to single out objective sentences than to try to capture infinitely large number of ways sentiments can be expressed. In the following subsections, we describe these patterns in more detail and explain which lexical and grammatical cues can be used to detect them. ","1563","4.2.3.1 Acquirement Patterns ","At the beginning of a review people often explain how they acquired the product: "," ","(13) I bought this camera for my deployment to Iraq. (objective) It was in my cargo pants pocket one day I took it out and the lens was cracked and the silver trim ring had fallen off. (negative) "," We formalize this feature as follows: ","[I | we] [verb synonymous to “acquire”|verb of decision + verb synonymous to “acquire”], ","or, more specifically: [I | we] [ordered | bought | got .* as a gift | purchased | decided to buy...] "," All verbs are in past simple tense, as only in this tense they are unlikely to bear any sentiment (compare, for example, sentences with the same verbs in present perfect tense: ","(14) However, I am glad that I have bought a mac.(positive) "," ","(15) This is probably the worst book I’ve ","bought. (negative) "," Moreover, this pattern is likely to be used at the beginning of the review, so we add ACQUIRE feature only to those segments which appear in the first 25% of a review. ","4.2.3.2 Personal Background Patterns ","In these patterns, the authors offer their personal information that is relevant to the subject matter of the review and can support their opinion. For instance, in the following review the author refers to his pets as the major reason for buying a particular vacuum cleaner: "," ","(16) I have a cat and a dog, and there is lots of ","shedding hair, all the time. (objective, per-","sonal background) ","When I saw the DC25 Animal, I decided to spend the money hoping that this vacuum would do the job. (objective, acquirement) It has lived up to my wildest dreams, it is wonderfully easy to handle, so easy to maneuver, the 16 lbs make such a difference compared to those very heavy machines I had before, I had no problem carrying it upstairs. (positive) "," We formalize this feature as follows: "," ","[I|we] [am (a|an)|have (a|an)|'m (a|an)|am not (a|an)] "," The indefinite article is used to prevent matching such polar expressions, as I’m very pleased with the quality of this product. Again, such patterns are searched for only at the beginning of a review. ","4.2.3.3 Personal Experience Patterns ","These patterns also serve to provide some back-","ground information about user’s experiences to ","back up his opinion on a product: "," ","(17) Usually I am a huge fan of hats that look like food. (objective, personal background). My meatloaf hat has been a hit for years. (objective, personal experience) When I received my turkey hat I carefully unwrapped the bubble wrap and gazed upon its tan beauty. (positive). "," To capture this pattern we search for verbs in perfect forms (except for the verbs of possession). We exclude verbs in perfect continuous forms, as they are more often used to describe positive or negative results of using a product. Compare, for example: "," ","(18) I have been using it for almost a month ","and my lashes are so long, they touch my ","eyebrows... (positive) "," We also exclude phrases that have “should/could” before “have”, as they often express negative sentiments (Liu, 2014): "," ","1564","(19) Would have been nice if the stilts could accommodate multiple/varying heights. (negative) "," 4.2.4 Primary Polarity Features Lastly, we use reviews’ scores to predict their global semantic orientation (primary polarity). The intuition behind this is that the reviews with a higher score will contain more positive sentences than reviews with a lower score, and thus global polarity information might help us to amend incorrect predictions of a lexical classifier (a similar approach was taken, among others, by (Yang, 2014)). This is supported by the statistics of our corpus: the polarity of sentences in a review in general correlates with its score. Highly positive (5-star) and highly negative (1-star) reviews contain few segments of the opposite polarity, and even reviews with a less extreme score demonstrate a clear preference of one of the polarities (see Table 1). Thus it can be predicted that the classifier using this feature will tend to assign the primary polarity (positive for 4- and 5star reviews, negative for 1-, 2-, and 3-star reviews) unless there is some strong evidence preventing it. Review score Positive Negative Objective 1 0.01 0.85 0.13 2 0.10 0.77 0.12 3 0.22 0.65 0.13 4 0.62 0.23 0.15 5 0.68 0.04 0.27 ","Table 1. Percentage of positive, negative and ","objective sentences in reviews with different product ","ratings "," ","4.3 Bottom-up vs Top-down Approach: Experiment Design ","4.3.1 Bottom-up Approach ","This is a widely-used approach which relies on a lexical polarity classifier to determine the semantic orientation of each segment and then corrects the misclassified segments by employing more general features: discourse features (in our study – contrast and background) and global semantic orientation ","features (called primary polarity features in this paper). The bottom-up approach has become a standard in sentiment analysis, so we believe there is no need to explain it in detail. The main focus of this study is on the top-down approach, which we describe below. ","4.3.2. Top-down Approach "," In this set of experiments, we do not use any lexical information about the presence of sentiments in segments and their types. Instead, we rely on rating scores assigned to the reviews to determine their primary polarity, and then correct the misclassified instances using discourse features. In general, the feature set used for this classifier is the same as for the bottom-up approach. The only important exception is that lexical features are completely omitted. ","We adopt the following process for sentiment classification: "," ","1. All sentences in a review are assigned a polarity label determined by the corresponding review rating. ","2. We look for discourse patterns that are associated with a change of the primary polarity (POSITIVE -> NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE -> POSITIVE). These are usually manifested through contrast relation and enable us to correct some of misclassified polarity labels. ","3. We look for discourse patterns where a polar statement is accompanied by an objective statement. A common example of such discourse relations in product reviews is background. At this stage, unnecessary POSITIVE and NEGATIVE labels are changed into OBJECTIVE. "," Schematically this can be shown as follows using an arbitrary example of a 4-star review, where light-gray blocks stand for positive segments, darkgray for negative segments and white for objective ones (here we assume that all segments will be initialized as positive, as it is the primary class for 4-star reviews): "," ","1565"," ","Figure 1. Top-down approach classification flow "," In the next section, we discuss the results of experiments conducted to show that such features can improve sentiment classification. "]},{"title":"5 Experiment Results ","paragraphs":["In this section, we compare the results achieved by using the top-down approach with those of the traditional bottom-up method. ","5.1 Bottom-up Approach ","The lexical classifier results, used as a baseline in this study, are listed in Table 2 below. As can be seen from the results, the recall and precision of positive and especially objective segments is low, which shows that purely lexical classifier cannot reliably distinguish between objective and subjective sentences and between positive and negative ones. The accuracy of the classifier is also low (0.6138). ","When we add local discourse context, the recall of positive and negative segments improves, as does the overall accuracy (to 0.6758). However, the local discourse classifier completely ignores the objective sentences, assigning polarity to them. The precision of the negative class and overall precision also gets lower, as some positive segments sandwiched between negative ones are assigned a negative label. ","Adding contrast discourse cues does not help to improve this situation, because it leads to overestimation of positive segments and lower accuracy (0.6620). In fact, the contrast classifier performs even worse than the local discourse one. It seems that lexical information introduces too much noise, and building up on such an unreliable basis does not produce expected results. ","The background classifier improves the performance, especially for objective sentences, classifying them with a high precision and at least some recall. It also improves the overall accuracy (to 0.6896). ","However, the most significant improvement is seen after adding the review scores (primary polarity) as features. It helps improve almost all scores, including accuracy, which reaches 0.7241. "," ","5.2 Top-down Approach "," The primary polarity classifier, which uses the review’s rating to predict its overall polarity, has a high recall and an accuracy of 0.7379 (see Table 3). However, it again ignores the objective class, because it is distributed more or less evenly between reviews with different ratings and thus cannot be correlated with a particular review score.

Thus the recall for the positive class is substantially low than for the negative class. ","To single out the segments whose polarity is different from the primary one, we add explicit and implicit contrast features and train the contrast classifier. Contrast features help to raise recall for positive and precision for negative sentences, though, as might be expected, they do not affect the classification of objective segments. However, the overall precision and recall are improved, as well as the overall accuracy (to 0.7517) ","The background classifier allows us to find some of objective sentences. Acquirement, personal background and personal experience patterns turn out to be precise features that also guarantee us at least some recall for objective sentences. Overall precision, recall and F1 scores are improved accordingly, as well as accuracy (to 0.7931). ","As can be seen from comparing these results, even the most primitive rating-based classifier (primary polarity) achieves better recall and accuracy than any of lexical classifiers (even the one with primary polarity features). Moreover, adding discourse features to it consistently improves the results, allowing us to build a highprecision, high-recall sentiment classifier. On the other hand, building up on the lexical classifier does not show such consistent improvements. "]},{"title":"6 Conclusion ","paragraphs":["Until now the sentiment analysis has been primarily done in a bottom-up way, starting with the classification of lexical items, then resolving the polarity of the sentence, then using discourse information to improve the lexical classification. However, lexical classifiers so far produce results ","that are too unreliable to become a basis of a discourse-level classification. We assert that starting from the top by roughly defining a text’s polarity and assigning it to all its segments, and then fine-tuning the classification by “chiseling out” incorrect bits based on reliable discourse relations can be a more productive and effective approach. Our experiments show that such approach can lead to a substantial improvement over lexical baseline at least in texts with a predictable structure and recurring patterns, such as product reviews. Because each of the discourse features we tested led to improvement, we believe that the topdown classifier can be made even more accurate by employing other discourse relations in the form of carefully selected linguistic features.
