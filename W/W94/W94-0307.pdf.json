The goal of this research is to study how the content of instructional texts and their rhetorical structure can be selected automatically. The approach taken starts from a task representation developed by an AI planner, from which a set of semantic carriers, specifying the content of the text, is selected. Then the rhetorical relations that best communicate these semantic carriers are selected. The approach is based on a corpus analysis that determined:","Â• What semantic carriers are found in instructional texts, where they can be found in the task representation and when they are included in the text.","* What rhetorical relations are used to present the semantic carriers and when one is preferred over another.","If these points are not dealt with, an instructional text generator may choose to say everything available in the task representation, and may communicate it using always the same rhetorical strategy. For example, the task of using the one touch record (OTR) feature of a VCR can be represented as in figure 11 . From this task representation, the following unacceptable text may be produced: To use the 0TR feature, set the speed selector to \"SP\", \"SP\" will light up; select channel 4; specify the recording time; emd press the TIMER button within 9 seconds, the TIMER indicator wÂ£11 light up. To set the speed selector to Â°*SP\", press the SP/EP button. The speed will change. To set channel 4, press the channel button. The channel will change. To specify the recording time, press the OTR button 3 times. To press the OTR button 3 times, press it once, PM 10:35; press it a second time, PM 11:05; press it a third time, PM 11:35. A more natural text would be~: The 0TR feature: Set the tape speed selector to \"SP\". \"SP\" will (I) light up. Select channel 4, by pressing the channel button. (2) Press the OTR button 3 times to specify the (3) recording time. When the button is pressed once, PM 10:35. (4) When it is pressed twice, PM 11:05. (5) When it is pressed 3 times, PM 11:35. (6) Press the TIMER button within 9 seconds. The (7) TIMER indicator will light up.","Not all the knowledge of the task representation is introduced in the text. For example, many parent-child relations between operations are left unsaid. In addition, the same type of knowledge is not always presented by the same rhetorical relation. For example the parent-child relation of the operations in sentence (2) is expressed by an enabiement relation rather than a purpose as in sentence (3).","The paper first reviews previous work in instructional text planning.

For the reader to understand/perform the procedure correctly, the instructional text must communicate the plan of the procedure into the text. In AI, planning techniques have been developed to construct such plans automatically. It then becomes natural to consider an AI planner as a preliminary component to an instructional text generator. The output of an AI planner provides a fairly appropriate source for generating instructional texts, as only specific types of information are found in these texts, and most of them can be found or derived from a task representation.","Another important characteristic of instructional texts is that their rhetorical structure is rather stereotyped and use a small set of relations [12, 15]. In addition, these relations correspond very well to those defined in Mann and Thompson's RST [7]. This makes RST an attractive tool for studying this genre.","From these two remarks, the planning of instructional texts is often seen as a two-stage process [8, 1]: a task planning stage, where the plan of the procedure is developed, followed by a text planning stage, where the content of the text is selected from the task representation 3, and the rhetorical status of this knowledge is selected.","3A task representation provides most knowledge found in instructional texts, but a model of the reader and a domain knowledge base are also required.","When a task representation is used as the source of text planning, the resulting text is very much dependent on the representation's structure. However, a task representation is not universal; several factors can influence its development. The lexical capacity of the language being used may influence the conceptual representation of the task. Also, independently of the language being used, the same task can be represented in various ways (whether with more or less detail, or with a different structure). However, whether we use one representation or another as the basis for generation, the goal of our research is to generate a text similar to \"natural\" ones so that readers can interpret and possibly execute the procedure correctly. Even when human writers wl and w2 write \"natural\" instructions for readers rl and r2, they may base their writ-ing on different task representations and may choose to transmit different information. When reading the texts, rl and r2 may build different task representations from one another and from wl and w2. But if both texts are adequate, the readers will interpret the prescribed task correctly. No single ideal task representation exists for a procedure and no single ideal text describing it exists. Our goal is not to construct and use the one task representation that allows the generation system to reproduce the source text word for word, but to produce \"possibly natural\" texts from a \"possibly natural\" task representation."]},{"title":"2.1 AI Planning","paragraphs":["An AI planner, or task planner, attempts to find a set of operations to achieve some task, or goal [13].

Â±n_vcr(cassette)); if the task planner cannot solve a precondition, the condition is passed on to the text planner to be included in the text and solved by the agent, (4) and its postconditions: states that become true or false after the operation is executed. Postconditions can be divided into: postconditions of success (if the operation is performed correctly, eg. on(timer.light)) and postconditions of failure (if the operation is not performed correctly, eg. blink (error_light)).","Note that we consider operations to be events whose actor is the agent performing the procedure, and could occur now or in the near future. Events whose actor is the device being manipulated, some undefined actor, or which have occurred previously are considered states and may be represented as postconditions or preconditions. For example, the actor of turn_on(timer~ight) is not the agent of the procedure, but the device being manipulated. This is thus not represented as an operation in the schemas but as a postcondition state of an agent operation."]},{"title":"2.2 Previous Work in Planning Instructions","paragraphs":["Previous work on planning the contents of instructional texts include Dale's EPICURE [1] and Mellish and Evans's system [9], which both start from the output of an AI task planner to select the text's content. However the first system seems only applicable to a particular domain; while the other seems to lack linguistic motivation.","In [1], all primitive operations of the task representation are included in the text as a sequence of actions. Furthermore, only these primitive operations are included in the text. In EPICURE's domain (cooking recipes), 90 to 100% of the content are action sequences [15]. Since the other knowledge available in the task representation (non-primitive operations, parent-child relations, ...) are usually not presented as action sequences, the strategy seems appropriate in this domain. However, it cannot be applied directly in most other domains where the proportion of action sequences is lower. On the other hand, to explain a plan, [9] includes in the text all operations and hierarchical relations available in the task representation. No result, condition, negative imperative [3], or other information found in naturally occurring texts are included. Moreover, the rhetorical strategies used do not seem linguistically motivated.","Our efforts are aimed at developing heuristics guiding the selection of content and rhetorical status to produce \"natural\" instructions. We have emphasized two types of tasks. According to the classification of [5], these are: operator tasks, ie. procedures on a system or device to accomplish a goal external to that system/device (eg. mow-ing the lawn); and maintenance/repair tasks, that is, specific operations on a system/device (eg. repairing a tape recorder)."]},{"title":"3 The Corpus Analysis","paragraphs":["In order to generate \"natural\" texts, we first analyzed a corpus of 15 French instructional texts (.~ 13,300 words) from different writers, domains, and text types.","Our view of instructional texts is rather larger than in other NLP research. For example, in [15, 12, 2] texts are restricted to execution-oriented instructions, where the reader is assumed to be the agent of the procedure. However, many texts that indicate how to perform a task are explanation-oriented and thus do not assume that the reader will immediately or even ever execute the procedure. Our corpus thus ranges from step-by-step procedures (also called procedural directives [4] and linear explanations [5]), like device manuals to explanations-oriented texts like arts and crafts books.","We performed an RST analysis only at the bottom level of the textual structure, that is at the inter- and intraclausal levels. As reported in Vander Linden [15] and RSsner and Stede [12], instructional texts use only a subset of RST relations. The most common are temporal sequence, circumstance/condition (c-condition4), result (volitional and non volitional), purpose, enablement and other non-procedural relations (attributes of objects, motivation ...).","4A c-condition combines RST's relations of circumstance and condition. It is what [15] and [12] call \"precondition\", but we prefer to use this term in its AI planning definition. 55 7th International Generation Workshop * Kennebunkport, Maine Â• June 21-24, 1994 3.1 A Semantic Level With the idea of using an AI task planner, and later rhetorical relations, we first set out to see how the knowledge available from a task representation (call it task knowledge) could directly determine rhetorical relations. In most cases, this is successful. For example, operation nodes in the task representation are mostly presented by action sequences, parent operation nodes by purpose relations, postconditions by results ... However in many cases, the same type of task knowledge is communicated through different relations.","For example, parent-child relations can be presented in the text by a purpose related to an action. In this case the relation is seen bottom-up and explains why the child operation should be performed, as in:","(1) Revissez l'6crou-capuchon sur la lyre pour ne pas le perdre. (Screw the screw-cap on the lamp shade holder so that you do not lose itfi)","A parent-child relation can also be presented by an enablement related to an action. In that case, the relation is seen top-down and explains how the parent operation should be performed, as in:","(2) R~gler la ceinture en la tirant par la languette: (Adjust the belt by pulling it by the flap.)","Another example involves preconditions which can be pre-","sented by a purpose relation or a c-condition, as in:","(3) a. Pour vous aider, poussez fermement le flanc du pneu","avec votre pied.","(To help you, firmly press the side of the tire with","your foot.) b. Si la victime est debout, placez-vous derriere elle.","(I] the victim is standing, place yourself behind him.)","As shown from these examples, the task knowledge does not uniquely determine the rhetorical relation used. The opposite is also true. In both examples (1) and (3a), a purpose relation is used, but in (1), it indicates a hierarchical relation and in (3a) it indicates a precondition on the \"press\" operation.","In order to map the task knowledge to the appropriate rhetorical structure, we have introduced an intermediate semantic level. This level classifies task knowledge into semantic carriers according to functional criteria (the mandatory/optional nature of operations, the execution time, the influence of an operation on the interpretation of the procedure ...). Semantic carriers help determine what task knowledge is introduced in the text and what rhetorical relation should be used.","For example, in (1), the parent-child relation carries a sense causality because it indicates that the \"screwing\" 5 All English translations are ours. operation will cause the agent not to lose the screw-cap. The parent operation (not losing the screw-cap) does not influence how the child operation should be executed but rather justifies it. For this kind of semantic carrier, a purpose relation is most frequently used. In (2) however, the execution of the \"pull\" operation is influenced by the \"adjust\" goal; it carries a sense of guidance on how the execution should be performed. In this particular case, an enablement relation was selected. In (3a), the precondition indicates an option that the agent will probably select, this explains why a purpose relation is used. Finally, in (3b), the precondition indicates a material condition; this semantic Carrier is mostly presented by a c-condition relation. 3.2 Some Results Figure 2 shows the correspondence between the task knowledge, the semantic carriers they can bring about, and the rhetorical relations used to present them. These semantic carriers are by no means the only way to interpret the information communicated in instructional texts (see for example [10, 3]), and only account for procedural type information. They are based on our interpretation of our corpus.","The heuristics to introduce certain semantic carriers rely heavily on the notion of basic-level operations introduced by Rosch [11] and Pollack [10]. Basic-level operations are those operations that people seem to remember and are able to represent mentally most easily. In the texts, they turn out to be detailed enough to be descriptive, but general enough to be useful. In her work, [11] found considerable agreement among people on the kinds of units of events that are remembered. For example, when asked to recall events that occurred in the morning, subjects remembered operations like brushing their teeth, taking a shower, but no one mentioned smaller units like squeezing the toothpaste tube ... or larger units like \"doing the morning chores\". It was hypothesized then that people have a more accessible memory representation for basic-level operations, than for any other type of event. This hypothesis seems appropriate in instructional texts: basic-level operations are included in the text as the writers have a memory representation for them and promote the reader's recall, for they can easily build a memory representation of the procedure. Then, depending on the level of knowledge of the reader, more or less detailed operations are given. Basic-level operations are a rather subjective notion and depend heavily on factors like the communicative goal, the discourse domain...","Only the most common semantic carriers (making up more than 80% of the texts) are discussed here.

SPIN builds a task representation from a top level goal and an initial description of the world using a hierarchical non-linear planning technique. The resulting hierarchy of plans is traversed breath-first by the text planner to select the semantic carriers. Then, the most appropriate local rhetorical relations are chosen. At the linguistic realization level, the actual grammatical form and position of the relations are selected based on the results of [15] adapted to French 9.","Figure 3 shores an output of SPIN. It indicates how to use the one touch recording (OTR) feature of a VCR (its English translation was given in section 1).

Let us deal with postconditions first: from the heuristics of section 3.2, recall that causalities from postconditions are included if the reader does not expect them. After consulting the model of the reader tÂ°, SPIN rules out the postconditions changed(speed) and changed(channel) already expected by the reader, and decides to include all other postconditions as causalities, using a result relation.","Because set (speed_SP) is a basic-level operation, SPIN selects it as a sequential operation. Because it does not satisfy the special case for using c-conditions, it is presented by an action sequence (sentence 2).

A guidance with the sub-operation press(channel.button) is therefore included. Because the operation specifies a particular instrument to be used, SPIN chooses an enablement to communicate this guidance (sentence 3). Specify(time) is not considered a basic-level operation, but press(0TR_button, 3_times) is. The reader may wonder why this last operation should be done (according to his model, he does not know that this operation is done to specify the time), so a causal-","9The positions of the rhetorical relations in both languages seem fairly similar, but the grammatical realization often differs.
