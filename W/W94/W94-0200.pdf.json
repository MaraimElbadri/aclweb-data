The meeting was sponsored by the ACL and by the European Network in Language and Speech (ELSNET).","The purpose of SIGPHON is to provide a forum for the interchange of research results, chiefly by organising conferences and workshops. In particular, its goals are to place computational phonology firmly on the research agenda in computational linguistics, to develop links between researchers in computational phonology, and to facilitate the dissemination of research results and software. SIGPHON provides an FTP server tot papers, implementations, back-issues of the quarterly newsletter, and a membership directory which lists the research interests of more than 100 people working in the field. The location of the FTP server is ftp. cogscÂ±, ed. ac. uk, and the materials can be found under/p~Jb/phor~ology.
