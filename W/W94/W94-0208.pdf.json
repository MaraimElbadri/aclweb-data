The first is the problem of parsing continuous speech into words given a developed lexicon to which in-coming sounds can be matched; both psychologists (e.g., Cutler & Carter, 1987; Cutler & But-terliel(I, 1992) and designers of speech-recognition systems (e.g., (]hur(:h, 1987) have examined I~his problem. However, the problem we examined is dilferent---we want to know how infants segment speech before knowing which phonemic seqllelW,('s form words.

Word stress in English fairly accurately predicts the location of word beginnings (Cutler & Norris, 1988; Cutler & Butterfield, 1992); Jusczyk, Cutler and II,edanz (1993) demonstrated that 9-monthohls (but not 6-month-olds) are sensitive to the common strong/weak word stress pattern in English. Sensitivity to native-language phonotactics in 9-month-olds was re(:ently reported by Jusczyk, I,'riedcrici, Wessels, Swmkerud and Jusczyk (1993).

He goes on to say, \"just how far in-forniation in the sound structure of the input can 83 pies, we see that Hypothesis 1 uses 48 characters and Hypothesis 2 uses 75. However, this simplis-tic method is inefficient; for instance, the length of lexical indices are arbitrary with respect to properties of the words themselves (e.g., in Hypothesis 2, there is no reason why/jul/was assigned tile in-dex '10'--length two--instead of '9'--length one).

Furtherrnore, the string and its components must be self-delimiting, so that a decoder could identify the endpoints of components by itself. The next sec-tion describes the binary representation and the length formulm derived from it in detail; readers satisfied with the intuitive descriptions presented so far should skip ahead to the Phonotactics subsection. Representation and Length Formulae The representation scheme described below ix I);~scd on information theory (for more examples of coding systems, see, e.g., Li L: VitKnyi, 1993 and Quinlan & Rivest, 1989). From this representation, we can derive a formula describing its length in bits. However, the discrete form of the formula would not work well in practice for our simulations. Instead, we use a continuous approximation of the discrete formula; this approxima-tion typically involves dropping the ceiling func-tion from length computations. For example, we sometimes use a self-delimiting representation for integers (as described in Li & VitS.nyi, pp. 74-75).

Since sentence I)oundaries provide informal.ion ahout word I)oumlaries (the end of a sentence is also the end of a word), our input contains sentence I~oumhu'ik~s; several studies (13ernstein-II.atm'r, 1985; Ilirsh-lh~sek et al., 1987; Kemler Nels~m, I lirsh-I'asek, ,lusczyk & Wright C;msidy, 1989; ,I usczyk et al., 1992) have shown that infimts can perceive senl,cncc I)oundarics using prosodic cues. Ih)wever, FiSher and 'lbkura (in press) found m) evidence that prosody can accurately predict word boundaries, .so the task of finding words re-mains. Finally, one might question whether in-Ikmts have the ability we are trying to model--that is, whether they can identify words embedded in sentences; Jusczyk and Aslin (submitted) found that 7 I/2-month-olds can do so. The Model To gain an intuitive understanding of our model, consider the f()llowing speech sample (transcripti{,u is in IPA):","Orthogral)hy: I)o you see tim kitty? Se(' the kitty?

Two comparisons are nee(ted to show that the cond)ination of disl.rilmtional and phonotactic information I)erfi)rnm I)(,tter than either sour(:e a.lolle: DIST-PIIONO COml)ared to I{,ANI)-i~IIONO, to see tin'. elrect of a(Idiug disl.ributionai analysis to phonotactic constraints, and DIST-PIIONO compared to l)IsT-I,'ltl,:l,;, to see l.he effect of adding phonotactic constraints to distri-- butional analysis. The former comparison shows that the sources corrlbined are more useful than phonotactic information alone, rl'he latter comparison is less obvious--the trade-off between recall and accuracy seems to have reversed, with no clear winner 5. Data on discovered word types helps make this conlparison: DIS'I'-I?IU,:I,~ found 12% of the words with 30% ac(:llraey an(1. Dis'r-PltONO found 33% of the words with 50% accuracy. Whereas the segmentation point data are in-conclusive, word type data demonstrate that combining information sources is more usefifl than using distributional information alone.","There is no obvious difference in performance between child- and adult-directed speech, except in DIST-PI1ONO (combined information sources) in which the difference is striking: accuracy re-mains high and recall rate more than tril)les for child-directed speeclL This difference is again supported by word type data: 14% recall with 30% accuracy for adult-directed speech, 56% recall with 65% accuracy for chihl-directed Sl)eech."]},{"title":"DISCUSSION","paragraphs":["Our technique segments continuous speech into words using only distributional and phonol,actic information more effectively than one might expect--up to 66% recall of segmentation points with 92% accuracy on one sample, which yields 58% recall of word types with 67% accuracy (the relatively low type accuracy is mitigated by the fact that most incorrect words are meaningf,,I concatenations of correct words --e.g., 'thekitty').","5'Fhe higher accuracy of DIST-I)HoNO is st good .sign.

In fact, it helps explain in-fa.uts' ability to h'a.rn words ['rom parental speech: these two sources alone are useful a]l(l infant,s have scw,ral oth(~rs, like prosody and word stress patterns, available as well. It also suggests that semanl.ics and isolated words need not play as central a role as one Might think (e.g., Jusczyk, 1993, downplayed the utility of words in isolation). It is dillicult, if not impossible given currently available methods, to determine which sources of informal.ion are necessary for infants to segment speech and learn words; only this sort of indirect evidence is availal)lc to us.","The results show a difference between adult-a.ml child-directed speech, in that the latter is ea.si~l' I,o sc~gm~ilt giv(m both distril)ution ;ul(I l)hono - tactics. This lends quantitative SUl)l)ort to research which suggests that mothercse dilthrs fl'o]u normal adult speech in ways possibly useful to the language-learning inl'aut (Aslin et al.). In fact, the factors making motherese more learnable might be chmidated using this technique: coral)are the re-suits of sevcra.I (lilt~rent models, each containing a. dilrercnt factor or combination of factors, looking for those in which a siibstautial i)erformanee dill~,renec exists b(itwecn child- and adult-directed Sl~eech.","()ur model uses phonotaetie constraints as al)- solute requirenlent!s on the structure of individual wt~l'tls; this iml)lies th;tt phonot;teties have been h'arncd prior to ;tttempts at segmentation. We must. therefore show that phonotactics can indeed he learned without access to a lexicon--without such a tlemonsl.raliion, we are trapped in circular rc;Lsoning. Gafos :and Brent (1994) demonstrate that phonotacties can be learned with high accuracy from the same unsegmented utterances we used in our simulations. In general, two meth-89 ods exist for combining information sources in ttle MI)I, I)aradign-l: one is to have absolute requirenllHits Oil plausible hyl*otheses (like our i)honota(:- tic co,lsl.rainl,s) -these requirements must I)e in-dCl)C,lÂ¢lcntly learnable; the other method of combination is to include an information source in the internal representation of hypotheses (like our distrib,ltional information)---all components of the representation are learned simultaneously (see EIl ison, 1992, for an example of multiple components in a representation).","We would like to extend the system by using a more detailed transcription system. We expect that this would help the system find word boundaries for reasons detailed in Church (1987)--in brief, that allophonic variation may be quite useful in predicting word boundaries. Another simpler extension of this researeh will be to increase l, he length of I,he speech samples used. Finally, we will try the current system on samples from other languages, to make sure this method generalizes approl)riately.","This research program will provide complementary evidence supporting hypotheses about the sources of information infants use in learning their natiw~ languages. Until now, research has focused ou demonstrations of infants' sensitivity to various sourees; we have begun to provide quantitatiw, memsures of the usefiflness of those sources.
