We argue that the link should be established by the lexical choice proces s using resources derived from Mel'~uk's Lezical Functions (LFs). In particular, we demonstrate that sequences of LFs may well serve as lexical discourse structure relations which link up to global discourse relations in the output of a Rhetorical Structure Theory style text planner."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["1.1 Identifying the Generation Gap In text generation, content selection and discourse organization (i.e. the text planning tasks) have often been dealt with independently from the linguistic realization of the tezt plan- the information selected and structured by the text planning process (eft, e.g., [McKeown and Swartout, 1987]). However, a text planning process which does not take into account linguistic resources that are available to express a particular meaning suffers from two major shortcomings: (i) it is not sensitive to variant discourse organiza-tions at the sentence level; and (ii) it cannot guarantee that its text plan is always verbalizable by the linguistic module. With other words, there is a discrepancy (a \"generation gap\" in Meteer's terms) between a text plan that is not tailored to linguistic resources and the input as required by the linguistic realization module. For extensive examples that illustrate this, see, especially Meteer's work [Mercer, 1991] and [Mercer, 1992], but also, e.g., [Rubinoff, 1992, Vander Linden et al., 1992]. In our work, we have found that especially lexical phenomena (such as lexical cooccurrence and lexical semantics) play an im-","portant role in discourse organization at the level of","sentence planning, which is still one of the unsolved","problems in text planning, cf. [Hovy, 1991]. Consider","the following example:","(1) a. Opa schofl auff den Einbrecher, der","nun tot ist","lit. 'Grandpa shot at the burglax who","is now dead'.","The interpretation of (la) does not necessarily suggest","that burglar's death is in consequence of grandpa's","shooting.

Therefore, a text generator has to provide an organization of lexical resources which makes explicit the rhetorical potential of lexical phenomena and which allows for the purposeful choice of these phenomena.","In principle, three ways seem to be feasible for how to proceed: (i) to broaden the task of text planning by lexical choice (eft, e.g., [Mercer, 1992]), (ii) to realize an interaction link between the linguistic realization module and text planning (eft, e.g., [Rubinoff, 1992]), or Off) to broaden the task of linguistic realization in order to deal with a final, lexically guided determina-tion of a discourse organization that has been predetermined by text planning. 137 7th International Generation Workshop * Kennebunkport, Maine Â• June 21-24, 1994","(R1/coNsCqUZRCZ",":acÂ¢ion (SROOT / SITUATION :actor (GRAmDFATXER/ PERSON",": in-focus '+) : actee (BURGLAR/ PERSON) : obligal;ory-roles ( : acl;or, : acl;ee,",": sitllat ion ) )",":consequence (BZIIIG-DEAD / SITUATION",":carrier (BURGLAR/ PERSON)",": obligatory-roles ( : carrier,",": situation))) Figure 1: A simplified text plan for sentences with the meaning 'Grandfather shoots at a burglar; in consequence, the burglar is dead.' \" spelling: ~schiellen ~ \"~"]},{"title":"1","paragraphs":["/"]},{"title":"[sp~tUag: \"Op-\"l","paragraphs":["[actor: I~LEX-OPAlperson: + ] / Lsin~'.da~: + J ,, | [spelling: \"Zlnbrecher ] [ actee: LEX-EINBRECHER[person: + | / L nÂ°un: + J Ltheme: la] Â• \"~'0 .... -~pe].ling: ~verwunden ~] ,."]},{"title":".....","paragraphs":["Lv~b:"]},{"title":"Ã· ] ',","paragraphs":["m .........

In contrast to, e.g., [Fawcett et al., 1992] and [Elhadad and Robin, 1_992], who deal with lexically biased sentence organization within the grammar, we take a radically lexicalist position (similar to that of [McDonald, 1991]) in that we assume that lexicalization has to take place before grammatical realization; and that it is the words chosen, which dictate the possible syntactic realizations of a content to be communicated. More precisely, we propose a two level discourse organization where the first level is provided by an RST style text planner and the second level by a separate lexical choice module. Then, the discourse organization of a text is done in two steps: in the first step, the text planner predetermines the discourse structure relations and selects the content; in the second step, the lexical choice module provides, in accordance with linguistic constraints, a finer specification and the realization of these relations and tailors their content to linguistic realization."]},{"title":"1.2 The Framework","paragraphs":["The computational framework in which our lexical choice model has partially been implemented is the systemic text generator KOMET [Bateman et al., 1991].

Thus, the process of SHOOTING has another lexiealization potential than that of CURINC; and the choice of fierce in The terrorists put up fierce resistance is done at another stage than the choice of put up. This calls for:","Â• a (fairly) excaustive coverage of the lexical potential of each semantic entity (such as process, event, etc.);","Â• clustering of lexical resources locally to semantic units of a certain size;","Â• a multilayered organization of lexical resources (and therefore also a multilayered lexical choice process). In our model, the resources are provided mainly by Lezical Functions as introduced in the Meaning Text Theory (MTT). They are clustered locally to situations and organized into four layers.","2.1 Using Lexical Functions as the Source of Lexical Resources Most excaustively, hxical phenomena have been described in MTT by Â£exical Functions.","Roughly speaking, an LF f is a standard semantico-lexical relation which holds between a lexeme L, (the keyword of f) and a set of lexemes f(L) (the value of If). Consider the following examples: So: 'situation' Sl : 'actor' Sin~tr: 'instrttment ' Ao: 'situational adj? V0: 'action' A.nti: 'antonym' Gener: 'hyperonyra' Magn: 'intense(ly)' Incep: 'beginning' Operl: 'perform' Prepar: 'prepare' Prox: 'be about to' So(to shoot) = shot Sl(tO ShOOt) = 9=nman, marksman Sinstr(to shoot) = r/fie, ann .... Ao(death) = mortal Vo(,ho0 = [to] ~hoot, [to] ~,, Anti(to hit) = [to] miss Gener( rifl,) = fire-arm Magn( injury) = ,e~ere mcep(com=) = [to] tap,~ It,to] (corn,0 Operl(shot) = [to] take (a shot) Prepar(to ,hoot) = [to] charge Prox(to shoot) = [to] aim at","Mel'~uk distinguishes about sixty simple LFS of the above kind. Simple LFs can further be composed with each other; the meaning of such complex LFs is, as a rule, a composition of the meanings of the participat-ing LFS. Thus, AntiMagn means 'slightly' (e.g., AntiMagn(injury) = minor); and IncepOperl 'start performing' (e.g., IncepOper1(shooting) = [to] start (shooting)). If several (simple or complex) LFs compose a phrase or a clause (as, e.g., AntiMagn and So compose minor injury), we separate these LFs by a 'o' sign.","In addition to complex LFs, we introduce LF sequences -- pairs of LFS (denoted LF1 A LFz), whose values cooccur at the syntagmatic axis. For example, Prepar(shooting) A Vo(shooting) with Prepar(shooting) = [to] charge (the gun) and Vo(shooting) = [to] shoot in He charged the gun and shot. LF sequences are directed, i.e. LFx A LF2 LF2 A LFx. Consider, e.g., Prepar A V0, which is an instantiation of a TEMPORAL SEQUENCE relation with the first LF expression preceding the second on the temporal axis, and V0 A Prepar as in He shot after charging the gun, where the first LF expression succeeds the second. Moreover, the existence of LFx A LFz for an entity in a language does not mean that LF2 A LFz is also available (consider, e.g., the following instantiation of A0 A Magn o So: She is beautiful --","a real beauty and Magn o So A A0: *She is a real beauty -- beautiful. Therefore, in LF sequences, one argument is the 'hub' m the point of departure (or the expanded LF) and the other argument is the 'hub expander'.","LFs and LF sequences (henceforth, both are referred to as 'LFS') have well-defined syntactic realizations. For example, Operz is defined as taking the ACTOR as grammatical'subject and the keyword of the situation as direct object. The LF sequence Operl A Magn o So -- when applied to SHOOTING m can be realized as a paratactic complex clause (of. Grandpa took a shot at the burglar; it was a good shot.~ or as a simple clause (eft Grandpa took a good shot at the burglar), but not, e.g., as a hypotactic complex clause (eft *Grandpa took a shot at the burglar, which was a good shot/one). And so on.","2.2 Compiling Lexical Resources Locally to Situations In accordance with [Apresjan, 1974], a situation is comprehensively defined by: 1. a predicate; 2. the constituents (i.e. potential participants and circumstantials) of this predicate; 3. the relations between different constituents as well as between constituents and the predicate (these relations are usually given in terms of actions, states, etc.); 4. the features of the predicate, constituents, and the above actions and relations.","The lexical resources of a situation (the Lezicaliza-139 7th International Generation Workshop Â• Kennebunkport, Maine Â• June 21-24, 1994"]},{"title":"tion Cluster","paragraphs":["in terms of [McDonald, 1991]) are then given by all possible wordings of the entities this situation is defined by.

We reported on an ongoing attempt to define a situation-specific, multilayered model of lexical resources that is based on Mel'~uk's Lezical Functions.
