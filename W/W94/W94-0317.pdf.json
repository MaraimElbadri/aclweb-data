A piece of argumentative text such as the proof of a mathematical theorem conveys a sequence of derivations. For each step of derivation, the premises (previously conveyed intermediate results) and the inference method (such as the application of a particular theorem or definition) must be made clear. The appropriateness of these references crucially affects the quality of the text produced.","Although hot restricted to nominal phrases, our reference decisions are similar to those concerning nominal subsequent referring expressions: they depend on the availability of the object referred to within a context and are sensitive to its attentional hierarchy. In this paper, we show how the current context can be appropriately segmented into an attentional hierarchy by viewing text generation as a combination of planned and unplanned behavior, and how the discourse theory of Reichmann can be adapted to handle our special reference problem."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["This paper describes how reference decisions are made in PROVERB, a system that verbalizes machine-found natural deduction (ND) proofs. A piece of argumentative text such as the proof of a mathematical theorem can be viewed as a sequence of derivations. Each such derivation is called a proof communicative act (PCA), following the viewpoint that speeches are actions. By reference choices we mean the explicitness of the verbalization of certain entities in the PCAs. Concretely, such decisions must be made for intermediate conclusions used as premises, as well as for the inference method. As an example, let us look at the PCA with the name Derive below:","(Derive Derived-Formula: u * Iu = u","Reasons : (unit(lu, U, *), u 6U)","Method : Def-Semigroup*unit)","Here, Derived-Formula is filled by a new intermediate conclusion the current PCA aims to convey, which is derivable by applying the filler of Method, with the filler of Reasons as premises. While the new conclusion will usually be handed over unchanged for verbalization, there are alternatives for referring to both the Reasons and the Method. Depending on the discourse history, the following are two of the possible verbalizations:","1. (inference method omitted): \"Since lu is the unit element of U, and u is an element of U, u* 1v = u.\"","2. (reasons omitted): \"According to the definition of unit element, u * 1v= u.\"","Note that, an explicit reference to a premise or an inference method is not restricted to a nominal phrase, as opposed to the traditional subsequent references. Despite this difference, the choices to be made here have much in common with the choices of subsequent references discussed in more general frameworks [Rei85, GS86, Da192]: they depend on the availability of the object to be referred to in the context and are sensitive to the segmentation of the current context into an attentional hierarchy. Although this observation is widely agreed upon for subsequent references, no consensus about where the segment boundaries lie has been reached. In PROVERB, we at-tack this problem by viewing text generation as a combination of hierarchical planning [Hov88, Moo89, Reigl, Dal92] and local organization [Sib90]. Following [GS86], moreover, we assume that every posting of a new task by the hierarchical planning mechnism creates a new attentional unit. As a consequence, the attentional hierarchy is equivalent to the plan hierarchy. Based on this segmentation of context, PRO VERB makes reference choices according to a discourse theory adapted from that of Reichman [Rei85, Hua90]."]},{"title":"2 The System PROVERB","paragraphs":["PROVERB is a text planner that verbalizes natural deduction (ND) style proofs [Gen35]. Several similar at-tempts can be found in previous work. The system EX-POUND [Che76] is an example of direct translation: Although a sophisticated linearization is applied on the input ND proofs, the steps are then translated locally in a template driven way. ND proofs were tested as inputs to an early version of MUMBLE [McD83], the main aim however, was to show the feasibility of the architecture. A more recent attempt can be found in THINKER [EP93], which implements several interesting but isolated proof presentation strategies. PRO VERB therefore can be seen 145 7th International Generation Workshop Â• Kennebunkport, Maine Â• June 21-24, 1994 as the first serious attempt to devise a comprehensive computational model that produces adequate argumentative texts from ND style proofs.","Most current NL text planners assume that language generation is planned behavior and therefore adopt a hierarchical planning approach [Hov88, Moo89, Da192, Rei91]. Nevertheless there is psychological evidence that language has an unplanned, spontaneous aspect as well [Och79]. Based on this observation, Sibun [Sib90] implemented a system for generating descriptions of objects with a strong domain structure, such as houses, chips and families. Once a discourse is started, local structures suggest the next objects available. From a computational point of view, a hierarchical planner elaborates recursively on the initial communicative goal until the final subgoals can be achieved by applying primitive operators. Local organization, on the other hand, chooses a part of the remaining task and carries it out. 2.1 The Planning Framework PROVERB combines both of these approaches in a uni-form planning framework [Hua94c]. The hierarchical planning is realized by so-called top-down presentation operators that split the task of presenting a particular proof into subtasks of presenting subproofs. While the Â• overall planning mechanism follows the RST-based planning approach [Hov88, Moo89, Rei91], the planning operators resemble more the schemata in schema-based planning [McK85, Par88]. Bottom-up presentation operators are devised to simulate the unplanned aspect, where the next intermediate conclusion to be presented is chosen under the guidance of the local focus mechanism. It is called bottom-up since one new intermediate conclusion or subproof is chosen and presented, using previously presented intermediate conclusions as premises.","The two kinds of presentation operators are treated differently. Since top-down operators embody explicit communicative norms, they are given a higher priority. Only when no top-down presentation operator is applicable, will a bottom-up presentation operator be chosen. The overall planning framework is realized by a function called Present. Taking as input a subproof, Present repeatedly executes a basic planning cycle until the input subproof is conveyed. Each cycle carries out one presentation operator, where Present always tries first to choose and apply a top-down operator. If impossible, a bottom-up operator will be chosen. The function Present is first called with the entire proof as the presentation task. The execution of a top-down presentation operator may generate subtasks by calling it recursively. 2.2 The Discourse Model and the Atten-","tional Hierarchy The discourse carried out so far is recorded in a discourse model. Rather than recording the semantic objects and their properties, the intermediate conclusions of a ongoing argument or mathematical proof are stored. Therefore, our discourse model consists basically of the part of the input proof tree which has already been conveyed. The segmentation of the discourse is described in section 3. The following are some notions useful for the formulation of the presentation operators:","Â• Task is the subproof in the input proof whose presentation is the current task.","Â• Local focus is the intermediate conclusion last presented, the semantic objects involved in the local focus are called the focal centers. 2.3 Proof Communicative Acts PCAs are the primitive actions planned to achieve communicative goals. When enriched with reference decisions, they are called preverbal messages (PM). Like speech acts, PCAs can be defined in terms of the communicative goals they fulfill as well as their possible verb-alizations. Based on analysis on proofs in mathematical textbooks, thirteen PCAs are identified and employed in PROVERB, see [Hua94b] for details. The simplist one conveying the derivation of a new intermediate conclusion is illustrated in the introduction. There are also PCAs that update the global attentional structure. These PCAs also convey a partial plan for the further presentation. For instance, the PCA (Begin-Cases Goal: Formula"]},{"title":"Assumptions: (A B))","paragraphs":["creates two attentional units with A and B as the as-sumptions, and Formula as the goal by producing the verbalization: \"To prove Formula, let us consider the two cases by assuming A and B.\" 2.4 Top-Down Planning Top-down presentation operators express communicative norms concerning how a proof to be presented can be split into subproofs, as well as how the hierarchically structured subproofs can be mapped onto some linear order for presentation. Because it is not the main concern of this paper, we will look at only one such operator, which handles proof segments containing cases. The corresponding schema of such a proof tree is shown in Figure 1, where the subproof rooted at ?L4 leads to F V G, while subproofs rooted at ?L2 and ?La are the two cases proving Q by assuming F or G, respectively. Under two circumstances a writer may recognize that he is confronted with a proof segment containing cases. First, when the subproof that has the structure as given above is the current presentation task, tested by (task ?L1) 1. Second, 1 Labels stand for the corresponding nodes 146 7th International Generation Workshop * Kennebunkport, Maine Â° June 21-24, 1994","F G : : :"]},{"title":"7;4: FVa CASE","paragraphs":["?L1 :A O Figure 1: Proof Schema Case when the disjunction"]},{"title":"FVG","paragraphs":["has just been presented in the bottom-up mode, tested by (local-focus ?L4).

This norm also requires that certain PCAs be used to mediate between parts of proofs. This procedure is ,captured by the presentation operator below.

Children of nodes are given in the order as they have been presented. The circles denote nodes which are first derived at this place, and nodes in the form of small boxes are copies of some previously derived nodes, which are used as premises again. The big boxes represent attentional units called proof units, created during the presentation process. The naturalness of this segmentation is largely due to the naturalness of the top-down presentation operators. For example, unit U2 has two subordinate units U3 and U4. This reflects a natural shift of attention between a subproof that derives a formula of the pattern 3~P(x) (node 10, 3~x E U), and the subproof that proceeds after assuming a new constant u satisfying P(u) (node 11, ul E U). There are also elementary units composed of multiple PCAs, such as U5 and U6. They produce two important premises required by a theorem about the concept solution, which are applied at node 20. It is interesting to node that elementary attentional units that contain multiple PCAs would be impossible, if we did not distinguish between hierarchical planning and local organization.","Adapting the theory of Reichman for our purpose [Rei85], we assume that each proof unit may have one of the following status:","Â• a unit is said to be. open, if its root is still awaiting to be conveyed.","- The active proof unit is the innermost proof unit containing the local focus. There is exactly one active proof unit at any moment.","- The controlling proof unit is the innermost proof unit containing the active unit.","- precontrol proof units are proof units containing the controlling proof unit.","Â• Closed units are proof units containing only conveyed proof nodes."]},{"title":"4 A Classification of Reference Forms","paragraphs":["This section presents a classification of the possible forms with which mathematicians refer to intermediate conclusions previously proved (called reasons) or to methods of inference.

Below are the three reference forms identified, which are analogous to the corresponding cases for reasons:","1. the explicit form: this is the case where a writer may decide to indicate explicitly which inference rule he is using. For instance, explicit translations of domain-specific rules could look like: \"by the definition of unit element\", or \"by the uniqueness of solution.\" ND rules have usually standard verbalizations.","2. the omit form: in this case a word such as \"thus\" or \"therefore\" will be used.","3. The implicit form: Similar to the implicit form for reasons, an implicit hint to a domain-specific inference method can be given either in the verbalization of the reasons, or in that of the conclusion."]},{"title":"5 Making Reference Choices for Reasons","paragraphs":["Because reasons are intermediate conclusions proved previously in context, their reference choices have much in common with the problem of choosing anaphoric referring expressions in natural language generation in general. A number of theories have been put forward to account for the pronominalization, which is usually ascribed to the focus mechanism. For this purpose, concepts like activatedness, foregroundness and consciousness have been introduced. More recently, the shift of focus has been further investigated in the light of a more structured flow of discourse [Rei85, GS86, Dal92]. The issue of salience is also studied in a broader framework in [PC93]. Apart from salience, it is also shown that referring expressions are strongly influenced by other aspects of human preference. For example, easily perceivable attributes and basic-level attributes values are preferred [DH91, Da192, RD92].","Common to all discourse based theories, the update of the focus status is tightly coupled to the factoring of the flux of text into segments. As illustrated in section 3, we basically follow the approach of Grosz and Sidner [GS86] in that a direct correspondence between the plan hierarchy and the attentional spaces is assumed.","With the segmentation problem settled, the reference choices in our theory largely follow the approach of Reichman. Reichman handles the reference problem in a more general framework of her discourse grammar [Rei85]. Based on empirical data, Reichman argues that the choice of referring expressions is constrained both by the status of the discourse space and by the object's level of focus within this space. In her theory, there are seven status as-signments a discourse space may have at any given time. Within a discourse space, four levels of focus can be as-149 7th International Generation Workshop Â• Kennebunkport, Maine Â• June 21-24, 1994 signed to individual objects: high, medium, low, or zero, since there are four major ways of referring to an object using English, namely, by using a pronoun, by name, by a description, or implicitly. Thirteen rules are formulated to assign level of focus to objects when they are activated, either with the initialization of a discourse unit or when they are added to the active unit. Four rules further reassign the level of focus on reentrance to a suspended discourse space. Based on the status assignment of discourse spaces, as well as the level of focus of individual objects, four rules are formulated constraining adequate referring expressions.","In short, Reichman takes into account both the foreground and background status of discourse spaces as well as the level of focus of individual objects. As a simplifica-tion for argumentative discourse, the notions of structural closeness and textual closeness are introduced.","The structural closeness of a reason reflects the foreground and background character of the innermost proof unit containing it. Intuitively, reasons that may still remain in the focus of attention at the current point from the structural perspective are considered as structurally close. Otherwise they are considered as structurally distant. If a re,on, for instance, is last mentioned or proved in the active proof unit (the unit a writer is currently working on), it is more likely that this reason should still remain in his focus of attention. On the other hand, if the reason is in a closed unit, and is not the root, it is very likely that the reason has already been moved out of the writer's focus of attention. Although the notion of fore- and backgroundness might actually be a continuum, our theory only distinguishes between reasons residing in proof units which are structurally close or structurally disrant. Rules assigning this structural status are given as following. 1. Reasons in the active unit are structurally close. 2. Reasons in the controlling unit are structurally close. 3. Reasons in closed units:","(a) reasons that are the root of a closed proof unit immediate subordinate to the active unit are structurally close.","(b) Other reasons in a closed unit are structurally distant.","4. Reasons in precontrol proof units are structurally distant.","Note that, the rules are specified with respect to the innermost proof unit containing a proof node. Rule 3 means that only the conclusions of closed subordinated subproofs still remain in the focus of attention. As a special treatment, premises of the entire theorem will be defined as both structurally distant and far in distance, if they are not repeated at the beginning of the proof.","The textual closeness is used as an approximation to the level of focus of an individual reason. In general, the level of focus of an object is established when it is activated, and decreases with the flow of discourse. In Reichman's theory, although four levels of focus can be established upon activation, only one is used in the formulation of the four reference rules. In other words, it suffices to track the status high alone. Based on the discussion above, we use only two values to denote the level of focus of individual intermediate conclusions, depending solely on the textual distance between the last mentioning of a reason and the current sentence where the reason is referred to.","In summary, we assume that each intermediate conclusion is put into high focus when it is presented as a newly derived result or cited as a reason supporting the derivation of a further intermediate result. This level of focus decreases, either when a proof unit is moved out of the foreground of discussion, or with the increase of textual distance. On account of the above, the four reference rules used in our computational model are given below. Choices for Referring Expressions for Reasons","1. If a reason is both structurally and textually close, it will be omitted.","2. If a reason is structurally close but textually far, first try to find an implicit form, if impossible, use an explicit form.","3. If a reason is structurally distant but textually close, first try to find an implicit form, if impossible, omit it.","4. An explicit form will be used for reasons that are both structurally and textually far.","Notice that the result of applying rule 2 and rule 3 depends on the fact that an implicit form is available, which often interacts with the verbalization of the rest of the PCA. In particular, it interacts with the reference choices for inference methods. In PROVERB as it currently stands, the interaction is realized by associating a keyword with the verbalization of every predicate, function, and assertion. For instance, suppose the verbalization of unit(F, 1, *) as a reason is \"since 1 is an unit element of F\", and the verbalization of the definition of unit element as an inference method is \"by the definition of the unit element\". Both the predicate unit and the definition are associated with the same keyword \"unit\". Based on this information, PROVERB assumes that the verbalization of the reason unit(F, 1, *) and the verbalization of the definition of unit element hint at each other. Distance is currently calculated in an ad hoc way by counting the PCAs uttered after the corresponding reason was last explicitly mentioned. 150 7th International Generation Workshop Â• Kennebunkport, Maine Â• June 21-24, 1994"]},{"title":"6 Making Reference Choices for Inference Methods","paragraphs":["Like the reference to a reason, the explicitness or implicitness of referring to an inference method at a particular point depends on whether the particular method can be easily called into the foreground of the focus of attention.

This referring behavior remains Â• the same throughout a whole discourse, similar to the referring behavior relating to the so-called canonical salience [PC93].

Now suppose that ul is such an X. According to the definition of unit element, ut * lu = ul. Since U is a subgroup of F, U C F. Therefore 1u E F. Similarly ul E F, since ul E U. Since F is a group, F is a semigroup. Because ul * 1u = ul, 1u is a solution of the equation ul * X = u~. Since 1 is a unit element ofF, ul * 1 = ul. Since 1 is a unit element ofF, 1 E F. Because ul E F, 1 is a solution of the equation ul * X = ul. Since F is a group, 1u = 1 by the uniqueness_of solution. This conclusion is independent of the choice of the element ul."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper describes the way in which PROVERB refers to previously conveyed intermediate results and inference methods while verbalizing natural deduction style proofs. By distinguishing between the planned and unplanned part of NL generation, PRO VERB achieves a natural segmentation of context into an attentional hierarchy. Based on this segmentation, PROVERB makes reference decisions basically according to a discourse theory adapted from Reichmann for this special application. The first experience shows that output texts are of good quality.","Currently, it proves difficult to compare text generated by PROVERB with naturally occurring texts, since the latter are usually at a still higher level of abstraction then the assertion level proofs we can reconstruct [Hua94a]. Nonetheless it might still be useful to build up a small corpus of texts. On the other hand, the naturMness of references could also be improved by further experiment-ing with different settings of the ad hoc thresholds in the system. We are also exploring more flexible lexicon choices as well as refinement of text planning process. Acknowledgment This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, SFB 314 (D2). Thanks are due to Dan Nesmith, who carefully read this final version. I am also grateful to the two anonymous reviewers for their critical and constructive remarks."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[Che76] D. Chester.
