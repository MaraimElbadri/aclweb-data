Our framework differs from standard generative frameworks inasmuch as we eschew all derivational analyses. Thus, we dispense with procedural transformations of underlying and intermediate representations into surface forms by means of the cyclic application of relatively unconstrained context-sensitive rewriting rules, lnstead, we adopt a strictly monostratal approach, wherein a single level of articulatory representa-tion is subject to linguistic constraints expressed declaratively using well-understood logical tools.","In order for our enterprise to succeed, we will require a rich representational system. To this end, we follow the lead of autosegmental and metrical phonology, taking our representations to be organized around natural groupings of articulators. A further similarity to autosegmental analyses and some traditional generative analyses is that we allow underspecification in our lexical rcpresentationsl But in contrast to these other theories, we adopt a single, concrete, surface-based representational system, rather than abstract underlying and intermediate representations of uncertain status. In particular, our approach is strictly monotonic, disallowing stages of analysis in which ill-formed representations are constructed and repaired. Instead, the linguistic constraints we impose, both universal and parochial, combined with possibly underspecified lexical representat.ions, conspire to fully determine surface representations. The result is a fully declarative system, albeit one which can be provided with a procedural interpretation in which lexicai (syntactic and semantic) representatk)ns are incrementally refined into surface representations, or vice-versa, by the application of constraints, citlmr sc~q,cntially or in parallel.","Wc haw\" chosen to employ feature structures for our phonological rel)rcsentations, a natural candidate for cu,straiut-based linguistic theories. Feature structures provide two mechanisms for constructing linguistic representations. The first is a multiple inheritance hierarchy of types, which allows the multi-dimensional classification of structures. The second mechanism is that of fi~atures, whose values are themselves modeled by feat.re structures.","Universal and parochial constraints, including lexical representations, are expressed using attribute-value logic. Expressions in our attribute-value logics are interpreted as restrictions on admissible linguistic structures. Being comprised of a representational system of feature structures subject to a collection of attributewdue constraints, our grammars are interpreted in a co-inductive, constraint-based fashion. More specifically, the admissible linguistic structures are modeled by those feature structures satisfying all of the constraints. This contrasts with traditional, inductive or rule-based generative accounts, in which well-formed representations are constructed from a primitive set of well-formed base cases by applying derivational rules.","Unlike many approaches to phonology, ours includes a careful consideration of the morphology-phonology in-t~,rface. It should be clear how our phonological theory can be integrated with a constraint-based theory of morphology, and thus to constraint-based theories of syntax and semantics. The result is a seamless theory of language relating phonology and semantics, mediated by morphology and syntax. One benefit of constructing such a unified theory is that constraint resolution algorithms can integrate constraints from diverse linguistic sources on-line during processing, as the speech signal is being received. An architecture supporting integrated processing is clearly desirable given the overwhelming psycholinguistic evidence concerning human processing. It is important to point out that our theory, being based on logical constraints over monostratal representations, can easily integrate diverse sources of constraints simply 1)y means of conjunction. The constraints themselves can be highly modular, both across components such as syntax all(.[ semantics, and within components such as phonology. By the same tok(m, it is sl, raighl.lbrward to integrate .niversal and i)arochial constraints, and any level of constraints in between, such as those found i. particular language families. Furthermore, subregularities within a language, which often stem from separate, possibly historically unrelated sources, can also be captured, without the resource to default mecha-13 nisms. A further desirable feature of our monostratal constraint-based approach is its declarative, relational nature, which allows the same linguistic constraints to be applied symmetrically to both generation alld understanding.","In what follows, we provide specifications of the most important universal constraints involved in syllable and metrical structure, with particular constraints for English syllabification, Malak-Malak and Yup'ik stress assignment, and Icelandic umlauting. For reasons of space, we are not able to include the full signatures (declarations of types) for these grammars, nor will we give all of the constraints necessary to define such a grammar. Readers interested in complete, implemented grammars, including all of the signature entries and collstraiuts, should consult (Mastroianni 1993).","Feature Structures and Constraints For linguistic representations, we adopt the feature structure formalism of (Carpenter 1992), which was modeled on the notion of feature structure employed in tiPS(3 (Pollard and Sag 1994). Feature structures are built out of two components, types and features. A specification of the behavior of types and their corresponding features is known as a signature.","A signature is built out of a finite set Type of types. We interpret types as sets of objects. To use a non-linguistic example, Nat might be the type of natural numbers, which is interpreted as the set {0, 1 .... , n, ...}. The types form a multiple inheritance hierarchy under a subtyping partial ordering E. If the type o\" is a subtype of a type v, then every object of type ais of type r. We write a _E rifthe type vis a subtype of o', and also say that cr is a supertypc of v. For instance, consonants, represented by the type cons are subtypes of segments, represented by the type seg, so we write sea D_ cons. Furthermore the type glide of glides is a subtype of cons, so cons E glide. Thus by the transitivity of partial orderings, glide is a subtype of type sea, so seg D_ glide. As an alternative example, we have a type bool of boolean values, with the truth values + and - as subtypes, so bool E + and bool E -. [f a ~ r, we also say that r is more specific than o-, or that cr is more general than r. More specific typ(~s provide more information about an object. Using a type hierarchy allows us to both factor constraints on different classes of representations and to state them at the appropriate level of generalization.","A type p is known as a unifier of the types o\" and r if it is a subtype of both of them, so that a _E p and r E_ p, in which case cr and r are said to be unifiable. For instance, the types for approximants and consonants, approx and cons, are unifiable, as they have a common subtype glide. A pair of types is unifiable if the information they contain is consistent. Thus the types + and - are not unifiable, as it is impossible for an object to be of both types. Similarly, the types nasal and obslruen! have no unifiers, as there are no segments which can be assigned to both types. One way to view unification is as a type-theoretic analogue of conjunction. For instance, glide has all of the information contained in the conjunction of approz and cons, plus perhaps some more. A pair tr and r of unifiable types must have a most general unifier, cr tA r, such that 0\" _E o\" IA r, r E_ a I.J r and for every unitier p of tr and r, o\" IA v E P. For instance, cons-approz, the type of consonant approximants, is the most general unifier of cons and approx. As another example, we use non-low as the type of non-low heights, and non-high for the type of non-high heights, and so we have the medium height, reed = non-high IA non-low, as their unification. We further define a most general or universal type, _k, with the property that, for any type r ill our ordering, .l. E r.","To construct feature structures, we also need a finite set Feat of features. The remaining component of a signature relates the features to the types by means of appropriateness conditions. These determine the features which can and must occur on each type, as well as constraining the types of their values. This is the sense in which we are dealing with a typed system, rather than simply a sorted one. An appropriateness assignment is a partial function Approp: Feat x Type ~ Type. A structure of type a is required to have a value for the feature f if and only if Approp(ff, a) is defined, and in addition, the value must be at least as specific as Approp(f, tr). For in-stance, we have Approp(LABIAL, place) ---- bool, which states that the feature LABIAL, representing whether there is closure of the vocal tract at the lips, must receive a boolean value in a feature structure representing the place of articulation. To take another example, we have Approp(NUCLEUS, syllable) = vowel, l which states that the value of a syllable's nucleus feature must be a vowel. In addition, Approp(MELODY, vowel) is undefined, which indicates that vowels do not receive melody values.","We require the appropriateimss assignment t.o respect the inheritance hierarchy according to standard object-oriented principles. In particular, subtypes inherit the features and value restrictions of all of their supertypes, which can be arranged in a multiple inheritance hierarchy. In such a system, we require that if a E r and Approp(f, a) is defined, then Approp(f, r) is defined and Approp(f,u) C Approp(f,r). For in-stance, sonorants inherit the melody feature from consonants, and heavy-open-syllables inherit the nucleus feature from syllables, but further constrain it to be a","1For simplicity, we ignore the case of languages which allow non-vowels to be the nuclei of syllables. We could generalize, for instance, by assuming","Approp(NUCLEUS, syllable) = approximant.nasal to account for the more general case, or we could refine our hierarchy to include a new supertype of vowels whose subtypes include liquids and nasals, say vocalic-nasaL 14 vowel Â• place"]},{"title":"AN'rmtmrt:[ boot]","paragraphs":["Â¢ ~OILONAI,:[ bool]"]},{"title":"[","paragraphs":["dorsal"]},{"title":"SACK :[ boot] I,t,ACl,:: DOItSAi,: nlOu:[bool] Low:[ bool] I,ABIAL:[ boot] TENSE:[ boot] STRESS:stress-vat TONE:tone-list","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Most General Structure of Type vowel heavy nucleus. 2","Feature structures are defined relative to a signature. A feature structure is taken to be a finite, rooted and directed graph, in which nodes are labeled with types and arcs with ffi~atures. Feature structures are typica.lly displayed as attril)ute-value matrices, where the I)ra.('keting indicates the nodes, and features indicate the arcs. Feature structures must satisfy the appropriateness conditions, so that a node of type o\" such that Approp(f, rr) is delined must be connected by an arc la-Iwh,d f to a node of type r such that Approp(f, cr) E r.

Every type must be a maximally specific one, in the sense of not having any further subtypes. For instance, occurrences of the type bool must be resolved to either + or -, and occurrences of type cons to either an obstruent, glottal-pharyngeal, nasal, liquid or glide. This amounts to a closed world interpretation of our type hierarchies, wherein every type can be equated logically with the disjunction of its subtypes (see (Car-I)enl,er 19!)2)). For instance, this equates souorant with 1.1,' di~iun('tion of the types glottal-pharyngeal, nasal and approx, so that ew~ry sol|oraut rrlltst t)c either glottal, nasal or al)l)roximanl..

This constraint is motivated computationally, in that it forces the type inference algorithm to produce a unique most general result. But this constraint can be easily relaxed (King and GStz 1993) or reconstructed from a hierarchy which does not meet it (Carpenter and Pollard 1992). low, exhaust the possibilities.

We take constraints on a type to be inherited by all of their subtypes. In general, we allow descriptions to specify types of objects, to specify the values of features by further descriptions, to impose equality and inequality constraints on objects. In addition, descriptions are taken to be closed under the logical operations of conjunction and disjunction, and the string operations of concatenation and Kleene-star. Finally, we allow relational and functional constraints by means of definite clauses. The string operations generalize the not;ion or c,,nsl, rainl, found in (Carpenter 1992) along lines suggested by l~eape (1991); such operations were coded by functional and relational constraints by Bird and Klein (1993) and by Mastroianni (1993).","We will follow (Mastroianni 1993) in our treatment of syllable structure and the arrangement of features in segments. This work is closely relal,ed I.o thai. preseuted in (Scobbie 1992), (Bird 1992), (Bird and Klein 1993), and (Russell 1993). One major difference between our work and that of both Bird and Scobbie is that we have given analyses of vowel harmony. Scobbie, because of his adjacency meta-constraint, is unable to do this, and Bird gives no account of such processes, either. In addition, we give an account of syllabification and stress, neither of which were attempted by Bird or Scobbie. Our work shares with Russell's a concern for the role of morphology both in triggering phonological operations and in interfacing with other components of grammar. Most of the analyses in these frameworks are compatible with our approach; we believe they are best viewed as instances of the same paradigm of monostratal, constraint-based morpho-phonology.","We will assume that the type 7rot has subtypes which a.re arranged as in Figure 2.

As shown by Pollard aml Sag (1987), this allows a great deal of redundancy in h~xical descriptions to be factored into constraints at suitable levels of generality using multiple inheritance. For instance, the harmony constraints given above will not need to be expressed on a word-by-word basis.","The goals allowable(C, Â¢, X) and harmonize(C, Â¢, X) in the lexical constraint ensure the following: (12) allowable(Â¢, Â¢, X)","l. nominative-singular words must have either -","or nil as their HARM values.","2. nominative-plural words must have either + or nil as their HARM values.","3. all nominative words have + as their WORD value.","4. all genitive and dative stems have - as their WORD value, and may have any HARM value. harmoniz('(Â¢, Â¢, X)","1. if a word has a hARM value of nil or -, its VOWELS value harmonizes with itself.","2. if a word has a HARM value of +, and its VOWELS value is a singleton list containing a, then it harmonizes with a singleton list containing 5.","3. recursively, if a word has a HARM value of +, and its VOWELS value is a list headed by a, then it harmonizes with a list headed by u only if the two list's tails harmonize.","4. a list of vowels headed by some other vowel than a or u harmonizes with itself. It should be noted that n-a-vowel subsumes all of the vowels except a and u. Thus, the line referring to it causes the harmony process to terminate whenever some other vowel than a or u occurs. The lexica[ constraint states that we can have molTh which is a nominative singular third person noun with semantics suit iff we have HOOTS: (f, oq, t, n, o~2, dh), and VOWELS (~1, c~2). Furthermore, the value of the HARMONY feature, (a, a), and (cq, or2) must harmonize. As we can see fi'om Figure 14, if the HARMONY value is either - or nil, then (al, or2) must actually be (a,a).

However, this is not really necessary. The WORD feature will come up again in the constraints on suffix and complex-word.
