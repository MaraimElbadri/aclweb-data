With a grammar oriented towards conceptual rather than phrasal structure, the approach shows some advant~ages over previous works in head-driven generation. ~It is particularly suited for multilingual generation systems where language-independent representations andlprocesses should be maintained to a maximum extent.

The system is semi-automatic in that the user designs an inter-lingual text specification describing content and form for a document. Genie constructs the document in the desired languages as modelled by the specification, matching contents to a knowledge base, constructing categories, and forming sentences according to combinatory rules.","The paper focusses on generation of language-specific categories from language independent conceptual structures."]},{"title":"2 The Document Analysis","paragraphs":["We have chosen a ll0-page manual, English ([3]) and Swedish ([8]), of the truck gearbox R1000 to analyse. The manual is for expert servicemen and shows the design, function, and service instructions.","The manual communicates some different kinds of domain information. We choose here to concentrate on the following two:","Â• Static information (i.e what something is). Examples: (1) The R1000 is a gearbox. (2) The.gearbox has nine forward gears. (3) The gearbox is mechanically operated. (1) RIO00 ar en v~xellÂ£da. (2) VÂ£xellÂ£dan hat nio v~xlar framÂ£t. (3) V~xell~dan manSvreras mekaniskt","Â• Processive information (i.e what something does). Examples: (4) The purpose of the inhibitor valve is to prevent inadvertant shifting of the range gear when a gear in the basic box is in mesh. (5) The inhibitor cylinder prevents inadvertant shiRing in the basic box when range shifts are being carried out. (4) Sp~rrventilen har till uppgift att fbrhindra v~xling av rangev~xeln n~r nÂ£gon av v~xlarna i baslÂ£dan ligger i in-grepp. (5) Sp~rrcylindern f6rhindrar v~xling i baslÂ£dan n~r vÂ£xling reed rangen sker. The text can be broken down into approximately sentence-sized units, each one communicating a piece of information considered true in the domain. We observe a tight correspondence between the kind of information and its textual realization. The carefully defined terminology not only determines words, but their combinations as well.","The text structure follows from conventions of language use for efficient communication about the domain. 245 7th International Generation Workshop Â• Kennebunkport, Maine Â• June 21-24, 1994","These findings are in line with the issue of domain communication knowledge (Kittredge [7]). Rhsner and Stede ([9]) distinguish similarly between the macro and micro structure of texts. The architecture of Genie is built up around the division of sentence and text structure; the user incorporates the conventions in the specification while Genie provides the terminological definitions.","The English and Swedish versions of the manual align at sentence level. Genie can cope with semantically nonequivalent sentence pairs, but not the very rare ones differing in content. Nevertheless, the documents correspond nicely compared to the difficulties Bateman reports ([1]) on a study of medical didactic texts. Grote and Rhsner ([5]) have studied car manuals for the TECH-DOC system, and they observe a close correspondence.","We have employed Functional Grammar (FG) (c.f [6]) as a principal analysis tool to developing representations for domain and language."]},{"title":"3 Domain Representation","paragraphs":["Domain representation is based on conceptual structures (Sowa [11]) and the transitivity structure of FG. Concept nodes are typed in an inheritance network. We follow Sowa's definition and notation of conceptual graphs.","Next, we sketch how static and processive information are represented as facts, called aspects and transitions, respectively, in the knowledge base. 3.1 Aspects An aspect contains a simple conceptual graph where an object has an attributive relation to a value. We define the is-a link as attributive and the type becomes the value. Sentence (1) and (2) are: [rlO00] -- (isa) --* [gearbox] [riO00] --* (f-gears) -+ [f-gear:colllfl, f2, ..., f9}@9] Both aspects happen to be close to their linguistic realizations, which is not necessarily always the case. 3.2 Transitions A transition is a concept trans with three relations, pre, means, and post. means has an event as value, pre and post hold circumstances that obtain before and after the event has occurred.","An event carries mandatory, e.g actor, goal, and peripheral role relations, e.g instr to other objects. We can differentiate roles into subtypes, e.g i-instr inhibits the event.","A circumstance can be: (i) a state characterized as a setting of some variable parameter. An example is in the aspect for sentence (4): [ trans] - (pre) -~ [ basic-boz-gears: disj { * ) ] -","(in-mesh) --* [4-] (means) ~ [range-shifting]-","( i-instr) ---~ [ inh-valve] (if) As an event, exhibited by sentence (5): [trans] -"]},{"title":"(gen-dur-pre)- [trans] - (means)--~","paragraphs":["[range-shifting] (means) ~ [basic-box-shifting]-"]},{"title":"( i-instr) [inh-cyO","paragraphs":["Sub-events have their own transitions as value for pre and post, which allows us to link events together, gen-dur-pre is a version of pre used to give a meaning to \"... being carried out\".","Transitions are more powerful than what has been outlined here. Much of their internal temporal constituency, complex parameters, lambda-abstractions, and different kinds of constraints have been left out for clarity."]},{"title":"4 Linguistic Representation","paragraphs":["This section describes how Genie derives categories for a fact, as part of generation. We first describe English categories briefly. 4.1 Categories Categories are expressed in a language of typed feature structures. We define how categories can be formed, their different types and content.","Construction of categories are inspired by modern Categorial Grammars (CG), such as UCG (c.f [12]), but differ in some respects. The set of categories g is defined recursively, (i) Basic categories E g. (if) If A and B E g, then the complex category AIB E g.","The differences from CG are (i) the association of categories to facts and concepts, and (if) complex categories are non-directed.","Categories compose using the reduction rule to unify: AIB, B ~ A Categories are expressed as typed feature structures (tfs) (c.f Carpenter [2]). a(name) denotes the set of attributes the type name carries, and s(name) the immediate subtypes, cat is the root with a(cat) = {}, s(cat) = {zcat, bcat), xcat is the I operator, bcat are the basic categories, a(bcat) = {:fb, st), s(bcat) = {Icat,pcat). Icat and pcat are the lexical and phrasal categories. The attribute fb holds some feature bundle, rooted at fb and named appropriately, e.g np-fb, n-fb, agr-fb, st has a FG 246 i 7th International Generation Workshop Â• Kennebunkport, Maine Â• June 21-24, 1994 mood-structure to hold subcategories.

The grammar rules state that a particular domain type corresponds to a category with certain combinatorial properties. If violated, the rule cannot derive an adequate category for the fact.

It behaves as the standard semantic-head driven generator (SHDG) (Shieber et al [10]) does when all nodes are pivots, i.e a purely top-down manner. SHDGs in general are quite different from ours in the way knowledge is organized. They follow the structure of categories in grammars that are more suitable for parsing, i.e allowing content-less words but not word-less contents. Hence, there is an assymetry between compositionality of words and semantics (Dymetman [4]). A content-less word can potentially occur anywhere in the output string and a generator must consider this to terminate gracefully. Problems of ensuring coherence and completeness degrade efficiency further. Our generator resembles a parser to a large extent, having a conceptual structure instead of a string to work on. As such, it is free from the problems and can potentially benefit directly from many research results in parsing technology.","The rules are designed to work on any language, thus lessening the burden when adding more linguistic support. More rules have to be written only when new kinds of facts are added to the knowledge base, to account for their structures. We do not need a reachability relation, as the problem of goal-directedness in generation is achieved by doing clever choices of categories in lexical rules.","The relations between domain types and categories are similar to the semantic type assignments in classic CGs. Our version is more flexible as a consequence of the type system.","Genie is in an experimental state (about 20 aspects and 10 transitions), but has proven feasability of the issues discussed in this paper. It is less competent in lexical choice and the combinatory grammar. Development is continuing in the Life environment."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] John A.
