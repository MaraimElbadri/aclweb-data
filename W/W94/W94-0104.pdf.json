Starting from a linguistic study of the terms of telecommunication domain, we designed a number of filters which enable us to obtain a first selection of sequences that may be considered as terms.

This method has been applied to French and to English, but this paper deals only with French."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["A terminology bank contains the vocabulary of a technical domain: terms, which refer to its concepts. Building a terminological bank requires a lot of time and both linguistic and technical knowledge. The is-sue, at stake, is the automatic extraction of terminology of a specific domain from a corpus. Current research on extracting terminology uses either linguistic specifications or statistical approaches. Concerning the former, [Bouriganlt, 1992] has proposed a program which extracts automatically from a corpus sequences of lexical units whose morphosyntax characterizes maximal technical noun phrases. This list of sequences is given to a terminologist to be checked. For the latter, several works ([Lafon, 1984], [Church and Hanks, 1990], [Calzolari and Bindi, 1990], [Smadja and McKeown, 1990]) have shown that statistical scores are useful to extract collocations from corpora. The main problem with one or the other approach is the \"noise\": indeed, morphosyntactic criteria are not sufficient to isolate terms, and collocations extracted thanks to statistical methods belong to various types of associations: functional, semantical, thematical or uncharacterizable ones. Our goal is to use statistical scores for extracting technical compounds only and to forget about the other types of collocations. We proceed in two steps: first, apply a linguistic filter which selects candidates from the corpus; then, apply statistical scores to rank these candidates and select the scores which fit our purpos(~ best, in other words scores that concentrate their high values to terms and their low values to co-occurrcuccs which are not terms."]},{"title":"Linguistic Data","paragraphs":["In a first part, we therefore study the linguistic specifications on the nature of terms in the technical domain of telecommunications for French. Then, taking into account these linguistics results, we present the method and the program which extracts andcounts the candidate terms. Linguistic specifications Terms are mainly multi-word units of nominal type that could be characterized by a range of morphological, syntactic or semantic properties. The main property of nominal terms is the morphosyntactic one: its str,c-ture belongs to well-known morphosyntactic structures such asN ADJ, N1 de N2, etc. that have been studied by [Mathieu-Colas, 1988] for French. Some graphic indications (hyphen), morphological indications (restrictious in flexion) and syntactic ones (absence of determiners) could also be good clues that a noun phrase is a term. We have also employed a semantic criteria: the criterion of unique referent. A term refers to an unique and universal concept. However, it is not obvious to apply this criterion to a technical domain where we are not expert. So, we have interpreted the criterion of unique referent by the one of unique translation. A French term is always identically translated, mostly by a compound or a simple noun in English.

To filter base-terms from the corpus, we use their morphosyntaetic structures. For this task, we need a tagged corpus where each item comes with its part-of-speech and its lemma.

Linguistic filters We now face a choice: we can either isolate collocations using statistics and then apply linguistic filters, or apply linguistic filters and then statistics. It is the latter strategy that has been adopted: indeed, the former asks for the use of a window of an arbitrary size; if you take a small window size, you will miss a lot of occurrences, mainly morphosyntactic variants, base-terms modified by an inserted modifier, very frequent in French, and coordinated base-terms; if you take a longer one, you will obtain occurrences that do not refer to the same conceptual entity, a lot of ill-formed sequences which do not characterizes terms, and moreover wrong frequency counts as several short sequences are masked by only one long sequence. Using first linguistic filters based on part-of-speech tags appears as the best solution. Moreover, as patterns that characterizes base-terms can be described by regular expressions, the use of finite automata seems a natural way to extract and count the occurrences of the candidate base-terms. The frequency counts of the occurrences of the candidate terms are crucial as they are the parameters of the statistical scores. A wrong frequency count implies wrong or not relevant values of statistical scores. The objective is to optimize the count of base-terms occurrences and to minimize the count of incorrect occurrences. Graphical, orthographic and xnorpho.sy.t;wtic variants of base-terms (except synomymic varbmt,~) are taken into account as well as some syntactic variations that affect the base-terms structure: coordhm-tion and insertion of modifiers.

In other words, the histogram of the ideal score should assign to equivalence classes containing the high values (resp. low values) of the score a ratio close to 1 (resp. 0).

All of","3Only pairs which appear at least twice in the corpus have been retained. them show a general growing trend that confirm that the score values increase with the strength of the bond of the ]emma. However, the growth is more or less clear, with more or less sharp variations. The most beautiSd histogram is the simple frequency of the pair (see Figure 1). This histogram shows that more frequent tile pair is, the more likely the pair is a term. Frequency is the most significant score to detect terms of a technical domain. This results contradicts numerous results of lexical resources, which claim that association criteria are more significant than frequency: for example, all the most frequent pairs whose terminological status is undoubted share low values of association ratio (formula 1) as for example rdseau d satellites (satellite network} IM=2.57, liaison par satellite (satellite link) IM=2.72, circuit tglgphonique (telephone circuit )IM=3.32, station spatiale (space station) IM=l.17 etc. Tile remain-ing problem with the sort proposed by frequency is that it integrates very quickly bad candidates, i.e. pairs which are not terms. So, we have preferred to elect the Loglike coefficient (formula 3) the best score. Indeed, Loglike coefficient which is a real statistical test, takes into account the pair frequency but accepts very little noise for high values. To give an element of comparison, the first bad candidate with frequency for the general pattern N1 (PREP (DEW)) N2 is the pair (cas, transmission) which appears in 56th place; this pair, which is also the first bad candidate with Loglike, appears in 176th place. We give in figure 2 the topmost 11 french pairs sorted by the Loglike coefficient (Logl) (Nbc is the number of the pair occurrences and IM the value of 33 association ratio).

Starting from a first selection of lemma pairs representing candidate terms from a morphosyntactic point of view, we have applied and evaluated several statistical scores. Results were surprising: most association criteria (for example, mutual association) didn't give good results contrary to frequency. This bad behavior of the association criteria could be explained by the introduction of linguistic filters. We can notice anyway that frequency characterizes undoubtedly terms, contrary to association criteria which select in their high values frozen compounds belonging to general language. However, we preferred to elect the Loglike criterion rather than frequency as the best score. This latter takes into account frequency of the pairs but provide a conceptual sort of high accuracy. Our system which uses finite automata allows to increase the results of the extraction of lexical resources and to demonstrate the efficiency to incorporate linguistics in a statistic system. This method has been extended to bilingual terminology extraction using aligned corpora ([Daille et al., 1994]).","Acknowledgments I would like to thank the IBM-France team, aJl<l i. particular l~ric Gaussier and Jean-Marc Laug6, Ibr tl,~ tagged and lemmatized version of the French corpus all(I for their evaluation of statistics; Owen Rainbow f.r r~.- viewing.
