This year, EMNLP is held in conjunction with the First International Language Resources and Evaluation Conference in Granada, Spain, which is concerned with existing and required resource development to support language processing work in an increasingly multi lingual setting. Indeed, the development of natural language applications that handle multi lingual information is the next major challenge facing the field of computational linguistics. Given this context, this year's EMNLP conference is focused on work that describes and evaluates the strengths, weaknesses, and recent advances in corpus-based NLP as applied to multi-lingual applications. In particular, many of the papers in this volume consider questions such as the following: how well do techniques for lexical tagging, parsing, anaphora resolution, etc., handle the specific problems of multi-lingual applications? What new methods have been developed to address the deficiencies of existing algorithms for these tasks or to address problems specific to handling multi-lingual applications? What problems still lack an adequate empirical solution? Conversely, how can data-driven NLP methods be improved with the help of multi-lingual data? It is appropriate that this is the first EMNLP conference to be held outside the U.S. We are very encouraged to see the participation of so many researchers from Europe and Asia, which will result, we hope, in greater communication and collaboration across the international NLP community. Many people arc owed thanks for their contributions to setting up this conference. In particular, Atro Voutilainen, EMNLP3 co-chair, and David Yarowksy, SIGDAT chair, provided continual and indispensable help and support throughout. The EMNLP3 Program Committee enabled us to work within a very bri~f time frame, by quickly turning around all the reviews for the substantial number of submissions to the conference. Finally, the LREC conference organization committee at the University of Granada, the LREC program organizers at the Istitnto di Linguistica Computazionale in Pisa, and the Department of Computer Science at Vassar College provided administrative and organizational support. All of them are responsible for the success of EMNLP3.
