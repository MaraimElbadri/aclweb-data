In particular, we look at lexical rules as a conceptual tool to link forms with the same semantics as is the case between nominalisations and the forms they are derived from. We also address Chinese compounds, illustrating how to recover implicit semantic relations in nominal compounds. Finally, we show how to translate Chinese nontinals within a knowledge-based framework. 1 Introduction In this paper, we present results of a theoretical and an applied investigation, within a knowledge base framework, on the building and processing of computational semantic lexicons, as reflected by experiments done on Spanish, English and Chinese, with a large scale application on Spanish. The multilingual dictionaries making process (Viegas and Raskin, 1998) has been tested and attested for Mikrokosmos, a machine translation system (Nirenburg et al., 1996) from Spanish and Chinese to English. 2 Here, we focus on Chinese nominals and compounds in terms of representation and processing.","In Section2, we briefly present the information carried inside Mikrokosmos lexicons. In Section 3, we show how a semantic-based transcategorial approach is best fitted to account for nominalisations and their derived forms. Formally, we use the conceptual tool of lexical rules as described in (Viegas et al., 1996). In Section 4, we address the Iranslation of Chinese nominal compounds into English using semantic information and word order information. We show the advantage of a transcategorial approach to lexicon representation and investigate some trade-offs between an interlingua and transfer approach to nominal compounding.","XThis work has been supported in part by DoD under","contract number MDA-904-92-C-5189.","2The interested reader can visit the Mikrokosmos site","at http://crl.nmsu.edu/Research/Projects/mikro/.","2 A Brief Overview on the Structure of Mikrokosmos Lexicons In Mikrokosmos, the lexical information is distributed among various levels, relevant to phonology, orthography, morphology, syntax, semantics, syntax-semantic linking, stylistics, paradigmatic and syntagmatic information, and also database type management information. 3","Each entry consists of a list of words, stored in the lexicon independently of their POS (the verb and noun form of walk are under the same superentry). Each word meaning is identified by a unique identificator, or lexeme (Onyshkevych and Nirenburg, 1994). Homonyms and all meaning shifts of polysemous words are listed under one single superentry. 4","We illustrate in Figure 1 relevant aspects, for this paper, of a lexicon entry via the description of two senses of the Chinese word ~ (activity): WorkActivity and Exercise, which are well defined symbols or concepts in the Mikrokosmos ontology as described in (Mahesh, 1996).","Word meanings in Mikrokosmos are represented partly in the lexicon and partly in the ontology. We have strived to achieve an intermediate grain size of meaning representation in both the lexicon and the ontology: many word senses have direct mappings to concepts in the ontology; many others must be decomposed and mapped indirectly through composition and modification of ontological concepts. We have developed a set of guidelines and a training methodology that results in acceptable quality and uniformity in lexical and ontological representations (Mahesh, 1996; Viegas and Raskin, 1998). In principle, the separation between ontology and lexicon is as follows: language-neutral meanings are stored in the former; language-specific information in the latter.","We keep the number of concepts well below the number of lexical items for a given language, such","aDeLails on these zones can be found in (Viegas and Raskin, 1998; Meyer et al., 1990).","4See (Weinreich, 1964), (Fillmore, 1971), (Cruse, 1993), (Pustejovsky, 1995) for interesting accounts on homography/polysemy.

The advantage of MSLRs is twofold: first, they can be considered as a means to reduce the number of lexicon entry types, and generally to make the acquisition process faster and cheaper; second, they can enhance the results of analysis processing by creating new entries for unknown words from the lexicon, found in corpora.

We applied the same methodology to Chinese. The rules are language independent, what is language dependent is the morphemes to which they can apply. For Chinese, we do not have to worry about develop-ing a morpho-semantic generator as the productivity in morphology is poor, if one excepts compounds characters in which semantics is not compositional (see the example of ~ (glucose) below). In this latter case, we acquired the entry manually. So rules are used to link nominalisations to verbs, and vice versa, meaning that once verbs have been acquired, nominal derivations can be produced automatically using rules.","(1) a. ~-Vl(affirm) b. j~-Nl(affirmation)","We present below the entry for ~-N1 (affirmation) after the application of the LR2event rule on ~-V1 (affirm).","#0= lkey:~, gram:lpos: N], semRep:#sem, synSenn:[gram:#ol, semRep:#t], [grarn:#o2, semRep:#a], lexRule: LR2event[root :[key: ~ ~,","gram:[pos:V, subc:NPVNP],","semRep:#sem=[narne:Assert,"]},{"title":"agent:#a, therne:#t]], vn:#0]]","paragraphs":["In our corpus (from the Chinese newspaper Xinhun Daily), we found that 166 nouns could be derived from 351 verbs; that is, almost 47% of verbs can produce nouns. From an acquisition viewpoint, it is cheaper to use the mechanism of lexical rules to automatically produce nouns from verbs, with the same semantics, this is due to our transcategorial approach to semantics, where the same piece of semantics can be lexicalised as either a Noun or Verb. 4 A Transcategorial Approach Compounding in Chinese is a common phenomenon (Jin, 1994; Jin and Chen, 1995; Palmer and Wu, 1995). It is mainly used to combine i) characters whose semantics is different and non compositional, and ii) sequences of nouns.","In i) we create entries for single characters and entries for combined characters, (e.g., (2)):","(2) a. ~j (grape) b.

In the following, we investigate three ways to translate Chinese nominal compounds into English, using word order information, semantic information and co-occurring information in syntactic, semantic and transfer approaches, respectively. 4.1 A. Syntactic A.pproach Compounds proliferate in Chinese. The head of the compound seems to be easily identified as the last noun in the sequence, and therefore in the task of translating Chinese compounds into English compounds, where English also makes use of compounds as opposed to say French, one could adopt a transfer-based approach, where each Chinese noun is translated into English in the same sequence: 1~"]},{"title":"~ (application software); ~$.~ q~ ~.~ (data management system).","paragraphs":["It gets a bit more complex 21 when there is a large sequence of nouns in English, whereas it is still acceptable and normal ill Chinese.

How-ever, as discussed earlier, 1) this approach is knowledge intensive, and 2) English compounding seems to follow the same Chinese word order regularly enough so that we consider using a transfer approach as a back-up to generation. 4.3 A Transfer-based Approach Semantics can be expensive to use so we also rely on a transfer-based approach as a back-up method when semantics fails to give us the semantic relation between the nouns. We can do this because English allows compounding (whereas for French and Spanish, a transfer approach would be more problematic as compounding is not as productive and relations must be identified). However, as we noticed previously, it can become difficult in English to get the meaning of a large compound, it is therefore better to \"break\" the compound into 2 or 3 compounds.

We showed how to use lexico-semantic rules to relate different forms carrying the same semantics. These rules can be applied at run time in analysis, thus facilitating a syntactico-semantic recovery for unknown words. Concerning compounds, we have shown that we can-not avoid a semantic approach if we want a high quality translation, because of the number of nouns which can enter into a Chinese compound making it difficult to get the meaning of the compound in English. Thus, breaking the compound necessitates an understanding of the Chinese compound. How-ever, we have suggested transfer-like approach for Chinese to English translation with the use of cooccurrences to \"signal\" privileged lexical links (computer database).","We have illustrated that by considering tile information in the lexicon as constraints, the linguistic difference between pure compositionality and cooccurrent information becomes a virtual difference for ttG.
