In particular we address the semantic representation of syntactically unexpressed arguments.We put forward a treatment of this kind of optional complements in a framework that combines HPSG syntax and the semantic approach in GL (Pustejovsky, 1995). 1 Introduction In this paper we address the representation of nouns having complex argument structures like deverbal nominalisations (and other nouns with complements). These classes of nominals very often appear in the surface string without their complements, even if they are semantically implied. Such semantic implications are often shown in discourse, so that anaphoric references cannot be accounted for without taking them into account. We put forward a treatment of unexpressed complements to nouns in a framework that combines HPSG syntax and the semantic approach in GL (Pustejovsky, 1995).","In the next section we present some data concerning the semantic implications of syntactically unexpressed complements. Our data are basically from Catalan, but the discussion is clearly applicable to other languages including English. In the third section we discuss the de-ficiencies of the standard treatments of optionality of complements. Finally, in section four we put forward our proposal. We concentrate on the representation of deverbal nominalisations, but we discuss some other kinds of optional complements to nouns. 2 Data Most predicative nouns (i.e., those having complements) may or may not have their complemerits present in the sentence. 1 In other words most complements to nouns are optional (in an appropriate context): 2","(1) a.

Aquesta tarda un grup de nens This afternoon a group of children jugavaa la plata played on the square E1 grup 1' ha acceptat molt The group him/her has accepted very b@ well","Of course optionality of complements is not limited to nominal complements: it is pervasive among verbal complements as well. Even within the context of verbal complements the discussions in the literature show that the distinctions between classes of complements are far from obvious. At the simplest level a twofold distinction","1Here and throughout this paper we use the term \"predicative noun\" to refer to nouns that can have complements, thus including deverbal and adjectival nominalisatioas and relational nouns.","2In the following a-examples the complements of nouns that are omitted in the b-examples are written in bold face. Note that the contexts usually have to be different. may be proposed between (obligatory) complements and (optional) adjuncts. This however does not comply with the facts since it groups together very different classes of optionality: grammatically induced elision (4), optionality with semantic implications (5), as a pure ad-junct (6)... 3","(4) a.

Avui he estat pintant Today have(I-s) been painting","These very simple examples show that the presence or absence of complements to predicative heads is not uniform from a semantic point of view. There are complements which are semantically external to the predication, whereas there are others that are internal (that is to say, that contribute some entity to the relation denoted by the predication). And complements may or may not be present according to their semantic relation to the head. Most external complements (i.e., adjuncts) are always optional: they may be present or absent irrespective of their particular relation. 4 But there are many internal complements that can be optional and some cannot be present except under very specific circumstances; these are the complements described as default- and shadow-arguments respectively in Pustejovsky (1995:63f):","3Some authors have proposed a graded classification consisting of 5 to 7 classes (Somers, 1987).","4However there are a few cases where one might want to say that there are obligatory adjuncts, as for example in: this suit washes easily.","(7) a. D-Arg: John built the house out of bricks","b. S-Arg: Mary buttered her toast with an expensive butter","When dealing with a purely syntactic grammar (or lexical representation) all these aspects boil down to determine the degree of optionality of the complement and to deal with the variation in syntactic behaviour accordingly. That is to say in many implementations of syntax some optionalities are dealt with by general rules or principles (this is clearly the case of the optionality of the logical subject, which is either accounted for by a passivisation/impersonalisation rule of the grammar or by a lexical operation) and some are accounted for by listing them as different entries (or just as subentries of the same entry). But except for the cases where a grammatical relation clearly exists that applies to most lexical items of a particular class (as passivisation to transitives), the optionality of complements is dealt with by listing all the options in the dictionary. Furthermore such a treatment does not include some of the complements that are allowed only under certain very specific circumstances (e.g. D-Arg, S-Arg) since these can only be spelt out in semantic terms.","Not surprisingly the application of these no-tions of obligatory and optional complements (developed for VPs and Ss) to NPs has not been successful: too many arguments in the NP are optional and there is too little grammatical control (such as the one we find in passivisation) for general, syntactically based treatments to be successful. Note that even the simple distinction between objective and subjective complements cannot be made operative on syntactic terms in Catalan and other languages (i.e., without taking into account their semantics):","(8) a. l' estudi de les plantes the study of the plants","b. la soluci6 dels estudiants the solution of-the students","c. 1' avaluaci6 dels inspectors the evaluation of-the inspectors","But in addition there are strong reasons to consider that a semantic approach has to be taken to predicate-complement representation if we consider discourse factors, such as coherence, anaphora and the recovering of implications. Consider the following examples:","(9) a. La decoraci5 del pont The decoration(f-s) of-the bridge(m-s) ens ha portat molt de temps, perb ha us has taken much of time, but has quedat molt ben acabada! resulted very vell finished(f-s)!","b.

Hem amanit l' enciam i l' Have(l-p) dressed the salad and it(ac) hem hagut de llenqar perque have(l-p) hat to throw-away because l' oli era ranci the oil was rancid","These examples show that complements not explicitly present in the NP or VP can be referred to or implied in discourse. Of course the subject of acabada (9a) and natural (9b and 9c) is only recoverable as the result of the decorating and translating act respectively; and the use of definite specifiers el seu and I in (9d) and (9e) is allowed by the \"hidden\" complement of mare and amanir.","3 Standard treatment in argument structure The standard treatment of syntactically oriented representations introduces some level of abstract description of argument structure in syntax, so that general grammatical relations can be accounted for in a straightforward way. Thus, content relations can be stated between arguments and their heads that differ from the surface syntactic ones. In HPSG, for example, control relations are expressed as coindexation between syntactic and argument values, in such a way that a single valence element realises two argument slots; and passive is (lexically) dealt with as a change in the correlation between valence elements and argument ones. 5","But this level where argument structure is usually represented is a direct projection (al-though neither simple, nor one-to-one) of the surface structure. That is to say there are difficulties in incorporating new argument slots when no correponding syntactic slot exists. And this is so simply because the argument values are not thought as full semantic representations but simply as the deep representation of syntactic structure. 6","Being syntactically oriented, the standard treatments of argument structure can only represent the types of complements that correpond to the simple twofold distinction mentioned in the previous section: strongly restricted obligatory complements and optional adjuncts. ~ Nonetheless, there are at least three aspects that are not considered in a satisfactory way: complements to verbs and to nouns which are not linked with a strong syntactic and semantic relation, but cannot be treated as ordinary adjuncts, i.e., intersectively (as for in-stance the kind of complements mentioned in footnote 4); complements to nouns generally, because they usually are optional (as in (1) to (3) above); and some complements to verbs which are manifestly optional (as in (5)). This is so because in the standard typing of arguments","5Recall that the syntactic valence is expressed in HPSG as a list of descriptions of the complements which include their semantics, and that the argument structure is obtained by coindexing the semantic part of that description with the appropriate argument slot.","6In HPSG there is some ambiguity here, since the argument structure is embedded within the content part of the sign, where a lot of terminolgy is used that comes from situation semantics.","7In HPSG for example the representation for the for-met is strictly based on the coindexation between syntactic and argument values, whereas the treatment for the latter assumes an event structure for predication and in-tersects it with the optional adjunts (see Badia & Colominas"]},{"title":"(1996)).","paragraphs":["there is no way to introduce arguments (or other kind of slots) that are not induced syntactically (or grammatically) in a restrictive way. A full theory of lexical semantics is needed to do so in a consistent way. For example, in Badia (1997) a particular case is considered and solved in an ad hoc way: the nominal"]},{"title":"translation (as","paragraphs":["in 9b above) is said to have an extra argument (to those inherited from the verb) so that its result reading can have its denotation properly derived. This of course is only adequate for a small class of the complements we have here in mind (see examples in (8) and (9) above) and does not derive from a general theory of argument structure.","Such optional complements have only been treated in standard treatments by creating distinct lexical entries, where the omitted complement is either just not present in the argument structure representation or represented by an abstract existential quantification (without a correspondence to any syntactically realised element). However this treatment neither reflects the relation between the different lexical entries that exist for a single word, nor is adequate in avoiding lexical redundancy. An alternative op-tion that could be considered is to treat those complements as adjuncts. However the treatment of adjuncts has not been fully developed yet, so that most of the proposals at hand are only adequate for intersective adjuncts. 8","Furthermore, complements to nouns are particularly difficult. From a semantic (and argument structure) point of view many of them are like complements to verbs, in that they contribute entities to the relation denoted by the noun; thus an adequate treatment might introduce a particular number of arguments for every relation class denoted by nouns (just as it is done for verbs) (Badia & Colominas, 1996). But from the syntactic point of view the difficulty arises because they cannot be simply introduced in the valence lists (as verbal complements are). And a simple treatment as adjuncts is not very satisfactory either since it would increase the complexity of the semantic calculations.","8Non intersective adjuncts cannot be easily treated, particularly those that contribute a new entity involved in the relation denoted by the predicate (for some of them quite complex proposals have been developed within HPSG: e.g., Kaspers, 1994). 4 Proposed treatment In the following we attempt to account for some optional complements of predicative nouns in HPSG, by enlarging the semantic information and representing these complements in an information level distinct from the valence lists. With regards to our semantic representation proposal, we maintain the referential information level in HPSG, expressed by means of the INDEX attribute. However we follow Pustejovsky (1995) in enriching the argument structure information level (expressed in HPSG as the RESTRICTION attribute and adapted here as ARGUMENT-STRUCTURE (ARGSTR)), SO that D-and S-Args can be represented (in addition to the strictly obligatory ones). Furthermore we also introduce the EVENT-STRUCTURE (EVSTR) and QUALIA levels of information estipulated in Pustejovsky (1995). The latter describes the lexical semantics of the entity and its related arguments, whereas the former displays the event properties of the expressed eventuality. As will be seen below, the argument structure level acts as interface between the mechanisms that allow for the syntactic realisation of the complements and the rich lexical semantics -constituted by the EVSTR and QUALIA levels. 9","Let us now consider the syntactic treatment of D- and S-Args. Due to their optionality, the HPSG standard treatment of obligatory complements by means of valence lists is not adequate for them. Nonetheless a recent proposal by Sanfilippo (1998) gives a good insight into how they can be treated. For independent reasons he proposes that some complements are treated as real adjuncts from a syntactic point of view, even if they are thematically bound to the relation denoted by the head. We adopt this mechanism and represent D- and S-Args as thematically bound adjuncts, introduced as set members at the nonlocal"]},{"title":"(NONLOC)","paragraphs":["information level.

We first derive the process reading of the nominal from the verbal lexical entry: the nominal representation for the process reading (in figure 2) is obtained by (non-locally) inher-iting from the already existing lexical entry of the verb (in figure 1). 11 And secondly the lexical entry for the result sense of construcci6 is created by means of a lexical rule that replaces the EVSTR head value and removes the ARG2 attribute, the value of which is now declared as the index value. ARG2 has to be removed since, as it expresses the entity resulting from tribute in the rest of the structures in the paper.","nThis is expressable in LKB by using the verbal lexical entry as a pseudo-sort (psort) (see Copestake (1993:23)). ?,AT SEM \"HEAD verb","VALENCE [SUB,] COMPS \"INDEX [~]"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["'EVENT 1 EVENT2","EVSTR RESTR [HEAD LD-ARG3 QUALIA FORM AGEN [~] process\" [~] state E] [] anirnate-ind [] artifact [] material ARGI EVENT HEAD -- RELN constr-act\" ARGI [] ARG2 [] EVENT ED HEAD + NONLOC [ INHER [ SLASH"]},{"title":"{PP[]}","paragraphs":["Figure 1: construir the process of building, it cannot appear as an argument of the result noun itself, n","Thus the treatment of optional complements of nominalizations is identical to the treatment assigned to D-Ares of verbs.

To make things concrete we present in figure (4) the full lexical entry of the process reading of the nominal traduccid. This representation is able to deal with anaphoric reference to the unexpressed result semantic argument of the process reading (9b). Note that a parallel verbal lexical entry also gives an account of the anaphoric relation allowed by the verb traduir in (9c), and that a similar treatment is applicable to the verbs menjar and amanir of examples (5) and (9e).","Of course this treatment applies in a general way to other redescription predicates, like estudi ('study'), soluci6 ('solution') and avaluaci6 ('evaluation') in (8). Notice as well that the rich semantic information we use allows us to deal in a natural way with the distinction between subjective and objective complements in these data. In (Sa), for instance, estudi does not allow plantes ('plants') as the agent of the event since tha agent has to be an animate individual: 13","Other types of nouns with semantically implied (optional) complements can be similarly treated; for example non deverbal nouns that express a relation with another entity, like nouns denoting partition or sets (full 'sheet' in (2) and grup 'group' in (3)) or relational nouns (mare 'mother' in (9d)). The arguments of full or grup can be treated as D-Args because they are not strictly obligatory but their semantics is implied.
