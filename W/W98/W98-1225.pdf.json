The most obvious case in point is phrase structure. However, while the latter notion has shown its theoretical relevance in many ways, practical applications based on phrase structure description are not without problems. The main reason for this is the high flexibility of natural language. In performance data (i.e. actual language use), many disruptions of, and variations on standard phrase structure patterns occur. As a result, application of phrase structure-based parsers in natural language processing shows only limited success. This has inspired a search for alternative methods, such as statistical based or lexicon-driven parsing.","In our search for a solution to the problems mentioned we decided to take one step back, and examine the underlying nature of hierarchical structure in general, and phrase structure in particular. Our aim in doing so was to find a more principled solution to the problems of linguistic analysis and parsing. We looked for ways to derive structural information from input, and to incorporate this in a mathematically well-founded theory of knowledge representation. As a result we found a level of abstractness that, in principle, allows language-independent modelling and analysis.","In our approach we capitalise on the property that the information carriers, the lexical items, are 'will-ing' to combine. These combinatorial properties are determined by inherent characteristics of lexica/ items. Hierarchical structure follows naturally from the interaction of these properties, while leav-ing room for variation and flexibility in structural patterning.","In our model of natural language (NL) the input is represented as a binary relation. This is due to the dichotomy of language, meaning that a classification of lexical items as objects and attributes can be made (we use the term \"dichotomy\" in a restricted sense: a division into two mutually exclusive parts). The two classes are interrelated, and their relation can be dete ~rrnined merely on the basis of lexicai information and some general principles, like word order (e.g. SVO). The relation between the classes is due to the principle of relatedness. This principle entails that any non-empty set of objects implies the existence of a non-empty set of attributes (properties) it is related to, and vice versa. Minimally, an observable entity (object) has the property of existence (attribute). This principle gives rise to a relation representing the semantics of the 'thought' described by the sentence in terms of a set of related items, called observations. An observation captures a set of objects and properties that are mutually characteristic of each other. Such a notion corresponds to a/ormal concept in lattice theory. We will show that the above relation is supported by linguistic considerations.","Our approach to language, Natural Language Concept Analysis (NLCA), constitutes a linguistically and mathematically based theory. This is reflected by the different readings of the acronym, as follows.

Amongst other works, one can cite HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994), and most recently, a proposal by Berwick and Epstein (Berwick and Epstein, 1995).","Berwick and Epstein outline a model that, in accordance with Minimalist principles, does not posit \"any syntactic entities at all beyond what [is] absolutely necessary for linguistic description and ex- â€¢ planation.\" The necessary machinery, as they point out, is one based on categorial grammar (Lambek, 1988). Their argument follows from the fundamental idea that natural languages are limited to rules specifying how constituents can be concatenated to form larger constituents. Berwick and Epstein introduce a single syntactic operation, Hierarchical Com-position (HC), for the realization of such syntactic constraints.","With respect to the above mentioned movement in natural language processing, we note that the endeavour to move (almost) all information to the lexicon can be theoretically justified. Intuitively, practical NL formalisms like HPSG can be seen as variants of two-level, e.g. attribute grammars. Theoretically, for such a grammar, a weakly equivalent grammar using only a single nonterminal symbol exists (Franzen, 1983). In such a grammar all structural information is specified by attribute functions. These functions can be defined by the lexicon. 2 A supporting theory Natural language modelling usually assumes some form of hierarchical structure as given. Experience shows that practical application of such an approach to a non-trivial subset of the language can be a highly complex task (Aarts, 1991). In our search for a more flexible basis we arrived at the question: How does phrase and clause structure emerge in natural language? It appeared that this question is related to a more general one: How can knowledge about real world be structured?","We found a philosophical background in C.S. Peirce's pragmatism (Peirce, 1931) and a mathematical formalisation of Peirce's ideas in R. Wille's theory on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) Wille, 1982). Relatedness, for example, relies on Peirce's epistemological argument saying that \"... there is no judgment of pure observation without reasoning' (Houser and Kloesel, 1992). This means that an observation is always tied to \"judgment\"; in other words, in our case, observation of an object always implies the presence of an attribute, and some interpretation of their relation.","In the FCA framework, observable world is described by a binary relation between the sets of objects and attributes. These sets give a dichotomous characterisation of observable entities, and together with their relation formalise Peirce's universal categories: firstness, secondness and thirdness. These are defined as follows: \"The first is that whose be-hag is simply in itself, not referring to anything nor lying behind anything. The second is that which is what it is by force of something to which it is second. The third is that which is what it is owing to things between which it mediates and which it brings into relation to each other\" (Houser and Kloesel, 1992).","For the time being we adopt the interpretation of Lehmann and Wille (Lehmann and Wille, 1995) who state that \"the object g is a [f]irst ... to which the attribute m is a [s]econd...\". According to Lehmann and Wille, this interpretation is compatible with Peirce's general understanding of firstness and secondness.","In FCA, observations, or concepts, are mathematically formalised. Traditionally, the philosophical notion of a concept is determined by its extension and its intension. The extension consists of all elements (set of objects) belonging to the concept while the intension covers all properties (set of attributes) valid for all those elements.","In the mathematical model, the triple consisting of the sets, objects (G; Gegenst~tnde) and attributes (M; Merkmale), and the relation between them (R), is called the context (we assume that G and M are finite sets). We say, for g E G, m E M, (g, m) E R or equivalently, (gRin), iff the object g has the attribute m.","For a context the following mappings are defined: A' = {m e M I gRrn for all g e A} for A C_ G; and B' = {ge G I gRrnforallme B} forB C M. A (formal) concept of a context (G, M, R) is a pair (A,B) with A C G, B C M, which satisfies the conditions (i) A' = B and (ii) A = B'.","Informally, A ~ is calculated from A by considering the elements of A and accumulating the properties common to them all. B' is calculated dually. We say (A, B) is a concept if, by the above calculation, A and B mutually determine each other.","For any concepts (A1,Bt) and (A2,B2) of a con-"]},{"title":"1 II 1 1 II II II II 1 1 il II","paragraphs":["Karaphuis and Sarbo 206 Natural Language Concept Analysis"]},{"title":"II II II II II II","paragraphs":["tex~ the"]},{"title":"hierarchy of concepts","paragraphs":["is captured by the definition: (A1,B1) <"]},{"title":"(A2,B2) iffA1 C A2","paragraphs":["(or equivalently, iff B1 _D B2).

Functor-argument relations, the manifestations of the (combinatorial) properties of lexical items, have various realizations on the linguistic level. For example, the verb-complement relation is not the same as the relation of modifica-tion. This becomes clear when we look at the optionality of modifiers. In English, we cannot say, on the basis of encountering a noun, that it needs an adjectival modifier; however, when we encounter an adjective, we do know that at some level it needs a noun because it is a semantic predicate (functor) taking an argument of which it is predicated. In this case, then, there is an asymmetrical relation between functor and argument. On the other hand, the relation between a verb and its complementation is a symmetrical one.","In NLCA, we distinguish between two kinds of relations: major and minor.

In English, major predicates (usually) relate to the noun-verb division; minor predicates do not. Major predicates are typically realized by verbs; minor predicates by adjectives and adverbs. There is never more than one major predicate associated with an argument; there may be several minor predicates related to the same argument. (This reflects the possibility of having zero or more modifiers of an action or participant.) Both major and minor predicates can provide semantic roles, but major predicates introduce participant roles for their arguments; minor predicates can introduce additional roles (such as location or manner) or properties of their arguments.","The second type of relation, the"]},{"title":"minor relation, or","paragraphs":["qualification, distinguishes between the core content of a linguistic expression and some qualification of it. At the level of an action and its participants, for example, this qualification may relate to referential status of NPs (e.g. definite vs. indefinite article), or to tense and aspect information at clause level. Intensifying adverbs (e.g."]},{"title":"very, extremely, deeply)","paragraphs":["and comparative adverbs (e.g."]},{"title":"more and most)","paragraphs":["also belong to the class of qualifiers. These examples suggest that qualification may also have a symmetrical and asymmetrical variant: article, tense, aspect etc. being of the first type, and intensifying and comparative adverbs of the second. However, this is still an object of further study. In this paper we will restrict ourselves to the distinction between qualifier and core in general.","The difference between a minor predicate and a qualifier is that the latter does not introduce a meaning that is independent of the element it qualifies. 2 The presence of a qualifier of a specific type, therefore, also signals the presence of its counterpart. Furthermore, there can be several modifiers associated with an argument or predicate; typically, how-ever, there will only be a single (possibly composite) quali~er. In the case of referential information, for instance, the qualifier situates the argument or predicate in its referential context of which there will only be one. In some cases different aspects of the","2By contrast, a minor predicate has some aspect of meaning that is independent of the element it combines with. This is illustrated by the fact that minor predicates can be used in different contexts. For example, a prepositional phrase can modify an argument (e.g. noun) but also a predicate (e.g. verb). An adjective phrase can be used as a modifier of a noun, but also in the complemenration of a verb."]},{"title":"Kamphuis and Sarbo","paragraphs":["207"]},{"title":"Natural Language Concept Analysis","paragraphs":["qualifier can be expressed separately (such as tense and aspect); in that case these different aspects must be unifiable but there cannot be more than a single qualifier relating to the same domain.","The qualifier evokes its COUnterpart; nevertheless, the semantic 'core' is also complete in itself, in that it forms a full account of semantic relationships. Therefore it does not require realization of the qualifier as such: cf. the use of such bare relations in captions or telegram style speech (e.g. \"Lion attacked woman.t\" ).","Summing up, we distinguish between the following relations: â€¢ major predication â€¢ minor predication â€¢ qualification.","A schematic representation of these possibilities is given in Fig. 1."]},{"title":"/","paragraphs":["Minor relation: Qualification"]},{"title":"/ \\","paragraphs":["Qualifier Core Linguistic relations"]},{"title":"\\","paragraphs":["Major relation: Predication"]},{"title":"/ \\","paragraphs":["Major predication Minor predication (symmetrical) (asymmetrical)"]},{"title":"/ \\ / \\","paragraphs":["Major Argu- Minor Argu-predicate ment(s) predicate meat Figure 1: Inventory of linguistic relations in NLCA","It is important to note that this diagram does not represent the hierarchical structure of sentences, or the organisation of conceptual content within the sentence (we will come back to this below); it merely shows the different types of relations that our approach identifies. These relations lie at the heart of structure formation in NL. How phrase structure emerges as a result of their interaction is explained in Sect. 6.","As mentioned, the different relations can be recursively nested. For example, at the level of argument, a modifying predicate may be added in the form of an adjective phrase, or a qualifier may be present in the form of a determiner. Each element that is added stands in a certain relation to its counterpart, based on the type of relation that was applied.","There is a potential mapping between the linguistic relations displayed in Fig. 1 and the hierarchical organisation of information structure. For example, it is likely that the major predication relation is the most important information carrier with respect to the semantic content of the sentence, and that the minor predication relation reflects additional information of less importance. This illustrates the rela-tive contribution of the different linguistic relations to information content. In information retrieval this could help to generate a concise representation of retrieved text. It would also be in line with the use, already mentioned, of the major predication relation in captions or telegram style speech; furthermore, it could be a possible explanation for the ability of speed-reading that readers may develop.","The qualification gives concrete reference to all the items involved in the predication relation, and as such is relevant for all levels. The presence of the qualifier at all levels of representation is a matter of some importance: word order, for instance, may also be classified as part of the qualification relation (e.g. in English, word order is relevant for identifyhag questions, and also in assigning thematic roles to participants). The relationship between qualifiers in NLCA, and operators in the semantically based hierarchy of Role and Reference Grammar (Van Volin~ 1993) would be a potentially useful area to investigate. 4 A first sketch of the model The distinctions made above have been incorporated into the NLCA-model on the basis of the abstraction of FCA: the context. In the dyadic model of FCA, a context allows only two kinds of entities: object and attribute. Therefore, each lexical item has:to be classifted as one these, based on its lexical type. Typical objects are nouns; typical attributes are verbs (major predicates), and adjectives and adverbs (minor predicates). We refer to these attributes uniformly as major attributes (involving predication). Qualifiers are classified as attributes, as well. We call them minor attributes (involving qualification).","A comment with respect to the classification of lexical items and its relation to Peirce's universal categories is in place. We mentioned that objects and attributes formalise the categories firstness and secondiaess. Each item of these classes may evoke a different relation (called interpretant) depending on the item's syntactic and semantic properties, and in general, the properties of the item as a sign (Liszka, 1996)..In NLCA these interpretants are instantiations of the linguistic relations formalising the category of thirdness.

The set of lexical types defines a partition of L, the set of lexical items and semantic roles involved in the analysis, which is further partitioned according to the dyadic model, yielding the sets G and M. From G C_ L and M C L follows that there is an embedding of the relation R C G x M in L x L. This means that any pair (g, m) E R can be defined as the unique yield of 11 and l~ (ll, 12 E L) by the assignments ll ~ g and 12 ~-r m, where ~ respects the mapping of lexical types.","As said above, each lexical item is classified according to its type.

Since qualifiers contain a specific type of information, they can be regarded as a syntactic pointer to the qualified element itself: if this domain of the internal argument is filled, there must also be an object/attribute of the type that the internal argument belongs to.

First, it does not require ambiguous lexical entries. The same can be said for demonstrative pronouns, numerals and other function words that are ambiguous between independent and adjectival use. Second, the use of Proto-objects makes it unnecessary to have a rule defining noun phrase heads as realized either by nouns, or by numerals, quantifying pronouns, demonstrative pronouns etc. In fact, this also applies to nominal adjective phrases: there is no need to define adjectives as possible realizations of noun phrase heads. The nominal adjective phrase follows naturally from the presence of the article (creating the Proto-object) and the adjective (combining with the Proto-object).

The concept C3 denotes the observation that 'girl' and 'flower(s)' are related to the action 'buy(PAST)'. It is interesting that these concepts correspond to the focus of WH-questions: (C1) Who bought (something)? (C3) What happened? This suggests a potential correspondence between the linguistic device of question-formation and the information reflected in the lattice. More-over, it exemplifies the postulate (Sarbo, 1997) that a concept lattice is an appropriate representation for what is referred to in artificial intelligence as 'cooperative communication' (Grice, 1975).","In addition to the individual concepts, a (sub)lattice also has information content, comparable to that of a clause. In this example, C0-C1-C2-C3 represents the clause. The use of sublattices is potentially relevant for interpreting discourse relations. 7 Summary and conclusions In this paper we have focused on the underlying principles of hierarchical structure in language. We have discussed the theoretical foundations of Natural Language Concept Analysis. We have shown that hierarchical structure, which is commonly taken as given in linguistics, emerges as the result of more abstract principles relating to the combinatorial properties of linguistic units of different types. These properties derive from the inherent characteristics of lexical items and the different linguistic relations that they can take part in. The major relation, predication, has a symmetrical instantiation (predicate-participants) and an asymmetrical instantiation (predicate/participant-modifier). The minor relation distinguishes between semantic core and a qualification of that core. The application of NLCA was illustrated on the basis of examples. Current research on NLCA focuses on an elabora-tion of the linguistic and philosophical foundations on the one hand and algorithmic implementation on the other.
