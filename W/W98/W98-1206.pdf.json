This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the effect of different tree representations for PP attachment on PCFG models, and introduces a new methodology for empirically examin-ing such effects using tree transformations. It shows that one transformation, which copies the label of a parent node onto the labels of its children, can improve the performance of a PCFG model in terms of labelled precision and recall on held out data from 73% (precision) and 69% (recall) to 80% and 79% respectively. It also points out that if only maximum likelihood parses are of interest then many productions can be ignored, since they are subsumed by combinations of other productions in the grammar. In the Penn II tree bank grammar, almost 9% of productions are subsumed in this way. 1 Introduction Parsers which are capable of analysing unrestricted text are of considerable scientific interest, and have technological applications in areas such as machine translation and information retrieval as well. One way to produce such a parser is to extract a grammar from one of the larger tree bank corpora currently available.","The relative frequency estimator described below provides a simple way to estimate from a tree bank corpus a Probabalistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG) that generates Part Of","I would like to thank Chris Manning, whose observa-tion that PCFG parsers do not accurately reproduce PP attachment preferences in their training data stimulated this work, as well as Eugene Charniak, Stuart Geman and our students at Brown. Speech (POS) tags. Such a PCFG induced from a sufficiently large corpus typically generates all possible POS tag strings. A parsing system can be obtained by using a parser to find the maximum likelihood parse tree for an input string. Such parsing systems often perform as well as other broad coverage parsing systems for predicting tree structure from POS tags (Charniak, 1996). In addition, many more sophisticated parsing models are elaborations of such PCFG models, so understanding the properties of PCFGs is likely to be useful (Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1997).","It is well-known that natural language exhibits dependencies that Context Free Grammars (CFGs), and hence PCFGs, cannot describe (Shieber, 1985). But as explained below, the independence assumptions implicit in PCFGs introduce biases in the statistical model induced from a tree bank even in constructions which are adequately described by a CFG. The direction and size of these biases depend on factors such as the following:","• the precise tree structures used in the tree bank, and","• whether the set of well-formed trees according to the linguistic model used to assign trees to strings can be described with a CFG.","This paper explains how such biases can arise, and presents a series of experiments in which the trees of a tree bank corpus are systematically transformed to other tree structures to obtain a grammar used for parsing, and the inverse tree Johnson 39 The effect of alternative tree representations Mark Johnson (1998) The effect of alternative tree representations on tree bank grammars.

One of the transformations described here improves the average labelled precision and recall on held out data from 73% (precision) and 69% (recall) to 80% and 79% respectively.","2 Probabalistic Context Free Grammars A PCFG is a CFG in which each production A ~ a in the grammar's set of productions R is associated with an emission probability P(A a) that satisfies a normalization constraint","y~ P(A~a) = 1 ~:A--+c~ER and a consistency or tightness constraint not discussed here.","A PCFG defines a probability distribution over the (finite) parse trees generated by the grammar, where the probability of a tree T is given by","P(T) = H P(A ~ o0 Cr(A'~a) A.-+o~ER where C~(A --+ a) is the 'count' of the local tree consisting of a parent node labelled A with a sequence of immediate children nodes labelled a in r, or equivalently, the number of times the production A ~ a is used in the derivation ~-.","The PCFG which assigns maximum likelihood to a tree bank corpus ~ is given by the relative frequency estimator.","Pe(A ~ a) = C~(A --+ a) ~a':A~a'eR C~(A -~ a') Here C÷(A -+ a) refers to the 'count' of the local tree in the tree bank, or equivalently, the number of times the production A -+ a would be used in derivations of exactly the trees in ~.","It is practical to induce PCFGs from tree bank corpora and find maximum likelihood parses for such PCFGs using relatively modest computing equipment. All the experiments reported here used the Penn II Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus, modified as described by Charniak (Charniak, 1996), i.e., empty nodes were deleted, and all other components of nodes labels except syntactic category were removed.","Grammar induction or training used the 39,832 trees in the F2-21 sections of the Penn II WSJ corpus, and testing was performed on the 1,576 sentences of length 40 or less of the F22 section of the corpus. Parsing was performed using an exhaustive CKY parser that returned a maximum likelihood parse. Ties between equally likely parses were broken randomly; on the tree bank grammar this leads to fluctuations in labelled precision and recall with a standard deviation of approximately 0.07%.","3 Different tree structure representations of adjunction There is considerable variation in the tree structures used in the linguistic literature to represent various linguistic constructions. In this paper we focus on variations in the representation of adjunction constructions, particularly PP adjunction, but similiar variation occurs in other constructions as well.","Early analyses in transformational grammar typically adopted a 'flat' representation of adjunction structures in which adjuncts are represented as siblings of the phrasal head, as shown in Figure 1. This representation does not systematically distinguish between adjuncts and arguments, as both are attached as children of a single maximal projection.","The Penn II tree bank represents PP adjunction to VP in this manner, presumably because it permits the annotators to avoid having to determine whether the PP in question is an adjunct or an argument.","Because this representation attaches all of the adjuncts modifying the same phrase to the same node, distinct CFG productions are required for each possible number of adjuncts. Thus the set of all possible trees following this representation scheme can only be generated by a CFG if one imposes an upper bound on the number of PPs that can be adjoined to any one single phrase, but according to standard linguistic wisdom there is no natural bound on the number of PPs that may be adjoined to a single phrase.

If these relationships are significant then a PCFG will be a poor language model. Indeed, the sense in which the set of trees generated by a CFG is \"context free\" is precisely that the label on a node completely characterizes the relationships between the subtree dominated by the node and the set of nodes that properly dominate this subtree.","Thus one way of relaxing the independence assumptions implicit in a PCFG model is to systematically encode more information in node labels about their context. This subsection explores a particularly simple kind of contextual encoding: the label of the parent of each non-root nonpreterminal node is appended to that node's label. The labels of the root node and the terminal and preterminal nodes are left unchanged.","For example, assuming that the Penn II for-mat trees (A1) and (B1) of subsection 4.1 are immediately dominated by a node labelled S, this relabelling applied to those trees produces the trees (A3) and (B3) below.","(A3) VpAs V~NAVp Np~'p'N̂p (Ba) VPŜ ~AVp Det N P NP PP","We can perform the same theoretical analysis on this two tree corpus that we applied to the previous corpora to investigate the effect of this relabelling on the PCFG modelling of PP attachment structures.","The counts C3 and the non-unit production probability estimates P3 for the PCFG induced from this two-tree corpus are as follows: VpAs -+ V NPAVP f VpAS--rVNpAVpPPAVP 1-f 1 f NpAVp --+ Det N 1 - f 1 - f NpAvp -+ NpANp ppANp f f","The estimated likelihoods using P3 of the tree structures (A3) and (B3) are:","= 12 #3(B3) = (1 - f)2","As in the previous subsection P3(A3) < f and P3(B3) < (1 - f).

On reflec-tion, perhaps this should not be surprising. The Chomsky adjunction representations are motivated within the theoretical framework of Transformational Grammar, which explicitly argues for nonlocal, indeed, non context free, dependencies. Thus its poor performance when used as input to a statistical model which is insensitive to such dependencies is to be expected. Indeed, it might be the case that the additional adjunction nodes inserted in the tree transformations above have the effect of converting a local dependency (which can be described by a PCFG) into a nonlocal dependency (which cannot).","Another initially surprising property of the tree sequences produced by the PCFGs is that they do not reflect at all well the frequency of the different kinds of PP attachment found in the Penn II corpus. This is in fact to be expected, since the sequences consist of maximum likelihood parses. To see this, consider any of the examples analysed in section 4. In all of these cases, the corpora contained two tree structures, and the induced PCFG associates each with an estimated likelihood. If these likelihoods differ, then a maximum likelihood parser will always return the same maximum likelihood tree structure each time it is presented with its yield, and will never return the tree structure with lower likelihood, even though the PCFG assigns it a nonzero likelihood.","Thus the surprising fact is that these PCFG parsers ever produce a nonzero number of NP attachments and VP attachments in the same tree sequence.

Since these productions are never used to construct a maximum likelihood parse, ':they can be ignored if only maximum likelihood parses are required. 7 Conclusion There may be several ways of representing a particular linguistic construction as a tree. Because of the independence assumptions implicit in a PCFG, the kind of tree representation employed can have a dramatic impact on the quality of the PCFG model induced. This paper introduces a new methodology for examining these effects utilitizing tree transformations, and showed that one transformation, which copies the label of a parent node onto the labels of its children, can dramatically improve the performance of a PCFG model in terms of labelled precision and recall. It also pointed out that if only maximum likelihood parses are of-interest then many productions can be ignored, since they are subsumed by combinations of other productions in the grammar.
