The distinctive aspect of the formalism is the presence of non-lexical (trace - ~) nodes in the representation. We illustrate the basic mechanisms, and how they can account for syntactic phenomena involving long-distance dependencies. Then, we see how the same mechanism can account for the gaps and ellipses of coordination constructs. 1. Introduction Coordination is a long standing problem for linguistic theories, because of its particular aspects which do not fit well with the dominance-based character of the vast majority of paradigms. The accounts of coordination which have been devised in constituency theories all rely on the notion of non traditional constituents, because of the variety of word strings that can play the role of conjuncts (see, for example, (Gazdar et al. 1985)). Maybe the most natural description has been provided by Steedman in a series of papers on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (Steedman 1985, 1990, 1996).

In this way, they are able to keep unaltered the notion of fixed constituency due to LTAG lexicon.","Dependency paradigms exhibit obvious difficulties with coordination because, differently from most linguistic structures, it is not possible to characterize the coordination construct with a general schema involving a head and some modifiers of it. The conjunction itself, has distributional properties that have nothing to do with the whole coordination. Hudson (1990, following Tesniere 1959) gives up the idea of providing a dependency structure for the coordination, and characterizes conjuncts as word strings. Conjuncts are internally organized as (possibly disconnected) dependency structures and each conjunct root is dependency related to some element of the sentence which is external to the coordination.","Mel'cuk (1988), on the other hand, privileges one of the two conjuncts as the head of the coordination, and claims that coordination symmetry is such only at the semantic level. This approach solves the problem of providing a head with the same distributional properties of the whole coordination. When applied to English, it allows to represent the prepositional character of conjunctions observed by Ross (1970).","In this work we provide a dependency account of coordination following Mel'cuk's hint: one of the two conjuncts is the head of the construction, and the conjunction itself is the head of the other conjunct. We extend the lexicalized dependency formalism presented in (Lombardo, Lesmo 1998): each rule constrains the form and the number of dependents of a word in a dependency tree (see fig. 1).","The formalism is projective, and accounts for long-distancedependency phenomena 11"]},{"title":"I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I","paragraphs":["through the introduction of non lexical categories, which can be viewed as a notational variant of some graph structures already present in some formalisms (see, e.g., Word Grammar (Hudson 1990)).

Intuitively, a dependency rule constrains one node (head) and its dependents in a dependency tree3: the d-quad sequence states the order of elements, both the head (# position) and the dependents (d-quads). The grammar is lexicalized, because each dependency rule has a lexical anchor in its head (x:X). A d-quad <riYiuixi> identifies a dependent of category Yi, connected with the head via a dependency relation ri. Each element of the d-quad sequence is possibly associated with a u-index (ui) and a set of u-triples (xi). The x-component can be viewed as a slash feature in GPSG terms. Both ui and zi can be null elements, i.e. 0 and ®, respectively. A u-triple (x-component of the d-quad) <u, R, Y> bounds the area of the dependency tree where the trace can occur. The principle of u-triple satisfiability states a one-to-one correspondence between the u-indices and the u-triples of the d-quads.

Coordination in English In section 2 we have described a lexicalized dependency formalism and a notion of derivation that yields the legal sentences and the corresponding dependency trees. In (Lombardo, Lesmo 1998) we have defined an Earley-type parsing algorithm for this formalism. In this section we address the problem of providing a dependency analysis of coordination constructs. The (non primitive) dependency rules that account for coordination are the result of the application of metarules to basic dependency rules. Metarules and primitive dependency rules express the linguistic knowledge. The iterated application of metarules produces all the non primitive dependency rules, that together with the primitive rules, form the grammar. The application of the derivation rules to the complete set of rules produces the sentences of the language.

In our work, the final goal is to associate metarules to subcategories arranged in a hierarchy (on this topic, see (Barbero et al., this volume)). In this paper, we neglect this point, and all our examples of melarules assume category-headed patterns. the corresponding PATrERN that accounts for extracting the object from the sentential complement.

Gapped constituent coordination results from the same mechanism that accounts for long-distance dependencies in section 2. The treatment of coordination illustrated here pursues the goal of providing a dominance-based representation. As we will see, this can lead sometimes to less standard analyses of coordination phenomena. Most of the theories in the literature assume a parallel constituency-based (Steedman 1996) (Sarkar, Joshi 1997) or string-based (Hudson 1990) analyses of the conjuncts. This prevents a fully incremental processing of the input, since before processing the infix conjunction (and, or .... ) we need to analyze the second conjunct. The theory illustrated here naturally favors the incremental analysis.","As the formalism is lexicalized, coordinating conjunctions are treated as lexically ambiguous elements (polymorphic functors in categorial terms): they are assigned the categories of the form CONJ-X, for each syntactic category X.

The linguistic knowledge is formalized in primitive dependency rules and a number of metarules, which produce non primitive rules from primitive rules. Long-distance dependencies are represented by coindexing lexical and non lexical nodes in the dependency tree. Metarules can generate the non primitive rules that license long distance dependencies and, in particular, those connected with coordination gapped constructs.","The paper gives an account of pair coordinations, but the formalism seems to be generalizable to any number of conjuncts. The basic conjunct unit is the predicate-argument structure including adjuncts. This assumption leads to the broad classification in unit and gapped coordinations. As we have seen, this can caused some non standard analyses of Right Node Raising and verb coordination.","The formalism presented in this paper is only a first attempt of producing a dependency formalism that can account for coordination without resurging to phrase structure augmentations or string-based representations. The formalism is thus suitable to left-to-right incremental processing, because of the dominance-based character of the representation. We are aware that the formalism is weak on the linguistic competence, because it probably overgenerates with respect to legal sentences; however, we believe that the formal tools introduced (constraints on the u-triple satisfaction) can be successfully used to eliminate this problem. This paper has benefited from comments of the people at a seminar held by one of the authors at IRCS, UPenn, Philadelphia.","References","Barbero C., Lesmo L., Lombardo V., Merlo P., Integration of syntactic and lexical information in a hierarchical dependency gratmnar, this volume.","Gazdar G., Klein E., Pullum G., Sag I., Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar, Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1985.","Huang X., Dealing with conjunctions in a machinetranslation environment, Proc. of COLING 84, pp. 243-246.","Hudson R., English Word Granunar, Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1990.","Lombardo V., Lesmo L., Formal aspects and parsing issues of dependency theory, in Proc. of ACL/COLING 98.","Mel'cuk I., Dependency Syntax: Theory and Practice, SUNY Press, Albany, 1988.","Neuhaus P., Broker N., The Complexity of Recognition of Linguistically Adequate Dependency Granunars, Proc.
