In order to get to some place we use private means or public transportation, and if we lack clear directions we tend to ask for help. We will deal in this paper with the descriptions of subway routes and their automatic generation. In particular, we will try to show how the relative importance of a given piece of information can effect not only the message but also the form."]},{"title":"1 Introduction: the problem","paragraphs":["A frequently encountered •problem in urban life is the use of •public transportation: we have to get from here to there and quite so often we dori't know how. As it is not always possible to get help from a person (be it because nobody is available, or able to speak our language), we might appreciate assistance of a machine.","In order to convey to the user \"useful information\", we must define what \"usefulness\" means. For example, if we •tell someone how to get from one place to another, we hardly ever specify all the intermediate steps, in particular if there is no ambiguity. Also, not all information is of equal weight. Yet, as we •will show ' the notion of \"relative importance\" of information is gradual in nature • rather than discrete , that is a simple binary Value (important vs. unimportant) 1.","• All this reflects, of course, in the content and form of the final text. Relative importance is signaled by different means at the text level (headers, paragraphs, etc.) and at the sentence level (word choice, •syntactic structure: main clause versus subordinate clause, topic-comment •structures).","• Concerning the prominence status (i.e. relative importance of a piece of information), semioticians and text linguists have reached a similar conclusion by distinguishing between the 'Yoreground/background\" or \"primary/secondary level\" of a text [Bar66, vD77, AP89, Com92]. According to Combettes [Com92], the \"primary level\" deals with the core meaning, i.e. events and facts that make the text progress, while th e \"secondary level\" deaIs •with descriptions, evaluations, comments, and:reformulati0ns. \" . -- ~: \" i ~. : : :","The distinction of levels, with information Of varying shades (salience gradation), implies that it should be possible to identify corresponding linguistic \"markers\" for each one of them.

This is particularly true for certain syntactic devices such as subordinate clauses, appositions, nominalization, all of which are, according to Combettes, markers of the secondary level, unlike main clauses which mark the primary level.","Analyzing a corpus of route descriptions in French we have identified correlations between the salience status of specific conceptua ! chunks (landmarks, segment distance, etc.) and linguistic structures (independent vs. subordinate clauses). In section 2, we will reveal how the salience status of some types of information may affect the content and form of the final text. In section 3 we will illustrate our use of these data in a generator of subway route descriptions."]},{"title":"2 A case study: subway route descriptions","paragraphs":["Route descriptions are interesting for at least two reasons: first of all, as navigation aids in general they help to solve a real world problem; second, despite their apparent simplicity, especially with regard to surface form, they require the solution of a number of non trivial linguistic and discourse problems, problems which are intimately rooted in human cognition,","Our analysis is based on a corpus containing 30 subway route descriptions in French. The data were collected from ten subjects via e-mail. Each one of them had to describe three routes in the Parisian subway. These routes differ in terms of length and complexity. The first route involves 9 stops and one transfer. It is the longest. The second one contains 4 stops and no transfer. It is the simplest. The third route, though very short (4 stops), is the most complex one as it involves two transfers. 2.1 Analysis of the underlying content The information contained in subway route descriptions can be divided into two broad categories: \"global\" and \"local\" information. We describe each one of them below, illustrating particular information types with examples taken from the corpus. Global information:","• identification of the route by specifying departure and destination, eg. Po~r aller de Saint-Lazare 5 Jussieu... / To go from Saint-Lazare to Jussieu...","• comments concerning the complexity of the whole route, eg. C'est simple et rapide, pas de changement. / It's simple and fast, no transfer.","• information concerning the distance of the whole trip, eg. ~a doit faire 7 ou 8 stations en tout. / This should make 7 or 8 stops for the whole trip. Local information: • stop of departure, eg. ii partir de Jussieu, tu prends... / Starting from Jussieu, you take...\" • destination, eg. tu arrives h Gate de Lyon / you arrive at Gate de Lyon o • lines to take, eg. prendre Ia ligne 5 / take the line number 5 • transfers, eg. changer h Opdra / change at Opera • directions to take, eg. tu prends la direction Gallieni / you take the direction Gallieni • partial distances to cover, eg. il y a une seule station /there is only one stop"]},{"title":"59 ~'","paragraphs":["According to Wunderlich and Reinelt [WR82], \"local information\" is the core of route descriptions, while \"global information\" is additional as it serves mainly interactional purposes. • In the remainder of our analysis we will concentrate on the \"local route information\" and the way it is expressed in the domain of subway route descriptions, the objective being to determine whether some information is obligatory or not. Of course, we could have defined on a priori grounds what","\\",".","• • should be mentioned explicitly and what not. Yet, we preferred to ground our work on empmcal data.","We assume that \"obligatory information\" is information that is contained in all descriptions of the corpus, whereas \"optional information\" occurs only occasionally 2.

On the other hand.: decisions concerning \"new\" information do involve conceptual choices.

Their function is to convey information of primary importance. Our analysis of the corpus Shows that independent clauses are mostly used in order to convey \"obligatory\" information, namely information specifying the names of the stations where to get off and directions to take. This is the case in example 1 below 3, where only these two chunks of information are contained in the independent clauses. Ex. 1 ,~ Saint-Lazare, prendre la direction GaIlieni. Descendre ~ Opdra (deux stations plus loin). Ps'endre alors la direction Mairie d'lvry/Villejuif jusqu'~ Jussieu (7-~me station). At Saint-Lazare, take the direction Gallieni (two stops ahead). Then take the direction Mairie d'lvry/Villejuif until Jussieu (Tth stop).","However, independent clauses may also convey optional information. Ill this case, we consider it as a way of signaling prominence. For example, in our corpus there are cases where a \"one-stop distance\" (distance being optional information) is expressed by an independent clause: Ex. 2 A Bastille, prendre le m~tro n 1 direction Chhteau de Vincennes et descendre & la prochaine station qui est la Gate de Lyon. At Bastille, take the line number 1, direction Chateau de Vincennes, and get off at the next stop which is Gare de Lyon,","Tile names of the lines (optional information), together with information concerning tile direction (obligatory information), are also quite frequently mentioned in independent clauses (see example 3). Again, we consider this as a sign for signaling high prominence: Ex. 3 A Saint-Lazare , prendre la ligne 3 direction Gallieni et changer h Opera. Prendre ensuite la iigne 7 direction Mairie d'Ivry et descendre h Jussieu. At Saint kazare, take the line 3 direction Gallieni and change at Opera. Then, take the line 7 direction Mairie d'lvry and get off at Jussieu.","Subordinate structures are generally used to convey optional information or information of minor importance. This is in our case information concerning partial distances and names of lines. In example 4 below, the information concerning partial distance is included only for the last segment, which is expressed by an \"anaphoric clause\". Example 5illustrates a strategy whereby prominence of the names of the lines is decreased: they are expressed in bracketed appositions.","Ex. 4 A Saint-Lazare prendre le m~tro n 3 direction Gallieni, changer b. OPera et prendre le m~tro n 7 direction Mairie d'Ivry/Villejuif et descendre ~t Jussieu (c'est la 7-~me station). At Saint-Lazare take the number 3, direction Gallienl, change at Opera and take the number 7 direction Mairie d'lvry/Villejuif anti get off at Jussieu (it's the 7th stop). Ex. 5 Prendre direction Gallieni (ligne 3). Sortir b. Opera (2 stations). Prendre direction Mairie d'Ivry (ligne 7). Descendre h Jussieu (7-~me station).
