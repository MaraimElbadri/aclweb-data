Development of such a capability for Arabic involved meeting some new challenges.","Like other Semitic writing systems, Arabic does not exhibit differences in orthographic case. Un-","1 \"Named entity recognition\" is meant in the sense familiar from the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC) and the Muhilingual Entity Task (MET). It refers to the identification and categorizing by type in unformatted text of names of persons, entities, and locations, as well as of numerics such as percentages and times/dates. In the following, we use \"name\" loosely in the same sense.","2 This work has been funded by the Department of Defense, Contract No. MDA904-97-C-3065."]},{"title":"like in English-language mixed-case texts, therefore, there is no obvious clue such as initial capitalized letters","paragraphs":["to indicate the presence of a name constituent. In our experience with Thai and other non-case writing systems, this seems to effectively impose a requirement that there be some understanding of the morphological nature of each token -- especially part-of-speech information. Having some morphological information allows one to make distinctions between likely and unlikely name constituents, which is particularly important when deciding where a name ends and the non-name context begins.","We partially motivate this for Arabic as follows: 3","• Closed-class items are rarely, if ever, part of an Arabic proper name: [Hasan f% with a preposition in second position, seems an unlikely Arabic name. 4","• Inflected forms of verbs are rarely part of proper names: [yata9allamu], \"he learns,\" is not a permissible name constituent. 5","• Many lexical items, of course, are not used, or highly unlikely to be used, in proper names: verbs of speaking or cognition, for example, do not appear to occur in names and they do not frequently overlap in appearance with proper name constituents: [muHammad qultu] is an unlikely name.","• Items with subject or object suffixes are rarely, if ever, part of names: [yukaatibuhu], \"He will correspond with him.

We will discuss this in more detail be-low in Section 4. 2 System Description Figure 1 contains the architecture of TAGARAB.","Our system has two major modules: a Morphological Tokenizer and a Name Finder. The Morphological Tokenizer has the ability, in addition to performing lexical scanning that establishes word-level units, to add morphological features to tokens. Text encoded in ISO-8859-6 is first passed through this tokenizer and then the tokenized stream is processed by the Name Finder module which identifies names and other extraction targets and annotates the text with appropriate SGML tags for each extracted item. 2.1 Morphological Tokenlzer 2.1.1 Description The Morphological Tokenizer's basic task is to identify the sequences of words, punctuation symbols, numbers, existing SGML tags, etc., that comprise the input text. For each such \"token,\" a description of what it has found is returned as a vector of up to 32 application-definable bits (e.g., PUNCTUATION, WORD, NUMBER). The Tokenizer is a very fast program, generated using the Flex scannergenerator from a tokenizer specification.","We decided to augment the tokenizer's usual role. While it still finds numbers and punctuation tokens, it treats an Arabic word (a contiguous sequence of Arabic letters) as a collection of one or more morpheme tokens, each with its own bit-vector of properties. The properties include those listed above, as well as morphology-specific properties whose nature and linguistic motivation is discussed in the next section.","Making the morphological analysis part of tokenization has the advantage of maintaining the high speed of SRA's TurboTag. An external morphology module -- with a high computation overhead -- would degrade performance.","Table 1 contains the features identified by the tokenizer.","Each token in the text receives some subset of the lexical types in Table 1. For example, a string such as"]},{"title":"$rbh,","paragraphs":["phonetically [~aribahu], \"he drank it,\" receives the tokenizer types ARABIC, PERFECT, and SUFFIX.

A token cannot be both simultaneously. Others, however, such as NOUN and DEF_ART, can both be applied to a token. 2.1.2 Implementation We initially developed the morphological analysis module as a sequence of 31 patterns in Perl's regular expression language. This allowed us to efficiently 9"]},{"title":"I ISO 8859-6 Text I\"~.. f I Tokens with features","paragraphs":["]"]},{"title":"I SGML-annotated text Stem Usts Morphological Tokenizer ~ Feature-extraction Rules Word Usts Name Finder ~rNetOwl _ J Pattern-Action TurboTagTM ~.t I Rules ( Pattem Engine J","paragraphs":["Figure 1: TAGARAB Architecture develop and refine the patterns needed to recognize the various morphological word-shapes. When we plugged this version of the morphological analyzer into the original tokenizer, however, processing was quite slow due to the sequential nature of our morphological patterns and the backtracking nature of Perl's regular expression matcher. To compensate, we incorporated the morphological functionality directly into the Flex specification of the tokenizer. Whenever the Flex-generated scanner identifies an Arabic word, it dispatches the appropriate regular-expression to extract the separate morphemes from that word -- a task that is beyond the capability of Flex.","The result is the fastest Arabic morphological analyzer we are aware of: The overall processing rate for TAGARAB is approximately 46 megabytes/hour on a Sun Ultra 1. Morphological processing by itself runs at about 190 megabytes/hour. 2.1.3 Linguistic Design We had originally planned to develop a morphological capability that would be helpful in improving name recognition, as discussed in Section 1.2. In the following, we discuss the linguistic design of the morphological analysis.","Arabic is a highly inflected language. We be-lieved that there are frequently enough surface cues in the shape of an Arabic word ~ to allow the as-signment of the kind of morphological information described in Section 2.1.1. For example, inflected forms of derived verb stems such as [yaftatiHu], \"he inaugurates,\" would seem to have an orthographic \"shape\" that is fairly unique in an Arabic text. We felt that this information could be exploited to suecessfully identify tokens as nouns, verbs (perfects or imperfects), etc., to a sufficiently reliable extent that the later name-recognition patterns could effectively make use of it.","The morphological analysis process consists of a series of regular expressions partially supported by lists of noun, verb, and adjective stems, as well as closed-class items. The regular expressions cover all allowable prefixes and suffixes for each stem type. Infixation phenomena, however, such as the infixed","of the Eighth Verbal Form, s are handled as variant forms in the verb stem list e.g.,"]},{"title":"'gtbr,","paragraphs":["\"he considered\" and"]},{"title":"9br,","paragraphs":["\"he crossed.\" No attempt is made to handle co-occurrence constraints among prefixes and suffixes, nor to assign voice. Likewise, no attempt is made to include contextual information, as is done with standard part-of-speech taggers. There is no attempt to handle ambiguity: The regular expression patterns are ordered, and the search for an analysis of a word stops at the first match. The token types are then assigned, and the form is not submitted to any other regular expressions.","Not all Arabic tokens are hit by one of these regular-expression patterns that provide morphological features. Although there is a mix of patterns supported by lexical information and patterns that operate entirely by rule (no supporting lexical data), the vast majority of matches appear to occur with the former set of patterns. In other words, the coverage of the morphological analysis is crucially dependent on the lexical data. There are 1051 noun forms, 813 verb forms, and 241 adjective forms. There is also a comprehensive list of closed-class items. The notion of \"lexical item\" in TAGARAB's lists is somewhat similar to the listing principle found in Landau : broken plural forms for nouns and ad-","rTAGAFtAB deals exclusively with the written forth, i.e., without indication of short vowels.","SWe use the usual terms for these forms found in Western grammars. 10 jectives receive an independent entry, much like different stems of verbs as mentioned previously. We make no effort to distinguish I and II forms of verbs, as these are not usually distinguished orthographically in AI-Hayat. In general, if there is no visible orthographic distinction in normal Arabic prose, we do not make a distinction in the lexical data.","We also entered forms both with and without hamza, as in AbHayat any form that may receive a hamza may also appear without it (even in the same text!).","Another important feature is that we entered only what seemed to us to be frequent lexical items in the lexical lists, and tried to do it in such a manner that what seemed intuitively the most likely reading of a form would be the one selected. This makes sense in the case of such a highly deterministic morphology and also given our time and resource constraints. We wanted to ensure that we got the right readings for a large number of highly frequent items, as this would be the most useful way to constrain the name-recognition patterns. Many high-frequency common nouns, verbs, adjectives, and other parts of speech in Arabic do not usually form part of names. As it turned out (See Section 4 below), this strategy worked quite well with person names but was less significant for organization names.","We also decided not to enter items that are used directly by the later name-recognition patterns, such as locations and given names, as these are accessed by the patterns through that module's own word lists and therefore having a morphological reading for them is not important (see Section 2.2).","In addition to the supporting lexical data, the or-dering of the regular expressions also aided in determining the analysis selected. The regular expressions are grouped functionally, and in general the ones pertaining to closed class items apply first, then nouns, adjectives, perfects, and imperfects in that order. This had the effect that items which are highly \"marked\" as belonging to one category (e.g., verbs with a double pronominal object) would be captured appropriately by a verb-recognizing regular expression that looks for such suffixes, but that items that are not so highly marked (e.g., a simple third-person masculine perfect form) would be biased towards a reading according to the order of the regular expressions.","We were pleasantly surprised to learn that this kind of approach -- although obviously simplistic in some ways -- produces a very high level of precision in analysis (i.e., the parts of speech assigned tend strongly to be correct) and surprisingly good recall (i.e., there is good coverage of the corpus). We discuss our empirical results in Section 3.","In addition, the morphological information thus produced contributed substantially to the effective-ness of the name-recognition patterns. We discuss this in Section 4. 2.2 Name Finder The Name Finder module of TAGARAB (see Figure 1) uses as input the tokens found by the Morphological Tokenizer with the basic and morphological features attached. The pattern-matching engine is SRA's NetOwl TurboTag TM. It uses data consisting of a set of Pattern-Action rules supported by Word Lists. The latter consists of items such as personal titles that are used by the patterns to recognize names. The Pattern-Action rules use contextual and structural information about names to recognize them dynamically. They also make extensive use of the feature information coming from the Morphological Tokenizer. There is minimal permanent storage of names.","The Pattern-Action rules are written in a convenient specification language. They are not compiled, but are read at run time as part of engine initializa-tion. 3 Evaluation 3.1 Morphology 3.1.1 Preparation To evaluate the quality of the morphological analysis, we used SRA's tagging tool, TagTool TM, to manually tag a set of documents for morphological analysis and part of speech. 9","For this test document set, we randomly selected fourteen texts from the AI-Hayat CD-ROM not belonging to the name recognition training or testing sets. In addition to manually tagging them, we also ran TAGARAB over these fourteen texts and used a standard MUC-style scoring program to compare the morphological output of TAGARAB with the \"answers\" in the hand-tagged version. 3.1.2 Tagging Rules We hand-tagged every token in the text, except for: s Punctuation, Digits s Tokens within person names • Person titles * Locations • Location adjectives (e.g., [kuwayd], ~ubn~n;])","• Adverbs or accusative forms of nouns or adjectives marked by"]},{"title":"fatHafayn.","paragraphs":["°Because of staiTmg constraints and need for knowledge of Arabic, the same person worked on both the development of the morphology component, the name patterns, and also hand-tagged the test set. To remove as far as possible any taint, we did not change the system or any supporting data once the manual tagging began. 11","These exceptions exist because the morphology component did not attach features to these items for the reasons given in Section 2.1.3. As a result of not hand-tagging them, the scoring program judged as spurious any morphological features found by the system for such items.","We tagged the test set contextually, again in accordance with the design of the morphological component. The most important effect was on the feature PART. We found participles which act usually as a noun, (e.g., [al-ma~rfig], \"the plan\", [almuwaz.z.af], \"the employee\"), usually as an adjective (e.g., [al-bayt al-majhfil], \"the unknown house\") or seem to be freely used in either reading (e.g., [muslim], \"Muslim,\"). We tagged these participles contextually as nouns or adjectives. One effect of this was that the number of items tagged as participles was quite low (in effect, only when they are used predicatively).","In all, the evaluation corpus contains 3214 tokens, of which 2324 are Arabic words. 1879 of the latter received morphological features when hand-tagged. 3.1.3 Morphology Evaluation The scores for the morphology component are given in Table 2. l°","Since we did not have access to a morphological analyzer that produces all possible readings for forms based on a large lexicon, we do not have a picture of the total morpho-lexical ambiguities in our evaluation texts. However, despite the small lexicon we manually built, the overall recall is reasonable (73.0%), and it also holds up well for most of the major open class items: perfects (72.7%), imperfects (60.2%), and nouns (66.8%). The low recall in adjectives (28.8%) is due to the fact that we did not make many lexical entries for adjectives. Since adjectives do not come first in the Arabic noun phrase, and since we use the morphological information to constrain the name patterns, tagging the head noun in a noun phrase is what is generally necessary, not tagging the adjective.","What is striking in the above table is the high precision across all the categories, with the exception of adjectives and participles, the latter a very small set for the reasons set out in Section 3.1.2. Precision is consistently above 90%. We interpret this to mean that a manually built system with a moderate lexicon, having the capacity to only select one reading for a given form and not paying any attention","l°The colunm headings are the standard ones from MUC: POS: possible number of points (one point for identifying a constituent boundary, another for identifying its category), ACT: actual responses given, COP,: correct answers, PAR: boundary errors, INC: category labelling errors, SPU: responses given that are not in answer key, MIS: items in key missing from response, REC: recall (COR/POS), PRE: precision (COR/ACT), F-M: f-measure ((2.

Clearly, context or a higher level of syntactic/semantic understanding is required to differentiate the two readings.","On the other hand, the other major confusion revealed by this table, Noun/Adjective and Adjective/Noun, is one that seems easily remedied by building in some knowledge of short context into the morphology component. For example, the following three examples (and the rest resemble these) are cases where the system selects a noun reading for the adjective within the scope of a noun phrase: [lgji'fina muslimfin], \"Muslim refugees,\" [bi.sfiratin xa~a], \"in a special form,\" [mu'tamaruhu al-s.iHgfi], \"his news conference.\" In these cases, the adjectives also have noun readings, but the local context shows clearly which reading is correct.","These results identify specific areas of morpho-lexical ambiguity bringing into focus where additional contextual cues are needed for better ambiguity resolution. 3.2 Evaluation of Name Patterns The scores for the name recognition in TAGARAB over the training set of texts are given in Table 4.

This had the effect that name-finding patterns which had previously accessed the morphological features provided by the tokenizer could no longer do so. The patterns themselves were not changed in any way. The results are contained in Table 6. It should be compared with Table 5.","NUMBER and TIME do not show much change with morphological token information removed. This is not surprising, since the patterns identifying these elements rely on word lists of month names, written-out numerals, etc. We handled the different inflected forms of such items as words for time units ([9~m], \"year,\" etc.) by simply listing all possibilites (singular, dual, plural, masculine, feminine) as separate entries. This is a reasonable strategy given the relatively small number of inflected forms for these items. In addition, relying on \"static\" word lists rather than \"dynamically\" generated morphological information coming from the tokenizer reduces the risk of error.","PERSON names are affected the most by not having the morphological features available: Recall drops 12.2 points and Precision 24.1. By contrast, ENTITY names are less affected: Recall loses 7.4, and Precision 7.2.

Without this information, there was, for example, a huge increase in the number of spurious names (names tagged by TAGARAB but with no equivalent in the human-tagged keys; under the SPU column in the score reports): One typical example is the vocalized string [mudir al-9amaliygt alsiy~s~ya], \"Director of Political Operations,\" which the system took as a name, but which is actually an appositive to a preceding actual person name. The word [mud~r] is on the title list signalling the onset of a name and there is nothing to constrain the next two tokens from being consumed. If morphological type information were available signalling that [al-9amaliy~t] is not a likely name constituent, then the pattern would not have succeeded.","There was also increase in boundary errors (un-","lZWe do not have direct statistics on different name types in the source (e.g., Islamic, Russian). However, we do have statistics on the relative yields of the patterns, which are or-ganized themselves in terms of name types. Scores for Arabic: Blind Set der the PAR column in the score reports). These were those cases where the name pattern \"didn't know where to stop,\" as in [al-sayyid muHammad albaGd~d~ ka'annahu], where the last element would have received the feature CLOSED from the Morphological Tokenizer since it is a subordinating conjunction with a person suffix. A further side-effect of such a boundary error, as well as the spurious names, is that an element such as [ka'annahu], once it is considered part of a name by the system, will be used to recognize variant short forms of that name. This has the result that any [ka'annahu] in the article is subject to being classified as a person name.","By contrast with person names, the patterns generating entity names were less affected by the lack of morphological information since they were able to exploit more specific name structure. For example, a pattern for a specific class of entity names might include both the initial word [majlis], \"council,\" and have as final boundary marker an element such as a location adjective. The latter is a separate word list independent of the morphological component of the system. In effect, there are more specific structural indicators of entity names than there are of person names, so the patterns are written differently, with less reliance on morphological information.","The final category of names, LOCATION, shows a large increase in missing names (under the column MIS in the score reports). The reason for this might not be obvious, since location names do not receive any morphological features (see 2.1.3). However, the morphological capability within TAGARAB identifies clitic items such as the conjunctions [wa] and [fa], as well as the prepositions [ba], [la], and [ka], as described above in Section 2.1.1.

Although highly deterministic and not taking account of context, the morphological analysis component removes a great deal of morpho-lexical ambiguity and has the side-effect of demonstrating that the true difficulties in Arabic morphological ambiguity might be limited to specific contexts.","In addition, we have shown that named entity recognition in Arabic can be performed at levels consistent with other non-case languages despite great differences in structure between them. Finally, we have shown that morphological information is crucially important to effective Arabic name recognition.
