They have decided on an interlingua, a common communication language, and each has adopted an ontology, or domain conceptualization. This means that they have an established vocabulary from which neither may stray.","But how crucial is it that both agents have exactly the same vocabulary? People don't have exactly the same vocabulary, yet we communicate very well most of the time. When misunderstandings occur, they are often easily cleared up. Legacy systems and most current knowledge resources are incapable of clearing up miscommunications because they lack the intelligence to do so. Work toward giving information agents this capability is progressing, but in the interim, machines can't communicate. 1.2 Mediation One promising approach to this problem is to build specialized agents which facilitate communication between communicants who have adopted different ontologies, or even no formal ontology at all. Indeed, given that agents have adopted an interlingua and communication protocol, they can try to communicate. The mediator then tries to repair miscommunications as they occur.","We are concerned not with the process of detecting misunderstandings, but rather with ways to resolve communication problems. We focus on the problem of agents having different vocabularies.

Work is being done in this area (see, for example (McRoy, 1996)) but this is not the focus of our current research. We are more concerned with using mediation techniques to find correspondences between concepts in ontologies.

Without making a strong or precise statement as to what ontologies should be necessarily, we present some issues with respect to ontologies that our research addresses. 3.2.1 Words vs. Concepts Contrary to many ontology designers, who do not seem to distinguish between word (or symbol) and concept, we take an ontology to be an organization of an agent's concepts by some set of ontological relations. A concept is a particular agent's conceptualization of an element of the domain of discourse, and each concept can be denoted by one or more words. This way, words can be shared between agents, but concepts cannot. Naturally, we require a mapping between words and concepts to support reasoning about agents\" concepts. For a given agent, we currently assume a 1-1, onto mapping between concepts and words. Presently. we do not have algorithms that give a proper treatment of polysemy or synonomy of words for ontological mediation. 3.2.2 Concepts If an ontological mediator is to find words in one ontology that have the same meaning as words in another ontology, the mediator must be thinking about the concepts in those ontologies. The notion of a \"concept\" is very slippery, and frequently means different things to different people. Therefore, for the purpose of describing these algorithms and their underlying theory, we make the following definitions.","!. For any agent A and domain element O, ifA knows about or can think about O, then there exists a mental representation C in A's mind, which represents O. We write [[C]] A = O,","2. Concept: The mental entity C which exists in the mind of an agent and serves to represent some domain element for that agent.","3.

Whether a relation is truly ontological is a matter of opinion, but for example, some kind ofsubclass/superclass relation pair is almost always used to form a taxonomic hierarchy. 3.3.1 Hierarchical generalizer,s, and specializers A hierarchical ontological relation is any ontological relation that organizes concepts into a hierarchy, taxonomy, or similar structure. Hierarchical relations are related to but distinct from transitive relations. For example, the transitive relation ancestor is related to the hierarchical relation parent.","The hierarchical ontological relations are important for ontological mediation because they form the hierarchies organizing the concepts in the ontology.

Another reason for seemingly low success rates even","with both Synonyms and AllowAllSenses on is due to","a sort of polysemy inherent in dealing with WordNet.","While WordNet isn't really polysemous in its underly-","ing data structure since synsets provide a crisp distinc-","tion internally, any agent--human or machine--that uses","the ordinary external interface to WordNet makes queries","using single words that may have multiple senses (mean-","ings) in WordNet, and thereby may uncover data on more","than just one concept. [t stands to reason that an agent would perform on-","tological mediation more correctly if that agent were","sophisticated enough to understand that WordNet's re-","sposes (or the responses of any source that recognizes","terms as synonymous) may include multiple distinct","synsets, that each synset contains multiple synonymous","terms, and that these should be organized as one concept,","not many.

We expect that since many of the misses and errors are due to WordNet's polysemous nature, performance will improve when dealing with non-polysemous ontoiogies.","Long response times are due mainly to the size and density of the WordNet ontology. The ontological mediator running t, ledCount: must explore a sizable por-tion of each agent's ontology to arrive at its conclusion. Even though much of this exploration involves common words, OM still must establish many equivalences between ore-concepts that are expressed by the same word. Because WordNet is inherently a polysemous ontology, OM must explore several dead ends. For example, in discovering (successfully) that \"pushcart\" is synonymous with \"stroller,\" OM must look at senses of the word \"cartinge\" which then brings in all the parts of a typewriter. Work on pruning this sort of search is being considered.","Meanwhile we plan to apply ontological mediation algorithms to other ontoiogies including the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) (Humphreys and Lindberg, 1993). Mediating between two different ontologies, UMLS and WordNet will lead to new ideas for ontological mediation algorithms. Another experiment could involve human subjects, for example, those searching a database and are looking for just the fight keyword to find some target. We expect these experiments to lead to more robust ontological mediation algorithms."]},{"title":"8 Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This research was supported in part by Rome Laboratory and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under USAF contract F30602-93-C-0177."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["I.
