One of the disadvantages of developing a knowledge-based system, however, is that it is a very labour-intensive and timehconsuming task.

Introduction: robust, knowledge poor anaphora resolution and multilingual NLP For the most part, anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods (Carbonell & Brown 1988; Carter 1987; Hobbs 1978; Ingria & Stallard 1989; Lappin & McCord 1990; Lappin & Leass 1994; Mitkov 1994; Rich & LuperFoy 1988; Sidner 1979; Webber 1979).

Furthermore, in addition to the monolingual orientation of all approaches so far developed, most of the work has concentrated on pronoun resolution in one language alone (English). While anaphora resolution projects have been re ported for French (Popescu-Belis & Robba 1997, Rolbert 1989), German (Dunker & Umbach 1993; Fischer eta!. 1996; Leass & Schwa!l1991; Stuckardt 1996; Stuckardt 1997), Japanese (Mori eta!. 1997; Nakaiwa & Ikehara 1992; Nakaiwa & Ikehara 1995; Nakaiwa et a!. 1995; Nakaiwa et a!. 1996; Wakao 1994 ), Portuguese (Abra9os & Lopes 1994 ), Swedish (Fraurud, 1988) and Turkish (Tin & Akman, 1994), the research on languages other than English consti tutes only a small part of all the work in this field.","In contrast to previous work in the field, our proj ect has a tmly multilingual character. We have de veloped a knowledge-poor, robust approach which we propose as a platform for multilingual pronoun resolution in technical manuals. The approach was initially developed and tested for English, but we have also adapted and tested it for Polish and Arabic. We found that the approach could be adapted with minimum modifications for both languages and fur ther, even if used without any modification, it deliv ers acceptable success rates. Evaluation shows a success rate of 89.7% for English, 93.3% for Polish and 95.2% for Arabic.1 2. The approach: general overview With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, semantic and discourse analysis, we developed a robust, knowledge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not make use of parsing, syntactic and semantic constraints or any other form of linguistic or non-linguistic knowledge. Instead, we rely on the efficiency of sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase identification and the high per formance of the antecedent indicators (knowledge is limited to a small noun phrase grammar, a list of terms, a list of (indicating) verbs, a list of genre specific synonyms, and a set of antecedent indica~ tors).","The core of the approach lies in activating a list of multilingual' \"antecedent indicators\" after filtering candidates (from the current and two preceding sen tences) on the basis of gender and number agreement. Before that, the text is pre-processed by a sentence splitter which determines the sentence boundaries, a part-of-speech tagger which identifies the parts of the speech and a simple phrasal grammar which detects the noun phrases (In addition, in the case of complex 1 Given that the evaluation of the English version was more extensive, the figures for English are expected to be statis tically more representative. 2 We term the antecedent indicators \"multilingual\" because they work well not only for English, but also for other languages (in this case Arabic and Polish)."]},{"title":"8","paragraphs":["sentences, heuristic \"clause identification\" rules track the clause boundaries). Non~anaphoric occurrences of \"it\" in constructions such as \"It is important\", \"It is necessary\" etc., are eliminated by a \"referential fil ter11.","After passing the \"agreement filter\", the genre specific antecedent indicators are applied to the re maining candidates (see section 2.2). The noun phrase with the highest aggregate score is proposed as antecedent; in the rare event of a tie, priority is given to the candidate with the higher score for im mediate reference. If immediate reference has not been identified, then priority is given to the candidate with the best collocation pattern score. If this does not help, the candidate with the higher score for indi cating verbs is preferred. If still no choice is possible, the most recent from the remaining candidates is selected as the antecedent. 2.1 Agreement filter The detected noun phrases (from the sentence where the anaphor is situated and the two preceding sen tences, if available) are passed on to a gender and number agreement test. In English, however, there are certain collective nouns which do not agree in number with their antecedents (e.g. ''government\", \"team\", \"parliament\" etc. can be referred to by \"they\"; equally some plural nouns such as \"data\" can be referred to by \"it\") and are exempted from the agreement test. For this purpose we have drawn up a comprehensive list of all such cases; to our knowl edge, no other computational treatment of pronomi nal anaphora resolution has addressed the problem of \"agreement exceptions\".","The gender and number agreement of an anaphor and its antecedent in Polish is compulsory. Polish gender distinctions are much more diverse than in English (e.g. feminine and masculine do not apply to a restricted number of nouns). Moreover, one pro nominal form can potentially refer to nouns of differ ent gender. For instance, the singular genitive form \"jego\" can equally well refer to either masculine or neuter nouns. In addition, certain pronouns such as the accusative form 'je\" can refer to either singular neuter or plural feminine nouns. Finally, unlike Eng lish, zero anaphors (in subject position) are typical in Polish in declarative sentences.","Agreement rules in Arabic are different. For in stance, a set of non~human items (animals, plants, objects) is referred to by a singular feminine pro noun. Since Arabic is an agglutinative language, the pronouns may appear as suffixes of verbs, nouns (e.g. in the case of possessive pronouns) and prepositions. In particular, in the genre of technical manuals there are five \"agglutinative\" pronouns. The pronoun \"ho\" is used to refer to singular masculine persons and objects, while \"ha\" refers to singular feminine ones.

Candidates could be given pref erential treatment, or not, from the point of view of each indicator and assigned a score (-1, 0, I or 2) accordingly; the candidate with the highest aggregate score is proposed as the antecedent. The antecedent indicators have been identified on the basis of em~ pirical studies of numerous hand~annotated technical manuals (referential links had been marked by human experts). These indicators can be related to salience (definiteness, givenness, indicating verbs, indicating noun phrases, lexical reiteration, section heading preference, \"non-prepositional\" noun phrases, rela~ tive pronoun), to structural matches (collocation, immediate reference, sequential instructions), to referential distance or to preference of terms. Whilst some of the indicators are more genre-specific (term preference) and others are less genre-specific (\"im mediate reference\", \"sequential instructions\" and to a much lesser extent \"indicating noun phrases\"), the majority of them appear to be genre-independent. In the following we shall outline the indicatop used and shall illustrate some of them by examples (the indi cators are used in the same way for English, Polish and Arabic unless otherwise specified).

Lexical reiteration Lexically reiterated items are likely candidates for antecedent (a NP scores 2 if is repeated within the same paragraph twice or more, 1 if repeated once and 0 if not). Lexically reiterated items include repeated synonymous noun phrases which may often be pre ceded by definite articles or demonstratives.

There might be cases where one or more of the antecedent indicators do not \"point\" to the correct antecedent.

The approach described is not dependent on any theories or assumptions; in particular, it docs not operate on the assumption that the subject of the previous utterance is the highest-ranking candidate for the backward-looking center - an approach which can sometimes lead to incorrect results. For instance, most centering-orientated methods would propose \"the utility\" incorrectly as the antecedent of \"it\" in the . sentence \"The utility (CDVU) shows you a LIST4250, LIST38PP, or LIST3820 file on your terminal for a format similar to that in which it will be printed\" because of the preferential treatment of the subject as the most salient candidate (e.g. RAP, see Dagan et al. 1995).

The candidates for antecedent in this example are the noun phrases \"safety tab slot'', \"plastic tape\" and \"another cassette\". If we use the robust approach without any modification, each candidate gets 2 for referential distance; the aggregate score for \"safety tab slot\" is 3, for \"plastic tape\" it is 2 and for \"another cassette\" is 2 as well (they all get an additional 1 score for \"term preference\"). Using the new referen tial distance scores, however, the correct candidate \"another cassette\" scores an aggregate of 2 as op-posed to the other two candidates which are assigned an aggregate score of 1.","The second evaluation mode (evaluating the ver sion adapted and improved for Arabic which is re ferred to as \"Arabic improved\" in the table below) reported a success rate of 95.2% (60 out of 63 ana phors were correctly resolved).","The evaluation for Arabic also showed a very high \"critical success rate\" as well.

The robust approach adapted for Polish demonstrated a high success rate of 93.3% in resolving anaphors.","Similarly to the evaluation for English, we com pared the approach for Polish with (i) a Baseline Model which discounts candidates on the basis of agreement in number and gender and, if there were still competing candidates, selects as the antecedent the most recent subject matching the anaphor in gen der and number (ii) a Baseline Model which checks agreement in number and gender and, if there were still more than one candidate left, picks up as the antecedent the most recent noun phrase that agrees with the anaphor.","The Polish version of our robust approach showed clear superiority over both Polish baseline models. The first Baseline Model (Baseline Subject) was successful in only 23.7% of the cases, whereas the second (Baseline Most Recent) had a success rate of 68.4%. These results demonstrate the dramatic in crease in precision, which is due to the use of antece dent tracking indicators.","The Polish version also showed a very high \"criti cal success rate\" of 86.2%. Used without any modifi cation (\"Polish direct\"), the approach scored a 90% success rate.","The most discriminative antecedent indicators for Polish appear to be the sequential instructions, im mediate reference and indicating verbs (100%), fol lowed by referential distance (84.1 %) and givenness (80 %).","The most frequently used indicators for Polish were definiteness (97.2% of the cases), referential distance (94.4%), givenness (61.1 %) and non prepositional noun phrase (52.8%). The least fre quently used indicators proved to be indicating verbs (16.7%), lexical reiteration (13.9%) and immediate reference (2.8%). The success rates obtained can be summarised as follows: Success rate Robust English 89.7% Polish direct 90% Polish improved 93.3% Arabic direct 90.5% Arabic improved 95.2% Table 1: Success rates of the robust approach Success rate Baseline subject English 31.6% I 48.6% Baseline most recent English 65.9% Baseline subject Polish 23.7% Baseline most recent Polish 68.4% Table 2: Success rates of the baseline models Since the approach is robust, the success rates equal both recall and precision except for \"Baseline subject English\": since there are cases in which \"Baseline subject\" may not be able to pick up an antecedent (e.g. paragraphs with zero subjects), this version can be measured in terms of both precision (the higher figure in table 2) and recall (the lower figure). 4. Future work Future work includes adapting the approach for French, Spanish and Bulgarian as well as testing it on (and if necessary, modifying it to cover) a wider variety of genres. In addition, we plan to use the statistically-based multicriteria approach (Pomerol & Barbara-Romero, 1992) to fine-tune scoring. 5. Conclusion We have described a genre-specific modification of the practical approach to pronoun resolution (Mitkov 1998a) and have shown its multilingual nature: we have adapted and tested the approach for Polish and Arabic. The evaluation reports success rates which are comparable to (and even better than) syntax~ based methods and show superiority over other methods with limited knowledge."]},{"title":"14","paragraphs":["References","Abra,os, Jose & Jose G.
