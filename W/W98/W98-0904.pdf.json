Candidate sets are formalized by inviolable lexical constraints which map abstract morpheme signatures to allomorphs. Phonology is implemented as violable rankable constraints selecting optimal candidates from these. Both types of constraints are realized by finite state transducers. Using phonological data from Albanian it is shown that given a finite state lexicalization of candidate outputs for word forms OM allows more natural analyses than unviolable finite state constraints do. Two possible evaluation strategies for OM grammars are considered: the global evaluation procedure from E1lisou (1994) and a simple strategy of local constraint evaluation. While the OM-specific lexicalization of candidate sets allows straightforward generation and a simple method of morphological parsing even under global evaluation, local constraint evaluation is shown to be preferable empirically and to be formally more restrictive. The first point is illustrated by an account of directionality effects in some classi-cal Mende data. A procedure is given that generates a finite state transducer simulating the effects of local constraint evaluation. Thus local as opposed to global evaluation (Frank & Satta, 1998) seems to guarantee the finite-stateness of the input-output-mapping."]},{"title":"1 C/O-Alternations in Albanian Verbs","paragraphs":["In many cases C/O-alternations in the Albanian verb paradigm are triggered by the tendency to avoid sequences of vowels (VV, hiatus) or consonants (CC), e.g."]},{"title":"(1)","paragraphs":["(a) (b) (c) (d)"]},{"title":"p~,je *pie hape *hapje","paragraphs":["CVCV CVV CVCV CVCCV 'drink it!'

It is not a priori clear that this is favorable to eliminating arbitrary rule (constraint) ordering or underlying representations, and indeed this last choice is what happens in OM, while DP has eliminated two of SPEs theoretical instruments. In this respect it is the most restrictive framework, but we have seen empirical and conceptual problems with its assumptions in the preceeding section. Consider the following: Lexicalized candidate sets in both DP and OM are given by language-specific constraints, thus this point makes no difference. Now, when the toy example above proves to be representative, OM (like OT) allows to maintain universal constraints where DP cannot.","7See section 6 for an example of ranking.","SNote that the OT-claim to use only language-specific constraints is crucially weakened by the family of alignment-constraints that can be instantiated in a language-specific way. It might seem that OM can handle regular phonological processes only by stipulation of allomorphs with a high degree of redundancy. Thus for the case of German final devoicing we would have to assume two allomorphs for each morpheme showing the alternation, e.g. {Tod, Tot} 9 as in Tot, 'death(sig)' and Tode,'death-plu'. The choice between these allomorphs could be accomplished by the two constraints !DEVOICE that marks voiced obstruents in coda position and !VOICE that marks unvoiced obstruents generally. The ranking 1Â° !DEVOICE ~> !VOICE will make 'Tot'- the optimal candidate in Tot and 'Tod-' in Tode. Tot, 'dead' with an \"underlying\" t will remain the same in every context, assuming that this is the only allomorph. Though this works technically it seems highly undesirable to have two allomorphs for Tod one of which can be predicted.But the regular expression (Tod [ Tot) can equally well be written as To(d[t) or even as To[-continuant -sonorant +coronal] since regular languages can be enriched straightforwardly by bundles of finite-valued features (Kaplan Kayi 1994:349-351).

Parsing phonological output forms onto morphological signatures in OM is relatively straightforward while the question is not even adressed seriously in finite state formalizations of OT. (Ellison, 1994; Eisner, 1997). Both parsing and generation are even simpler if OM is interpreted as a finite state transducer under local constraint evaluation.
