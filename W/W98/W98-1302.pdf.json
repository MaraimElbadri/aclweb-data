We show that context-free parsing can be realised by a 2-phase process, relying on an approximated context-free gr~mm~r. In the first phase {t finite transducer performs parsing according to the approximation. In the second phase, the approximated parses are refined according to the original grammar. 1 Introduction A recent publication [15] presented a novel way of transforming a context-free grammar into a new grammar that generates a regular language. This new language is a superset of the orighal language. It was argued that this approach has advantages over other methods of regular approximation [16, 7].","Our method of approximation is the following. We define a condition on context-free grammars that is a suiBcient condition for a grammar to generate a regular language. We then give a transformation that turns an arbitrary grammar into another grammar that satisfies this condition. This transformation is obviously not language-preserving; it adds strings to the language generated by the original grammar, in such a way that the language becomes regular.","In the present communication we show how this procedure needs to be extended so that context-free parsing can be realised by a 2-phase process. For the first phase, the approximated grammar is turned into a finite transducer. This transducer processes the input in linear time and produces a table. In the second phase, this table is processed to obtain the set of all parses according to the original grammar.","The order of the time complexity of the second phase is cubic, which corresponds to the time complexity of most context-free parsing algorithms that are used in practice. However, the first phase filters out many parses that are inconsistent with respect to the regular approximation. This may reduce the effort needed by the second phase.","It is interesting to note that the work presented here is conceptually related to use of regular lookahead in context-free parsing [5]. '","The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we recall some standard definitions from language theory. Section 3 investigates a sut~cient condition for a context-free grammar to generate a regular language, We also present the construction of a finite transducer from such a grammar.","How this transducer reads input and how the output of the transducer can be turned into a representation of all parse trees is discussed in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.","An algorithm to transform a grammar if the sufficient condition mentioned above is not satisfied is given in Section 6. Section 7 explains how this transformation can be incorporated into the construction of the transducer and how the output of such a transducer is then to be interpreted in order to obtain parse trees according to the original grammar.","Some preliminary conclusions drawn from empirical results are given in Section 8. 13"]},{"title":"I I I","paragraphs":["2 Preliminaries"]},{"title":"II II A context-free grammar G","paragraphs":["is a 4-tuple (27, N, P, S), where 27 and N are two finite disjoint sets of terminals and nonterminals, respectively, S E N is the start symbol, and P is a finite set of rules.

Therefore, we have to prove that if recursive(Ni) • {left, right, cyclic}, for all i, then the gra.rnmar generates a regular language. Our proof differs from an existing proof [3] in that it is fully constructive: Figure 2 presents an algorithm for creating a fiaite transducer that recognizes as input all strings from the language generated by the grammar, and produces output strings of a form to be discussed shortly.","The process is initiated at the start symbol, and from there the process descends the grammar in all ways until terminals are encountered. Descending the grammar is straightforward in the case of rules of which the left-hand side is not a recursive nonterminal: the subautomata found recursively for members in the right-hand side will be connected. In the case of recursive nonterminals, the process depends on whether the nonterminals in the corresponding set from A/\" are mutually left-recursive or right-recursive; ff they are both, which means they are cyclic, then either subprocess can be applied; in the code in Figure 2 cyclic and left-recursive subsets Ni are treated lmiformly.","We discuss the case that the nonterminals are left-recursive or cyclic.

Similarly, a nonterminal of the form CA belongs to a set, say M2, which satisfies recursive (M2) = left (or recursive(M2) = cyclic). Treatment of these nonterminals occurs in a deeper level of recursion of make_fst, and appears as separate cases in Figure 6.","It is important to remember that the sets Ni in Figure 6 always refer to the nature of recursion in the original grammar; the transformed grammar is merely implicit in the given construction of the transducer, and helps us to understand the construction in terms of Figure 2. In addition to hnit, filter items from the following set are used: I~d = {B ~ oe o C~ I (B --r aCfl) ~ P A 3i[recursive(Ni) = self A B, C ~ Ni]} The meaning of the dianaond is largely unchanged with regard to Section 3.

Y,n o E/~ is output, which indicates that an instance of ~ ...

Initial experiments allow some tentative conclusions, reported here.","We have compared the 2-phase algorithm to a traditional tabular context-free parsing algorithm. In order to allow a fair comparison, we have taken a mixed parsing strategy that applies a set of dotted items comparable to that of Section 7. Ass~ming the input is given by al ... an as before, the steps are given by: (a) We choose i,'such that 0 ~ i _< n, and (A -~ ~ o) E/~n~t and add [i, A ~ ~ o, i] to U. (b) We choose [i,B -4 • 7,J] E U and (A -* a o B) E I~,.t, and add [i,A ~ a * B,j] to U. (c) We choose [i + 1,A ~ aa~+l • E,j] E U and add [i,A --* a • a~+lE, j] to U. (d) We choose [i,B --* • 7,j], [j, A ~ ~B • E,k] E U and add [i,A ---> a • BE, k] to U.","For the experiments we have taken a grammar for German, generated automatically through EBL, of which a considerable part contaln.q self-embedding. The transducer was determinized and minimized as if it were a finite automaton, i.e. in a transition (q, vlw , q~) the pair vlw is treated as one symbol, and the pair ele is treated as the empty string. The test sentences were obtained using a random generator [14].","For a given input sentence, we define T1 and T2 to be the number of steps that are performed for the respective phases of the 2-phase algorithm: first, the creation of 3 r from the input al-..an, and second, the creation of U from ~'. We define Tcf: to be the number of steps that are performed for the direct construction of table U from al... an by the above tabular algorithm.","Concerning the two processes with context-free power, viz. To! and T2, we have observed that in the majority of cases there is a reduction in the number of steps from To! to T2. This can be a reduction from several hundreds of steps to less than 10. In individual cases however, especially for long sentences, T2 can be larger than To!. This can be explained by the fact that ~r may have many more states than that the input sentence has positions, which leads to less sharing of computation.","Adding T1 and T2 in many cases leads to higher numbers of steps than To!. At this stage we cannot say whether this implies that the 2-phase idea is not useful. Many refinements, especially concerning the reduction of the number of states of 3 r in order to enhance sharing of computation, have as yet not been explored.","In this context, we observe that the size of the repertoire of filter items has conflicting consequences for the overall complexity. If T outputs no filter items, then it reduces to a recognizer, which can be determinized. Consequently, T1 will be equal to the sentence length, but T2 will be no less than (and in fact identical to) To!. If on the other hand T outputs many types of filter item, then determinization and minimization is more difficult and consequently yr may be large and both T1 and T2 may be high. 23"]},{"title":"II II II Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["Parts of this research were carried out within the framework of the Priority Programme Language and Speech Technology (TST), while the author was employed at the University of Groningen.
