How to define a context-free backbone for DGs: Implementing a DG in the LFG formalism","paragraphs":["Norbert BrSker","Universitiit Stuttgart","Azenbergstr. 12 D-70174 Stuttgart","NOBI~IMS.UNI-STUTTGART.DE","Abstract This paper presents a multidimensional Dependency Grammar (DG), which decouples the dependency tree from word order, such that surface ordering is not determined by traversing the dependency tree. We develop the notion of a word order domain structure, which is linked but structurally dissimilar to the syntactic dependency tree. We then discuss the implementation of such a DG using constructs from a unification-based phrase-structure approach, namely Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG). Particular attention is given to the analysis of discontinuities in DG in terms of LFG's functional uncertainty. 1 Introduction Recently, the concept of valency has gained considerable attention. Not only do all linguistic theories refer to some reformulation of the traditional notion of valency (in the form of 0grid, subcategorization list, argument list, or extended domain of locality); there is a growing number of parsers based on binary relations between words (Eisner, 1997; Maruyama, 1990). Even theories based on phrase structure may have processing models based on relations between lexical items (Rambow & Joshi, 1994).","Against the background of this interest in the valency concept, and the fact that word order is one of the main difference between phrase-structure based approaches (henceforth PSG) and dependency grammar (DG), this paper will propose a word order description for DG and describe its implementation. First, we will motivate the separation of surface order and dependency relations within DG, and make a specific architectural proposal for their linking. Second, we will briefly sketch Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG), and then show in detail how one might use the formal constructs provided by LFG to encode the proposed DG architecture.","Our position will be that dependency relations are motivated semantically (Tesni~re, 1959), and need not be projective. We argue for so-called word order domains, consisting of partially ordered sets of words and associated with nodes in the dependency tree. These order domains constitute a tree defined by set inclusion, and surface word order is determined by traversing this tree. A syntactic analysis therefore consists of two linked, but dissimilar trees.","The paper thus sheds light on two questions. A very early result on the weak generative equivalence of context-free grammars and DGs suggested that DGs are incapable of describing surface word order (Gaifman, 1965). J This result has been criticised to apply only to impoverished DGs which do not properly represent formally the expressivity of contemporary DG variants (Neuhaus & BrSker, 1997), and our use of a context-free backbone with further constraints imposed by dependency relations further supports the view that DG is not a notational ~riant of context-free grammar. The second ques-tion addressed is that of efficient processing of discontinuous DGs. By converting a native DG grammar into LFG rules, we are able to profit from the state of the art in context-free parsing technology. A context-free base (or skeleton) has often been cited as a prerequisite for practical applicability of a natural language grammar (Erbach & Uszkoreit, 1990), and we here show that a DG can meet this criterion with ease.","Sec. 2 will briefly review approaches to word order in DG, and Sec. 3 introduces word order domains as our proposal. LFG is briefly introduced in Sec. 4, and the encoding of DG within the LFG framework is the topic of Sec. 5. 29"]},{"title":"I I I I I I I I I i I l I I i I ! i","paragraphs":["2 Word Order in DG A very brief characterization of DG is that it recognizes only lexical, not phrasal nodes, which are linked by directed, typed, binary relations to form a dependency tree (Tesni~re, 1959; Hudson, 1993). If these relations are motivated semantically, such dependency trees can be non-projective. Consider the extracted NP in \"Beans, I know John likes\". A projective tree would require \"Beans\" to be connected to either \"1\" or \"know\" - none of which is conceptually di-rectly related to \"Beans\". It is \"likes\" that determines syntactic features of \"Beans\" and which provides a semantic role for it. The only connection between \"know\" and \"Beans\" is that the finite verb allows the extraction of\"Beans\", thus defining order restrictions for the NP. The following overview of DG flavors shows that various mechanisms (global rules, general graphs, procedural means) are generally employed to lift the limitation of projectivity and discusses some shortcomings of these proposals. Functional Generative Description (Sgall et al., 1986) assumes a language-independent underlying order, which is represented as a projective dependency tree. This abstract representation of the sentence is mapped via ordering rules to the concrete surface realization. Recently, Kruijff (1997) has given a categorial-style formulation of these ordering rules. He assumes associative categorial operators, permut-ing the arguments to yield the surface ordering. One difference to our proposal is that we argue for a representational account of word order (based on valid structures representing word order), eschewing the non-determinism introduced by unary categorial operators; the second difference is the avoidance of an underlying structure, which stratifies the theory and makes incremental processing difficult. Meaning-Text Theory (Melc'flk, 1988) assumes seven strata of representation. The rules mapping from the unordered dependency trees of surface-syntactic representations onto the annotated lexeme sequences of deep-morphological representations include global ordering rules which allow discontinuities. These rules have not yet been formally specified (Melc'~k & Pertsov, 1987p.187f) (but see the proposal by Rambow & Joshi (in print)). 30 Word Grammar (WG, Hudson (1990)) is based on general graphs instead of trees. The ordering of two linked words is specified together with their dependency relation, as in the proposition \"object of verb follows it\". Extraction of, e.g., objects is analyzed by establishing an additional dependency called visitor between the verb and the extractee, which requires the reverse order, as in \"visitor of verb precedes it\". Resulting inconsistencies, e.g. in case of an extracted object, are not resolved. This approach compromises the semantic motivation of dependencies by adding purely order-induced dependencies. Dependency Unification Grammar (DUG, Hellwig (1986)) defines a tree-like data structure for the representation of syntactic analyses. Using morphosyntactic features with special interpretations, a word defines abstract positions into which modifiers are mapped. Partial orderings and even discontinuities can thus be described by allowing a modifier to occupy a position defined by some transitive head. The approach requires that the parser interprets several features in a special way, and it cannot restrict the scope of discontinuities. Slot Grammar (McCord, 1990) employs a number of rule types, some of which are exclusively concerned with precedence. So-called head/slot and slot/slot ordering rules describe the precedence in projective trees, referring to arbitrary predicates over head and modifiers. Extractions (i.e., discontinuities) are merely handled by a mechanism built into the parser. 3 Word Order Domains Extending the previous discussion, we require the following of a word order description for DG:","• not to compromise the semantic motivation of dependencies,","• to be able to restrict discontinuities to certain constructions and delimit their scope,","• to be lexicalized without requiring lexical ambiguities for the representation of ordering alternatives,","• to be declarative (i.e., independent of an analysis procedure), and"]},{"title":"Ii I, i,","paragraphs":["I,"]},{"title":",!","paragraphs":["' / , \". ,. der Junge; i gess.ehen.', , :",",,. :","• , \"den Mann;; \"-. .-\" , ,","• -. .... - -._.o. • Figure 1: Dependency Tree and Order Domains for (1) do",",.

The cardinality of an order domain may be restricted to at most one element, at least one element, or - by conjunction - to exactly one element. Each word is associated with a sequence of order domains, one of which must contain the word itself, and each of these domains may require that its elements have certain features. Order domains can be partially ordered based on set inclusion: If an order domain d contains word w (which is not associated with d), every word w' contained in a domain d t associated with w is also contained in d; therefore, d' C d for each d' associated with w. This partial ordering in-duces a tree on order domains, which we call the order domain structure. The order domain structure constitutes a projective tree over the input, where order domains loosely correspond to partial phrases.","(1) Den Mann hat der Junge gesehen. the manAcc has the bOyNOM seen 'The boy has seen the man.' Take the German example (1). Its dependency tree is shown in Fig. 1, with word order domains indicated by dashed circles. The finite verb, \"hat\", defines a sequence of domains, (dl, d2, d3), which roughly correspond to the topological fields in the German main clause. The nouns and the participle each define a single order domain. Set inclusion gives rise to the domain structure in Fig. 2, where the individual words are attached by dashed lines to their including domains. 3.2 Surface Ordering How is the surface order derived from an order domain structure? First of all, the ordering of domains is inherited by their respective elements, i.e., \"Mann\" precedes (any element of) d2, \"hat\" follows (any element of) dl, etc.","Ordering within a domain, e.g., of \"hat\" and d6, or ds and d6, is based on precedence predicates (adapting the precedence predicates of WG). There are two different types, one ordering a word with respect to any other element of the domain it is associated with (e.g., \"hat\" with respect to d6), and another ordering two moditiers, referring to the dependency relations they occupy (d5 and d6, referring to subj and vpart). A verb like \"hat\" introduces three precedence predicates, requiring other words (within the same domain) to follow itself and the participle to follow subject and object, resp.: 1","\"hat\" => <.

Further information can be found in Bresnan & Kaplan (1982) and Dalrymple et al. (1995).","LFG posits several different representation levels, called"]},{"title":"projections.","paragraphs":["Within a projection, a certain type of linguistic knowledge is represented, which explains differences in the formal setup (data types and operations) of the projections. The two standard projections, and those used here, are the constituent (c-) structure and the functional (f-) structure (Kaplan (1995) and Halvorsen & Kaplan (1995) discuss the projection idea in more detail). C-structure is defined in terms of context-free phrase structure rules, and thus forms a projective tree of categories over the input. It is assumed to encode language particularities with respect to the set of categories and the possible orderings. The f-structure is constructed fi'om additional annotations attached to the phrase structure rules, and has the form of an attribute-value matrix or feature structure. It is assumed to represent more or less langnage-independent information about grammatical functions and predicate-argument structure. In addition to the usual unification operation, LFG employs existential and negative constraints on features, which allow the for-nmlation of constraints about the existence of features without specifying the associated value.","Consider the following rules, which are used for illustration only and do not constitute a canonical LFG analysis.","S =~ NP VP","(TosJ)=~ 1\"=$ (,tcAsE)=acc","NP =~ Det N (I\"sPEC)~\"~J \" T--J,","VP =~ V NP","T=J.

Each c-structure node is associated with an f-structure node as shown by the arrows. The f-structure node associated with the left-hand side of a rule may be accessed with the $ metavariable, while the f-structure node of a right-hand side element may be accessed with the $ metavariable. The mapping from c-structure nodes to f-structure nodes is not one-to-one, however, since the feature structures of two distinct c-structure nodes may be identified (via the $=$ annotation), and additional embedded features may be introduced (such as CASE). Assuming that only finite verbs carry the TENSE feature, the existential constraint ($TENSE) requires a finite verb at the beginning of the VP, while the negative constraint .~($TENSE) forbids finite verbs at the end of the VP. Note that unspecified feature structures are displayed as [ ] in the figure, and that much more information (esp. predicate-argument information) will come from the lexical entries.","Another important construct of LFG is functional uncertainty (Kaplan & Zaenen, 1995; Kaplan & Maxwell, 1995). Very often (most notably, in extraction or control constructions) the path of f-structure attributes to write down is indeterminate. In this case, one may write down a description of this path (using a regular language over attribute names) and let the parser check every path described (possibly resulting in ambiguities warranted by f-structure differences only). Our little grammar may be extended to take advantage of functional uncertainty in two ways. First, if you want to permute subject and object (as is possible in German), you might change the S rule to the following:","S =~ NP VP (t{os~ I susJ})=~ t=~","The f-structure node of the initial NP may now be inserted in either the OBJ or the SUBJ attribute of the sentence's f-structure, which is expressed by the disjunction {OBJiSUBJ} in the annotation.

We have already presented the VALENCY template in (3) and will now explain it. {.-- I \"\"} represents a disjunction of possibilities, and the parameter _o (for optionality)controls their selection. In case we provide the opt value, there • is an option to forbid the existence of the dependency, expressed by the negative constraint --~($_d). Regardless of the value of _o, there is another option to introduce an attribute named _d (for dependency) which contains a CLASS attribute with a value specified by the third parameter, _c. The existential constraint for the LEXEME attribute requires that some other word (which specifies a LEXFA~IE) is unified into the feature _d, thereby filling this valency slot. The use of a defining constraint for the CLASS attribute constructs the feature, allowing nonconstructive functional uncertainty to fill in the modifier (as explained below).","A typical lexical entry is shown in (8), where the surface form is followed by the c-structure category and some template invocations. These expand to annotations defining the CLASS and LEXEME features, and use the VALENCY template to define the valency frame. (8)","hat Vfin ©(Vfin aux-perfect_) @(VALENCY req SUBJ N) @(VALENCY req VPART Vpp). 5.4 Continuous and Discontinuous","Attachment So far we get only a c-structure where words are associated with f-structures containing valency frames. To get the f-structure shown in Fig. 5~ (numbers refer to c-structure node numbers of Fig. 4) we need to establish dependency relations, i.e., need to put the f-structures associated with preterminal nodes together into one large f-structure. Establishing dependency relations between the words relies heavily on the mechanism of functional uncertainty. First, we must identify on f-structure the head of each order domain sequence. For this, we annotate in every c-structure rule the category of the head word with the template ~(HEAV), which identifies the head word's f-structure with the order domain's f-structure (cf. (9)). Second, all other c-structure categories (which represent modifiers) are annotated with the ~(MODIFIER) template defined in (10). This template states that the f-structure of the modifier (referenced by .~) may be placed under some dependency attribute path of the f-structure of the head (referenced by ~). These paths are of the form p d, where p is a (possibly empty) regular expression over dependency attributes, and d is a dependency attribute, d names the dependency relation the modifier finally fills, while p describes the path of dependencies which may separate the positional from the direct head of the modifier. The MODIFIER template thus completely describes the legal discontinuities: If p is empty for a dependency d, modifiers in dependency d are always continuously attached (i.e., in an order domain defined by their direct head). This is thecase for the subject (in dependency SUB J) and the determiner (in dependency SPEC), in this example. On the other hand, a non-empty path p allows the modifier to 'float up' the dependency tree to any transitive head reachable via p. In our example, objects depending on participles may thus float into domains of the finite verb (across VPART dependencies), and relative clauses (in dependency RELh) may float from the noun's domain into the finite verb's domains.

Can these analyses and insights be transferred? On the practical side, can the conversion we sketched be used to create efficient large-scale DGs?
