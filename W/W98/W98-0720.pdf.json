Two different classes of metonymies are inferred by using (1) lexico-semantic connections between concepts or (2) morphological cues and logical formulae defining lexical concepts. In both cases the derivation of metonymic paths is based on approximations of sortal constraints retrieved from WordNet.","This novel method of inferring coercions validates the related knowledge through coreference links. As a result, metonymic coercions are potentially useful for the recognition of coreferring entities in information extraction systems. 1"]},{"title":"Problem description","paragraphs":["The pervasive phenomenon of metonymy raises a problem for the interpretation of real-world texts. Metonymies are figures of speech in which, according to the literature definition from (Lakoff and Johnson, 1990), \"one entity is used to refer to another, that is related to it\". Characteristic of a metonymic reading of a textual expression is the fact that the satisfaction of sortal constraints guides the coercion to related knowledge.","The comprehensive account of the semantics of meaning transfers presented in (Nunberg, 1995) indicates that coercions need to be embedded in a conceptual and lexico-semantic space, ideally provided by a linguistic knowledge base. Nunberg also notes that coercions are licensed by pragmatic circumstances, specifically pertaining to the Gricean principles (Grice, 1975).","In this paper, we revisit the notion of metonymy and address the computational aspects of its resolution in the context of the relational semantics provided by the recently released WordNet 1.6 lexical database (www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn"]},{"title":").","paragraphs":["Following the lessons learned from the WordNet-based inference of Gricean implicatures, reported in (Harabagiu et al., 1996), a novel methodology of producing metonymic paths was devised.","The coercions combine WordNet relations with st'- 142 mantic information derived from conceptual definitions.

We propose here a metonymy resolution approach that accounts for an open class of coercions. Similarly to Nunberg (Nunberg, 1995) and more recently to Markert and Hahn (Markert and Hahn, 1997), we find metonymy and nominal reference resolution to be two interacting processes; therefore, the proposed computational model validates metonymies through coreference links. 2"]},{"title":"Classes of metonymic coercions","paragraphs":["Stallard proposed in (Stallard, 1993) a distinction between two kinds of metonymy: (1)"]},{"title":"referential raetonymy,","paragraphs":["in which the referent of a nominal predicate argument requires coercion and (2)"]},{"title":"predicative metonymy,","paragraphs":["featuring the coercion of the predicate usually corresponding to a verbal lexicaliza-tion. In his study, Stallard focuses on metonymic inferences required by a specific performative context, characterized by wh-questions and imperatives. His formalization of referential and predicative metonymies is based on the logical form readings of utterances from the DARPA ATIS (Air Travel Information Service) domain (MADCOW. 1992), a question-answering database about commercial air flights, comprising questions of the form:"]},{"title":"I I I I I I I I i I I I I I I I I I I","paragraphs":["(QI) Vhich wide-body jets serve dinner? (Q2) Which airlines fly from Boston to Denver? The ATIS domain is characterized by a pre-established formal system of categories and relations onto which the utterances must be mapped. In this domain it is known that only flights fly or serve meals; thus, both (Q1) and (Q2) can only be understood metonymically. The interpretation of the ATT$ utterances is performed in the logical language imposed by the implementation in the DELPHI system (Bobrow et al., 1991). In this framework, a question is translated into a LISP-expression: (wh x S (and (PI x) (P2 x)) interpreted as a query for all members of S (the semantic class of the wh-NP) that satisfy both PI (defined as the modifiers of the wh-NP) and P2 (the predicate of the clause). For exemplification, (qLFi) and (0LF2) represent the logical form translations of (QI) and (Q2)t:","(QLFI) (whx flights (and (exists y jets","(and (aircraft-of x y)"]},{"title":"(.ide-bodyy)) (serve","paragraphs":["flight-of","x meal-of dinner)))","(QLF2) (wh x airlines","(exists y flights","(and (airline-of y x)","(fly flight-of y","orig-o~ Boston","dest-of Denver))))","In the case of (QLFI), the coercion relation aircraft-of maps between flights and the aircrafts they are on, whereas in the case of (QLF2), the coercion relation airline-of translates the connec-tion between airlines and flights. Although both (QLFI) and (qLF2) have an interpolated quantifier for flights, which is not specified in the utterance, the difference comes from the position of the variable: in the case of (QLF1), the interpolated variable x is the wh-variahle, whereas in the case of (QLF2), the interpolated variable y is part of the description that should be returned by the query. Stallard notes that this is the crux of the referential/predicative distinction of metonymies.","In (0LFt), the NP-argument jets does not represent the domain of the wh-variable, but flight; does, thus indicating a metonymic reference and deriving a referential metonymy reading. In contrast, in (QLF2) the domain of the wh-variable coincides with the semantic type from the utterance (i.e.,"]},{"title":"airlines),","paragraphs":["but the subject-argument of the"]},{"title":"fly","paragraphs":["predicate is replaced by the coercion flights. This prompts Stallard to state that \"predicative","I (Or), (Q2), ({~LFt) and (qLF2) are borrowed from (StaJlard, 1993) 143 metonymy can be loosely thought of as coercion of a predicate place, rather than that of the argument NP itself\".","We argue that this definition is dependent on two factors: (1) the specific logical transforma-tion imposed by the DELPHI implementation, which does not cover forms of utterances other than wh-questions, and (2) the availability of thematic role relations and coercions tailored specifically for the ATIS domain. This characterization of referential/predicative metonymies is not applicable when processing different genres of text, operating in different domains and, thus needing a different knowledge representation. An example ofa metonymy resolution system using a more general representation is reported (Markert and Hahn, 1997).","In their model of metonymy inference, Markert and Hahn employ a two-tiered conceptual and semantic test: conceptual checks identify well-formed role chains between a pair of syntactically linked concepts, and then semantic checks distinguish whether these chains mirror literal or metonymic relation-ships. To perform these checks, they use (1) a concept hierarchy C with a taxonomic relation isac and (2) a set of relation names 7~, containing labels of all conceptual roles of the elements from C, hierarchically organized by isa~. For the ATIS domain, we can assume C = {AIRLINE, JET, MEAL, PASSENGER, PILOT .... } and 7~ -- {has-aircraft, has-flight, property-of' serves, fly-from, fly-to .... }.","To be able to parse texts, Markert and Hahn devised a system that grants a syntactic link between two concepts z and y if there is an acyclic path of relations ri E 7~ and concepts cj E C such that each ri is a conceptual role of ci-t, with ra,lge(ri)= ci and co = z A (c, isac. y V y isao ca).","Following established classifications (Lakoff and Johnson, 1990), Markert and Hahn predefine some of the relations from ~ as metonymic. These relations are {has-part, part-of, produced-by, contained-in, made-of}. Thus, a metonymy is recognized whenever one of the relations ri from a path is metonymic.","In this framework, the interpretation of the relation between x =airline and y =dinner in (Q1) is rendered by the Path-l: c0--company (with z\"=airline-isa-~company), rt-'has-part, ct= employee (with flight-attendant-isa-+ employee and range (serve, SUBJECT) = flight-attendant), r2=serve, c3=meal (with y--dinner-isa-+meal). Similarly, the interpretation of the conceptual relatedness between r--airline and y=Boston in (Q2) is rendered by the Path-2: co=airline, rt=has-flight, cl=scheduled-flight, r2=arrive-at, c3=city (with y--Boston-isa-~city).","The presence of rl=has-part in Path-I and of rt=has-flight in Path-2 indicates that the two"]},{"title":"!

In contrast, Path-2 has relation r2-arrive-at that coerces the wh-predicate fly-to from ({~2).","Markert and Hahn do not analyze the semantics of the metonymic paths, but instead distinguish referential and predicative metonyrnies only in the anaphoric cases. Considering that expression A is a metonymic coercion of the concept B, they assume that in the predicative case A should be available for reference resolution, whereas in the referential case, only B should be so. To be able to assess the availability for reference resolution, they search for the presence of A and B in the list of forward-looking centers of the previous sentences (thus using the functional centering framework defined in (Grosz et al., 1995)).","A similar path-finding methodology for deriving metonymies was used by the"]},{"title":"met*","paragraphs":["system (Fass, 1991), in which connections between the sense frames of textual concepts are retrieved from a lexicon of the size of 500 word senses.

In"]},{"title":"met*","paragraphs":["there is no support for distinctions between predicative and referential metonymies, since coercions are possible from any concept in a text. The appeal of this implementation stems from the fact that it uses word sense frames, inspired by the structure of dictionary entries and shows that the paths retrieved from such a knowledge representation can be used to identify classical forms of metonymy. This indicates that metonymy resolution can be performed by processing knowledge from lexical dictionaries, and therefore WordNet 1.6 is a suitable candidate.","A different methodology of deriving coercions was implemented in TACITUS (Hobbs et al., 1993). Whenever sortal constraints are violated, explicit arguments are replaced with coercion variables, related to the explicit arguments by generic relations. The coercion is devised when the generic relation subsumes some predicate that is brought forward by the abductive interpretation of the text. In the case of (Q1), argument"]},{"title":"jets","paragraphs":["is replaced with a coercion variable L- which is expected to satisfy the subject-constraints of the verb serve.

This gloss translates the generic relation between jets (a hyponym of airplanes) and variable k to the predicate on, cued by the prepositional relation attendant-on-+airplane. The interpretation of this prepositional relation is produced when it is matched against WordNet-based classes of prepositional attachments collected from large treebanks, following the methodology described in (Harabagiu, 1996). For this case, the on-prepositional relation attaches the place of work to the worker, thus giving meaning to the coercion of jets into flight attendants.","Although the coercions derived in TACITUS do not distinguish the predicative or referential cases, they present a different method of building metonymic paths. By incorporating this unification-based mechanism of producing coercions with a lexical path-finder working on WordNet, a novel way of deriving metonymies is made possible. It has the advantage that it relies only on approximations of sortal knowledge, as indirectly available from the WordNet database, and it does not need full-fledged abductions to be able to return metonymic paths. 3 Metonymic paths The process of deriving metonymic paths from WordNet consists of three distinct phases: (1) the identification of sortal constraints that need to be satisfied during the interpretation of nominal expressions, (2) the retrieval of related knowledge that complies with the sortal restrictions, and (3) the validation of coercions against anaphoric expressions from the sentences following the processed sentence. The first two phases rely on access to semantic information available in (1) the relational semantic encoded in WordNet (e.g.,"]},{"title":"hvpernyms, is_part, is_member, is_stuff\" entail","paragraphs":["or"]},{"title":"pertaymym)","paragraphs":["spanning synsets or words encoded in the database and (2) the semantic of the synset definitions (known as glosses). To be able to have computational access to the gloss semantic, synset definitions have been translated into logical formulae inspired by notation proposed in (Hobbs, 1986-1) and implemented in TAClTUS.","Based on the davidsonian treatment of action sentences, in which events are treated as individuals, every gloss is transformed in a first-order predicate formula for which (1) verbs are mapped in predicates"]},{"title":"t,erb(e,z.y)","paragraphs":["with the convention that variable e represents the eventuality of that action or event to take place, z represents the subject of the action. and Y represents its object (in the case of in-transitive verbs, Y is not attached to a predicate. whereas irt the case of bitransitive verbs, y is as-sumed to range over both the direct and indirect object); (b) nouns are mapped into their lexicalized predicates and (c) modifiers have the same argument as the predicate they modify. Prepositional attachments are indicated by preposition-predicates rang-ing over the pair of arguments of the predicates they attach.

The method does not presuppose the availability ofsortal constraints, but rather builds approximations ofsortai information from the knowledge implemented in WordNet. It uses two distinct approaches for knowledge coercion: one that relies on lexico-semantic information, another based on morphological links and unifying logic formulae (LF'rs) inferred from conceptual definitions. To evaluate this methodology of deriving metonymic coercions, a test set of 20 New York Times articles were parsed by FASTUS (Appelt et al., 1993) and used in conjunction with their coreference keys, as provided by the MUC test data. There were 1261 nominal expressions, distributed in four classes as illustrated in Table 1. A percentage of 23% nominals were anaphoric, out of which almost 74% had literal meaning. In approximating the sortal constraints, sorts for 68.2% of nominals were returned. When the sorts were not satisfied by searches through WordNet, metonymic paths were derived. As Table I indicates, 68.9% of these paths were lexico-semantic (denoted with r=-referential metonymies) and 31.1% were morpho-logical (denoted with p=predicative metonymies).

These results indicate that we need to experiment with different similarity measures. We also found that the metonymies have a significant contribution as knowledge sources for coreference resolution. 43% of the coreference keys were accounted by mere string matches. 3.1% by synonyms encoded in WordNet. 3.7% by hypernyms and 16.3% by links made possible through coercions.
