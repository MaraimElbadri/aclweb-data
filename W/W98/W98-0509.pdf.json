The approach aims at an increased level of robustness by accepting constraint violations in a controlled way, combining redundant and possibly conflicting information on different representational levels, and facilitating partial parsing as a natural mode of behavior. 1 Introduction Language understanding is based on a variety of contributions from different representational levels. From this perspective, one of the most attractive features of dependency based grammar models seems to be their relational nature which allows to accommodate various kinds of relationships in a very similar fashion. Since the basic representational framework is a rather general one it can be (re-)interpreted in many different ways. Thus, dependency relations lend themselves to model the surface syntactic structure of an utterance (with labels like subject-of, direct-object-of, determiner-of, etc.), its thematic structure (with labels like agent-of, theme-of, etc.) and even the referential structure (with labels like referential-identity, part-of, possessor-of, etc.). This representational similarity obviates the necessity to integrate too many disparate informational contributions into a single tree-like representation. Instead, representational levels can be separated from each other in a clean manner with appropriate mappings being defined to relate the different components to each other.","Another less obvious advantage of dependency formalisms is their suitability for the ap-Syn Sem : : : i Die"]},{"title":"Knochen sieht die Katze.

In contrast to the traditional view on parsing as a constructive process, which builds new tree structures from elementary building blocks and intermediate results, eliminative approaches or-ganize structural analysis as a candidate elimination procedure, removing unsuitable interpretations from a maximum set of possible ones. Hence, parsing is constructed as a strictly monotonic process of ambiguity reduction.","In this paper we describe different algorithmic solutions to eliminative parsing. The novel contribution consists in the use of graded constraints, which allow to model traditional grammar regularities as well as preferences and defaults. Details of the linguistic modeling are presented by Heinecke and SchrSder (1998). 2 Ellmlnative Parsing The idea of eliminative parsing is not a novel one and virtually every tagger can be considered a candidate elimination procedure which removes items from the maximum set of tags according to different decision criteria. Interestingly, dependency-based parsing can be viewed as a 78 generalized tagging procedure. One of the first parsing systems which built on this property is the Constraint Grammar approach (Karlsson et al., 1995). Underspecified dependency structures are represented as syntactic tags 1 and disambiguated by a set of constraints that exclude inappropriate readings. Maruyama (1990) first tried to extend the idea to allow the treatment of complete dependency structures. Therefore, he has to generalize the notion of a\"tag\" to pairs consisting of a label and the identifier of the dominating node, i. e., the tagset needs to become sensitive to the individual tokens of the utterance under consideration sacrificing the status of the tagset being fixed a-priori. As in the case of atomic tags, constraints are specified which delete inappropriate dependency relations from the initial space of possibilities. The approach is not restricted to linear input strings but can also treat lattices of input tokens, which allows to accommodate lexical ambiguity as well as recognition uncertainty in speech understanding applications (Harper et al., 1994).","Obviously, it is again the relational nature of dependency models which provides for the applicability of candidate elimination procedures. Since the initial state of the analysis is given by an - admittedly large - set of possible dependency relations per token, the problem space remains finite for finite utterances. An analogous approach for constituency-based grammar models would encounter considerable difficulties, because the number and the kind of non-terminal nodes which need to be included in the tagset remains completely unclear prior to the parsing itself.","Eliminative approaches to parsing come along with a number of interesting properties which make them particularly attractive as computational models for language comprehension.","1. As long as constraint checking is restricted to strictly local configurations of dependency relations the decision procedures in-herits this locality property and thus exhibits a considerable potential for concurrent implementation (Helzerman and","lIn this framework tags denote, for instance, the subject of the sentence, a determlner modifying a noun to the right, a preposition modifying a noun to the lei~ etc. However, only the category of the dominating node is specified, not its exact identity. 79 Harper, 1992).","2. Since partial structural descriptions are available concurrently they can be compared in a competitive manner. Note how-ever that such a comparison imposes additional synchronization and communication requirements on parallel realizations.","3. As the elimlnative approach considers parsing a procedure of disambiguation, the quality of the results to be expected becomes directly related to the amount of effort one is prepared to spend. This is a clear contrast to constructive methods which, upon request usually will attempt to generate alternative interpretations, thus leading to a corresponding decrease of clar-ity about the structural properties of the input utterance (in terms of Karlsson et al. (1995)).","4. The progress of disambiguation can easily be assessed by constantly monitoring the size of value sets. Moreover, under certain conditions the amount of remaining effort for obtaining a completely disambiguated solution can be estimated. This appears to be an important characteristic for the development of anytime procedures, which are able to adapt their behavior with respect to external resource limitations (Menzel, 1994; Menzel,"]},{"title":"1998).","paragraphs":["3 Graded Constraints Both the comparison of competitive structural hypotheses as well as the adaptation to resource limitations require to generalize the approach by allowing constraints of different strength. While traditional constraints only make binary decisions about the well-formedness of a configura-tion the strength of a constraint additionally refiects a human judgment of how critical a violation of that particular constraint is considered. Such a grading, expressed as a penalty factor, allows to model a number of observations which are quite common to linguistic structures:","â€¢ Many phenomena can more easily be described as preferences rather than strict regularities. Among them are structural conditions about attachment positions or linear ordering as well as selectional restrictions."]},{"title":"I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I","paragraphs":["Preferences usually reflect different frequencies of use and in certain cases can be extracted from large collections of sample data. Some linguistic cues are inherently uncertain (e. g., prosodic markers), and therefore resist a description by means of crisp rule sets.","By introducing graded constraints the parsing problem becomes an optimiT.ation problem aiming at a solution which violates constraints that are as few and as weak as possible. This, on the one hand, leads to a higher degree of structural disambiguation since different solution candidates now may receive a different score due to preference constraints. Usually, a complete disambiguation is achieved provided that enough preferential knowledge is encoded by means of constraints. Remaining ambiguity which cannot be constrained further is one of the major ditticulties for systems using crisp constraints (Harper et al., 1995). On the other hand, weighed constraints allow to handle contradictory evidence which is typical for cases of ill-formed input. Additionally, the gradings are expected to provide a basis for the realization of time adaptive behavior.","One of the most important advantages which can be attributed to the use of graded constraints is their ability to provide the mapping between different levels in a multi-level representation, where many instances of preferential relationships can be found. This separation of structural representations facilitates a clear modularization of the constraint grammar although constraints are applied to a single computational space. In particular, the propaga-tion of gradings between representational levels supports a mutual compensation of information deficits (e. g., a syntactic disambiguation can be achieved by means of semantic support) and even cross-level conflicts can be arbitrated (e. g., a syntactic preference might be inconsistent with a selectional restriction).","Combining candidate elimination techniques, graded constraints, and multi-level disambiguation within a single computational paradigm aims first of all at an increased level of robustness of the resulting parsing procedure (Menzel and Schr~der, 1998). Robustness is enhanced by 80 three different contributions: 1. The"]},{"title":"use of graded constraints","paragraphs":["makes constraint violations acceptable. In a certain sense, the resulting behavior can be considered a kind of constraint retraction which is guided by the individual gradings of violated constraints. Therefore, a \"blind\" weakening of the constraint system is avoided and hints for a controlled application are preserved. 2.

Naturally, the use of additional representational levels also means an expansion of the search space, but this undesired effect can be dealt with because once a single point of relative certainty has been found on an arbitrary level, the system can use it as an anchor point from which constraining information is propagated to the other levels. For in-stance, if selectional restrictions provide enough evidence for a particular solution, an ambiguous case can be resolved. Even contradictory indications can be treated in that manner. In such a case conflict resolu-tion is obtained according to the particular strength of evidence resulting from the observed constraint violations. 3.

Of course, these configurations need to be penalized appropriately in order to restrict their selection to those cases where no alternative interpretations remain.

This enables the grammar writer to carefully model the conditions under which non-projective dependency structures may occur. Note, however, that there are cases of non-projective structures that cannot be eliminated by using only local (i. e. at most binary) constraints.","Another problem arises from the fact that constraints are universally quantified and existence conditions (like \"there must be a subject for each finite verb\") c~nnot be expressed directly. This diilqculty, however, is easily over-come by the introduction of \"reverse\" dependencies on additional auxiliary levels, which are used to model the valency requirements of a dominating node. Since each valency to be saturated requires an auxiliary level, the overall number of levels in a multi-level representation may easily grow to more than some ten.","Moreover, the formal description given so far is only valid for linear strings but not for word graphs. An extension to the treatment of word graphs requires the modification of the notion of a problem candidate. While in the case of linear input an assignment of exactly one value to each variable represents a possible structure, this is not valid for word graphs. Instead, only those variables that correspond to a word hypothesis on one particular path through the word graph must receive a unique value while all other variables must be assigned no value at all. This additional path condition usually is also not encoded as normal grammar constraints but must be guaranteed by the control mechanism. 5 An Example To illustrate the formalization we now go through an example. To avoid unnecessary details we exclude the treatment of auxiliary levels from our discussion, thus restricting ourselves to the modeling of valency possibilities and ab-82 stracting from valency necessities. The problem is simplified further by selecting an extremely limited set of dependency labels. Consider again the example from Figure 1:","(I) Die Knochenpl siehtsg die Katzesg.

Basically, a constraint consists of a logical formula which is parameterized by variables (in our example X and Y) which can be bound to an edge in the dependency tree.

Selector functions are provided which facilitate access to the label of an edge (e. g., X.labe[) and to lexical properties of the dominating node (e. g., X1\"num) and the dominated one (e. g., X~num). Being universally quantified, a typical constraint takes the form of an implication with the premise describing the conditions for its application.

Some heuristic methods, for instance, try to arrive at a solution more efficiently at the expense of giving up the property of correctness, i. e., they find the globally best solution in most cases while they are not guaranteed to do so in all cases.","This allows to influence the temporal characteristics of the parsing procedure, a possibil-ity which seems especially important in interac-tive applications: If the system has to deliver a reasonable solution within a specific time interval a dynamic scheduling of computational resources depending on the remaining ambiguity and available time is necessary. While different kinds of search are more suitable with regard to the correctness property, local pruning strategies lend themselves to resource adaptive procedures. 6.1 Consistency-Based Methods As long as only crisp constraints are considered, procedures based on local consistency, particularly arc consistency can be used (Maruyama, 1990; Harper et al., 1995). These methods try to delete values from the domain of constraint variables by considering only local information and have a polynomial worst case complexity. 83 Unfortunately, they possibly stop deleting values before a unique solution has been found. In such a case, even if arc consistency has been established one cannot be sure whether the problem has zero, one, or more than one solution because alternative value assignments may be locally consistent, but globally mutually incompatible. Consequently, in order to find actual solutions an additional search has to be carried out for which, however, the search space is considerably reduced already. 6.2 Search The most straightforward method for constraint parsing is a simple search procedure where the constraint variables are successively bound to values and these value assignments are tested for consistency. In case of an inconsistency alternative values are tried until a solution is found or the set of possible values is exhausted. The basic search algorithm is Branch & Bound which exploits the fact that the score of every subset of variable assignments is already an upper bound of the final score. Additional constraint violations only make the score worse, bemuse the scores of constraints do not exceed a value of one. Therefore, large parts of the search space can be abandoned as soon as the score becomes too low. To further ~ improve the efficiency an agenda is used to sort the search space nodes so that the most promising candidates are tried first. By not allowing the agenda to grow larger than a specified size, one can exclude search states with low scores from further consideration. Note that correctness cannot be guaranteed in that case anymore. Figure 4 presents the algorithm in pseudo code notation.","Unfortunately, the time requirements of the search algorithms are almost unpredictable since an intermediate state of computation does not give a reliable estimation of the effort that remains to be done. 6.3 Pruning As explained in Section 6.1 consistency-based procedures use local information to delete values from the domain of variables. While these methods only do so if the local information suffices to guarantee that the value under consideration can safely be deleted, pruning goes one step further.

Additional techniques have to be employed to decrease actual computation times. One of the starting points for such improvements is the extremely large number of constraint evaluations during parsing: A few million constraint checks are quite common for realistic grammars and sentences of even modest size.","Two approaches seem to be suitable for the reduction of the number of constraint evaluations:","â€¢ Reduced application of constraints: A detailed analysis of how constraints are applied and under what circumstances they fail shows that most constraint checks are Figure 8: Window of the graphical grammar environment xcdg 86 '~seless\" since the tested constraint is satisfied for some trivial reason. For in-stance, because most constraints are very specific about what levels are constrained and whether and how the dependency edges are connected, this information can be exploited in order to reduce the number of constraint checks. By applying constraints only to the relevant levels the number of constraint evaluation has been cut down to (at most) 40%. Taking into account the topological structure of the edges under consideration improves the efficiency by another 30% to 50%. Reduction of the number of constraint variables: A typical grammar contains a relatively large number of representational levels and for most word forms there are several entries in the lexicon. Since the lexical ambiguity of the word form usually is relevant only to one or very few levels, constraint variables need not be established for all lexical entries and all levels. For in-stance, the German definite determiner die has eight different morpho-syntactic feature combinations if one only considers varia-tions of gender, case, and number. All these forms behave quite similarly with respect to non-syntactic levels. Consequently, it makes no difference if one merges the constraint variables for the non-syntactic levels except that now less constraint checks must be carried out. By considering the relevance of particular types of lexical ambiguity for constraint variables of different levels one achieves an efficient treatment of disjunctive feature sets in the lexicon (Foth, 1998). This technique reduced the time requirements by 75% to 90% depending on the details of the grammatical modeling. In particular, a clean modularization, both in the constraint set and the dictionary entries, results in considerable gains of efficiency.","In order to support the grammar writer, a graphical grammar environment has been devel-","â€¢ oped (cf.

The approach improves in robustness by assessing partial structures, integrating multiple representational levels, and employing partial parsing techniques. Knowledge about the grammar but also extralinguistic information about the domain under consideration is encoded by meaus of graded constraints which allows for the arbitration between conflicting information. Different decision procedures for the defined parsing problem have been introduced and some efficiency issues have been discussed. The approach has successfully been applied to a number of modestly sized projects (Menzel and Schr~Sder, 1998; Heinecke et al., 1998). Further investigations will focus on possibilities for incremental processing of speech input and the realization of resource adaptive behavior. References Kilian Foth. 1998.
