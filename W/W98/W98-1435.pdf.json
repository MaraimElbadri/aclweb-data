Coch, ERLI 261, rue de Paris","93556 Montreuil Cedex, FRANCE jose.coch@erli.fr-1. Several important problems to solve for applying Generation to the real world We believe that it is important from the practical point of view to use natural language generation (NLG) in real world applications. The key benefits are outlined as follows: • Higher quality of generated texts • Cost effective maintenance and adaptability","• Usability•(including acceptability by the users). Generally, it takes \"exotic\" (linguists, knowledge engineers) manpower to maintain, and adapt a NLG system. To avoid this problem, we have developed a Knowledge Administration • station, which is usable by the target population (in our project, weather forecasters). On the other hand, the system is designed to help the forecasters and not replace them. It is able to adapt to each forecaster's style and manage enhancements• they wish to bring to their texts. With that in mind, the Interactive Generation environment was designed to allow forecasters to modify generated texts in their native language, and then generate weather forecasts in several foreign languages based on those modifications. Interactive• Generation is a viable alternative to Automatic Translation. 2. MultiMeteo 2.1. General motivation The European weather forecast market is no longer limited to the national level. Travelling is growing rapidly, with an increasing number of people going abroad, for both personal and professional reasons. Markets for meteorological forecasts tend to overlap borders and thus need multilingual tools. The volumes involved are high, and time constraints for producing fresh usable information are stringent: several hundreds of bulletins for each Weather Office, produced several times a day. End users have also become• much more demanding about quality and tailoring, which here are realised by different styles of weather forecast. 1.2. Goal and characteristics of MultiMeteo The g0al of the MultiMeteo projectis to build an automatic multilingual short-report generation system, and to use it in the Meteorology field for producing weather forecasts from structured data I. i Other weather-forecast generation systems are FoG [Goldberg et al. 94], Weathra [Sigurt et al. 92], MET90 [Sigurt et al. 96], and METEOVIS [Kerpedjiev & Noncheva 90] 300"]},{"title":"I I I I ii il I iI","paragraphs":["This system will allow European forecasters to automatically produce texts in English, French, German, Spanish, and Dutch. MultiMeteo is a 3-year project funded partially by the Language Engineering programme of the European Commission, and partially by European weather offices. It involves around 40 people in France, Spain, Austria and Belgium. There are around 15 pilot sites in Europe, which are representative of different meteorological characteristics (south, north, plain, mountain, sea, etc.). In each site, 3 or 4 styles willbe developed (local and regional general public, seaside general public, fun-board sport oriented, etc.)."]},{"title":"3.","paragraphs":["Interactive Generation"]},{"title":"and Knowledge","paragraphs":["Administration The Interactive Generation environment allows the user (the forecaster)to: • Read the generated text • Modify it in terms of concepts, modifiers, links, etc. • • Read the modified version The following example shows a generated text, and the menu proposed by the system when the user clicks on a clause (here \"le ciel couvert devient peu nuageux\") - \"the grey sky becomes less cloudy\"","-, .~ ~ I.,,~t:~;~-.~ \", ---~"]},{"title":"I UEII I","paragraphs":["METEO-FRANCE, centre departemental du Mans.

Certain functions are specific to the central administration, such as the creation of a new style from scratch, or the management of the multilingual terminology. • 4. Technical Characteristics MultiMeteo runs under PC/Windows 95 (or more), Windows NT and Unix station/Solaris2. The input is a numerical matrix, where columns are the meteorological parameters and rows are time steps. The output is an HTML or RTF file that contains one or more weather forecasts. 302","• i I"]},{"title":"!

The FEM, the Administration, and the Help are written in JAVA. The Generation Server is based on ERLI's AlethGen toolbox, which has already been used for generating texts, in particular for producing correspondence for a leading French mail-order company (see [Coch 1996a] and [Coch 1996b]). AlethGen is divided in an engine (written in C++) and Knowledge Bases.
