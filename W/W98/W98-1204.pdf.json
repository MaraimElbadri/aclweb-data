It accomplishes this through the use of learned or handcrafted patterns. In the ideal case the results lead to an appropriate reaction, executed by the computer itself (see Figure 1). The extracted information is stored in a template that usually is based on a slot-and-filler model. Whenever the textual information does not fit automatically into the fillers, it has to be changed adequately to the form and content requirements of the template, otherwise the text is rejected. Thus, the templates architecture depends very much on the domain the IE--system was built for, i.e. before processing a text or a message and starting the linguistic analysis, the category that the text or message belong to is already","This study is part of the project READ.

The problem gets worse when the information that has to be extracted is paper-bound and has to be digitized by scanners to make the information available to the computer, because Optical Character Recognition (= OCR) still garbles a consLderable amount of information reduction and noise on texts, so that there is also a need for more robust information extraction systems that handle Schneider 19 Lexically-Intensive Algorithm Ren~ Schneider (1998) A Lexically-lntensive Algorithm for Domain-Specific Knowledge Acquisition.

This keeps their knowledge bases and the rules that are needed to process the texts, e.g. the syntactic rules, quite compact. But nevertheless, the changes that have to be done whenever a working system is applied to another domain are remarkably high, in some cases leading to the construction of a almost completely new knowledge base.","Both, the construction of a new knowledge base and their maintenance need a certain time and lots of efforts have to be done by highly-skilled staff know-ing the system and the domain it is built for. On the other hand, texts or messages that are written for a very specific purpose show the phenomena of Sublanguages (Harris, 1982), with less ambiguities and varieties than unrestricted language but still more freedom in expression than Controlled Languages. This fact strengthens the need for the automatic acquisition of linguistic knowledge, esp. the construction of a lemmatisation and a shallow parsing component.","Statistical learning algorithms are usually applied to processing large corpora, but in real life, huge samples are hard to find for commercial and industrial applications. In our case, the corpora usually consist of small samples of fewer than 150 very short texts and the whole sample must be split into a training and a test corpora. This disadvantages are compensated by the use of a domain-specific sublanguage. Any sublanguage shows some use of typical vocabulary, styles, and grammatical constructions, and it can be said that the more specific the domain is, the stronger are the restrictions of the sublanguage. But even in categories where these restrictions are weak, the essential and relevant information is carried by some typical words and located in a few kernel phrases, so that even simple statistics like frequency lists, distance measures and weighted collocation patterns may overcome parts of the acquisition problem (see section 4). 2.2 The Noisy-Channel-Problem The second major problem is concerned with the fact that still a remarkably high number of paper-bound texts have to be pre-processed by an OCR-System in order to convert them into machinereadable code. This problem can be compared to the well known problem of a noisy channel, as indicated in Figure 2. INPUT OUTPUT • e 1 1 I I Figure 2: An Example of a Noisy Channel in OCR","Therefore, the development of OCR systems and the improvement of their efficiency is still a major task in the area of document processing. But even with high quality scanners, the promised 99.9% recognition rate is difficult to achieve (Taghva et al., 1994) and remains the ideal case due to e.g. the use of different fonts, low quality print or paper, a low resolution etc.","Besides the mistakes caused by OCR, a considerable number of documents include typographical or grammatical mistakes (misspellings, wrong inflec-tion or word order), unusal expressions etc., which shows that natural language processing (NLP) needs more than just a grammar for grammatical expressions but indeed has to be fault-tolerant to process ~real-world\" utterances. Though natural language itsdf has a lot to do with exceptions and irregularities, all these nuisances amplify the problems NLP is occupied with, but -- as a glance at text samples shows -- IE,-systems are faced with a considerable number of these additional irregularities that occur","• as a result of low grammatical competence, e.g. whenever a non-native speaker is obliged to write a document or message in a second language;","• as careless slips, e.g. misspellings, missing punctuations etc.","However, the most of all occurring errors are produced by OCR 1 and can be classified as follows:","ZA brief example of an OCR-text: I/e would be vBry pleasd ifyou could send two 1992 annuai reports and a product brochure to: -.."]},{"title":"Schneider 20 Lexically-lntensive Algorithm II !1 II II II II II Ii II II II II II I!

The different techniques were derived from the fields of symbolic, connectionist, statistical and evolutionary computing and their application depends on the specific problem. Recent developments show that the consecutive or simultaneous combination of different learning approaches, i.e. hybrid strategies, often leads to better results than the single use of one. The methodology most frequently used to support other learning strategies are statistics, but in several occasion they are also used exclusively, esp. when the a priori knowledge about the content and the structure of the data is very low (Vapnik, 1995).","In such cases, all that is needed to start with, is the knowledge about some functional properties of the data to deduce their dependencies. Simply speaking, an unordered or hidden structure is transformed into a systematic structure revealing the properties, relations and processes of the data.

The domain-specific words can be seen as distinctive from all other words since they describe the domain and general purpose the text has been written for, whereas the text-relevant words stand in a close relation to the domain--specific data because they usually do not appear alone but determine exactly the meaning of the domain-specific words.

Thinking in categories of natural language, the domain-specific information represents the pragmatic meaning and uses verbs and specific nouns to describe specific events while the text-relevant information is represented through names, numbers, dates etc. In any case it has to be considered that this distinction depends very much on the sharpness of the domain the IF_c-System is built for. Generally speaking, the more specific a domain is, the better does this distinction work and thus facilitates both the construction of the output structure (templates) and the extraction of the relevant text features.","Unfortunately -- as will be seen in the next section -- text-relevant information is very difficult to learn automatically, particularly when the texts that are analyzed have been damaged by OCR: e.g. the differences of report and roport can easily be detected and resolved, whereas names of persons, streets etc. themselves have several spelling variants and the change of a single letter changes the whole meaning, as it happens for numbers, too.","Therefore the main focus is on the the detection of domain-specific information with statistical methods that leads in a following step to the text-relevant information, i.e. the major task of the algorithm is to build automatically a knowledge base for the crucial words and the kernel phrases that represent the salient information of a given text.","4 Lexically-Intensive Knowledge Acquisition 4.1 An Outline of the Algorithm The algorithm as illustrated in Figure 4 is divided into the following major steps: First, a frequency list is computed from the training data, i.e. the raw text of a limited number of texts belonging to the same domain. Then, all word forms are compared with each other and the word forms with a low distance are grouped together. The results from these two procedures are combined and lead to the construction of a very compact core lexicon that consists of a limited number of entries with lexical prototypes and automatically assigned variants of the corpus' word forms. Afterwards the training data is trans-Figure 4: Building a Domain-Specific Lexicon formed so that it only consists of the automatically derived lexical prototypes. Then the most frequent syntagmatic patterns from a length of two to five lemmata are collected and weighted. In the last but one step similar patterns having at least one domain-specific lexeme in Common are collected to reveal the neighbourhoods of the most important words. The degree-of-interest of a word is computed from its frequency and the number of variants the word has. Finally the entries of the core lexicon are connected with one another and compressed into weighted regular expressions. The result is a domain-specific lexicon that is represented as a net of lexical entries covering the correct word and their variants and some of the possible incorrect variants and the syntactical relations that are commonly used in texts of a certain domain. 4.2 Acquisition of Lexical Knowledge The construction of the core lexicon is based on the combination of a frequency list and a comparision of the distances of all word forms given in a corpus of"]},{"title":"Schneider","paragraphs":["22"]},{"title":"Lexically-lntensive Algorithm II II II II II Ii Iii II II II II / II II II II II II !1 II II","paragraphs":["ca. one hundred texts. 2","A computation of the relative size of unknown and already known word (see Figure 5) shows that after a very low number of texts generally 80 % of the information is confirmed, i.e. it appeared already in one of the former texts.

An effective method for the measurement of word distances is the Levenshtein distance in combination with an adequate threshold value (Nerbonne et al., 1996),","2In this paper we focus on the results of a training corpus of business letter requests in english with a total number of only 7,078 word forms distributed over 100 texts.

Any two words are compared with each other in a distance matrix, which measures the least effort of transforming one word into the other. Least effort means the lowest number of insertions, deletions, or replacements (as a combination of deletion and insertion). The effort is norrealized to the length of the longest word in order to obtain a ratio-scaled value. Table 1 gives the example of an unordered lexicon entry for the word form rbport with all similar words that were found in the corpus, having a Levenshtein distance lower than 0.9 3. As already postulated in Hypothesis 1, the number of correct and \"deflected\" forms is always higher than those of typical OCR-mistakes. In fact it must be asked, whether typical OCR mistakes exist at all due to the different types of reasons for these mistakes and the multitude of effects they may have.","For every word with one or more similar words as determined by a threshold value of 0.9, a preliminary entry was created as illustrated in Table 1, covering the most important morphological deriva-","STo facilitate and shorten the work of the algorithm, the alphabet was divided into interpretable signs (a-Z, 0-9, punctuation) and non-interpretable signs (like *, -, ̂etc.) which were converted into a middle point (,) .

To diminish this redundancy, it is necessary","• to drop those words having a high distance and showing no linguistic relation to the other words in the entries and","• to make a clear distinction between a lemma and its variants. Therefore the multitude of preliminary lexical entries was reduced to a very compact core lexicon as exampled in Table 2 and described as follows.","The algorithm processes successively through the frequency list, starting with the most frequent word and finishing with the last hapax legomenon. Each word that can be found in the frequency list is considered as the top of a new lexicon entry or lemma. Afterwards, the algorithm looks for the word forms in the preliminary lexicon, that are similar to this word (having a distance smaller than 0.4), assigns them as variants in the new entry and recursively looks for all variants of the previously assigned variants (having a distance smaller than 0.7). Each one of these variants can no longer be regarded as top of another entry and consequently is taken out of the frequency lists, that simultaneously shrinks more and more. The variants' frequency is added to that of the lemma.","The results of the algorithm depend a lot on an a priori specified treshold value for the Levenshtein distances. In our tests, good results are achieved with a value of 0.4 for direct similarity and 0.7 for indirect similarity, meaning the newly computed distance of variants of a variant to a given lemma. The threshold value may depend on the language and the domains that are used. This aspect will be further investigated.","The result of this process is a core lexicon that consists of","• high frequent synsemantica or function words having no variants,","• high frequent, domain specific autosemantica or content words and most of their occuring variants,","• middle and low frequency words and their variants, and","• one single entry for all the remaining hapax legomena having no similarity to one of the preceding words lower than 0.4, Stem report E Variants reports 0.142 reprt 0.166 repo 0.333 repOrt 0.333 rbport 0.333 ofreports 0.333 reporting 0.333 reporting• 0.4 roports 0.428 fjeport 0.428 repoii 0.666 sports 0.666 repods 0.666 13 D.istanc.e [ f req 88 61 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 163 Table 2: Core Lexicon Entry: report in order of their summarized frequencies.

This increases the number of documents that can be analyzed by the IE-system considerably. The wrong assignment of sports as a variant of report shows the domain dependency of the algorithm, but it has to be considered that the frequency of such wrong assignments generally is 1 and can be compensated by the extraction of syntactical patterns. 4.3 Acquisition of Syntactical Knowledge The core lexicon bears the basic lexical knowledge that is needed for a morphological text analysis and furthermore can be used to \"clean\" documents from noisy sequences but it does not store any information about the syntagmatic relations or dependencies that exist in texts of a given domain. To reveal these dependencies, the original corpus was transformed into a lemmatized version, consisting only of the earlier derived prototypes and \"Weighted Ranks\" for words with the frequency 1 having no similarity to other words.

The method was tested empirically on several english, german and spanish corpora and shows the same results for noisy as well as for correct domain-specific corpora.","A comparison of the core lexicon with common frequency analyses (Francis and Ku~era, 1982) for correct texts shows that even with a very small text sample the resulting information for linguistically allowed alterations of a lexical base form is acquired automatically. Additional information is achieved with the subsumption of linguistically incorrect variants. The acquired knowledge is stored in a compact and dynamic knowledge base whose structure is modified with every significant change of the lexeme's probabilistic properties and relations. The knowledge base is quite compact and allows a very quick analysis of unknown texts.","First tests with different corpora and different languages (German and Spanish) show that this algorithm can be applied to different domains and other languages and thus is a useful tool for the expansion of IE-systems that work with OCR--data. Although the results of the algorithm depend very much on the data, i.e. the limits or sharpness of the domain which is used, the underlying ideas may be used for any information extraction purpose and other applications such as lexicography, information retrieval or terminology extraction. 7 Acknowledgements I wish to thank Ingrid Renz and Uli Bohnacker for all the ideas, suggestions and comments that found their way into this paper."]},{"title":"Schneider","paragraphs":["27"]},{"title":"Lexically-Intensive Algorithm","paragraphs":["References Steven Abney. 1996.
