The construction of such a corpus (a treebank) is a time-consuming task that can hardly be carried out unless some annotation work is automated. Purely automatic annotation, however, is not reliable enough to be employed without some form of human supervision and hand-correction. This interactive annotation strategy requires tools for error detection and consistency checking.","The present paper reviews our experience with the development of automatic annotation tools which are currently used for building a corpus of German newspaper text.","The next section gives an overview of the annotation format. Section 3 describes three applications of statistical NLP methods to treebank annotation. Finally, section 4 discusses mechanisms for comparing structures assigned by different annotators."]},{"title":"2 Annotating Argument Structure","paragraphs":["2.1 Annotation Scheme Unlike most treebanks of English, our corpus is annotated with predicate-argumenl s~ructures and not phrase-structure trees.

(Skut et al., 1997a). For more details on the annotation scheme v.

As we do not want to abandon the annotate-and-compare strategy, additional effort has been put into the development of tools supporting the comparison of annotated structures (see section 4). 3 Automation The efficiency of annotation can be significantly increased by using automatic annotation tools. Nevertheless, some form of human supervision and hand-correction is necessary to ensure sufficient reliability.

Thus in most treebank projects, the task of the annotators consists in correcting the output of a parser, cf. (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1994), (Black et al., 1996).","As for our project, the unavailability of broad-coverage argument-structure and dependency parsers made us adopt a bootstrapping strategy. Having started with completely manual annotation, we axe gradually increasing the degree of automation. The corpus annotated so far serves as training material for annotation tools based on statistical NLP methods, and the degree of automation increases with the amount of annotated sentences.","Automatic processing and manual input are combined interactively: the annotator specifies some information, another piece of information is added automatically, the annotator adds new information or corrects parts of the structure, new parts are added automatically, and so on. The size and type of such annotation increments depends on the size of the training corpus. Currently, manual annotation consists in specifying the hierarchical structure, whereas category and function labels as well as simple sub-structures are assigned automatically. These automation steps are described in the following sections. 3.1 Tagging Grammatical Functions Assigning grammatical functions to a given hierarchical structure is based on a generalization of standard paxt-of-speech tagging techniques.","In contrast to a standard probabilistic POS tagger (e.g. (Cutting et al., 1992; Feldweg, 1995)), the tagger for grammatical functions works with lexical"]},{"title":"(1) Selbst besucht","paragraphs":["ADV VVPP himself visited hat Peter Sabine VAFIN NE NE has Peter Sabine"]},{"title":"'Peter never visited Sabine himself' l hie ADV never","paragraphs":["Figure 2: Example sentence and contextual probability measures"]},{"title":"PO.(')","paragraphs":["depend-ing on the category of a mother node (Q).

The task is performed by an extension of the grammatical function tagger presented in the previous section.","Recall that each phrasal category defines a different Markov model. Given the categories of the children nodes in a phrase, we can run these models in parallel.

In general, this task is much more difficult than assigning category and function labels, and requires a significantly larger training corpus than the one currently available. What can be done at the present stage is the recognition of relatively simple structures such as NPs and PPs.","(Church, 1988) used a simple mechanism to mark the boundaries of NPs.

The first reason is that the annotation increments are rather small, so the annotator corrects not an entire parse tree, but a fairly simple local structure. The automatic assignment of phrase and function labels is generally more reliable than manual input because it is free of typically human errors (see the precision results in (Brants, Skut, and Krenn, 1997)). Thus the annotator can concentrate on the more difficult task, i.e., building complex syntactic structures.","The second reason is that errors corrected at lower levels in the structure facilitate the recognition of structures at higher levels, thus many wrong readings are excluded by confirming or correcting a choice at a lower level.","The partial automation of the annotation process (automatic regocnition of phrase labels and grammatical functions) has reduced the average annotation time from about 10 to 1.5 - 2 minutes per sentence, i.e. 600 - 800 tokens per minute, which is comparable to the figures published by the creators of the Penn Treebank in (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1994).","The test version of the annotation tool using the statistical chunking technique described in section 3.3 permits even larger annotation increments and we expect a further increase in annotation speed.

The program assigns a sequence of structural tags to them; these tags are then converted to a tree structure and all labels are inserted. 3.5 tteliability To make automatic annotation more reliable, the program assigning labels performs an additional reliability check. We do not only calculate the best assignment, but also the second-best alternative and its probability. If the probability of the alternative comes very close to that of the best sequence of labels, we regard the choice as unreliable, and the annotator is asked for confirmation.","Currently, we employ three reliability levels, expressed by quotients of probabilities Pbest/Psecond-If this quotient is close to one (i.e., smaller than some threshold 01), the decision counts as unreliable, and annotation is left to the annotator. If the quotient is very large (i.e., greater than some threshold 02 > 91), the decision is regarded as reliable and the respective annotation is made by the program.","If the quotient fails between 91 and 02, the decision is tagged as \"almost reliable\". The annotation is inserted by the program, but has to be confirmed by the annotator.","This method enables the detection of a number of errors that are likely to be missed if the annotator is not asked for confirmation.","The results of using these reliability levels are reported in the experiments section below. 3.6 Experiments This section reports on the accuracy achieved by the methods described in the previous sections.","At present, our corpus contains approx. 6300 sentences (115,000 tokens) of German newspaper text (Frankfurter Rundschan). Results of tagging grammatical functions and phrase categories have improved slightly compared to those reported for a smaller corpus of approx. 1200 sentences (Brants, Skut, and Krenn, 1997). Accuracy figures for tagging the hierarchical structure are published for the first time.","For each experiment, the corpus was divided into two disjoint parts: 90% training data and 10% test data. This procedure was repeated ten times, and the results were averaged.","The thresholds 01 and 02 determining the reliability levels were set to 91 = 5 and 02 = 100. 3.6.1 Grammatical Functions","We employ the technique described in section 3.1 to assign grammatical functions to a structure defined by an annotator.

It depends on the category of the phrase, e.g. accuracy for reliable cases reaches 99% for 51Ps and PPs. 3.6.2 Phrasal Categories","Now the task is to assign phrasal categories to a structure specified by the annotator, i.e., only the hierarchical structure is given. We employ the technique of competing Markov models as described in section 3.2 to assign phrase categories to the structure. Additionally, we compute alternatives to assign one of the three reliability levels to each decision as described in section 3.5. The tagset for phrasal categories consists of 25 tags.","As can be seen from table 2, the results of assigning phrasal categories are even better than those of assigning grammatical functions.

The accuracy figures presented here refer to the correct assignments of these tags (see table 3).","The assignment of structural tags allows us to construct a tree; the labels are afterwards assigned in a bottom-up fashion by the function/category label tagger described in earlier sections.","Overall accuracy is 94.4% and reaches 95.8% in the reliable cases.","A different measure of the chunker's correctness is the percentage of complete phrases recognized correctly. In order to determine this percentage, we extracted all chunks of the maximal depth recognizable by the chunker. In a cross evaluation, 87.3% of these chunks were recognized correctly as far as the hierarchical structure is concerned. 4 Comparing Trees Annotations produced by different annotators are compared automatically and differences are marked. The output of the comparison is given to the annotators. First, each of the annotators goes through the differences on his own and corrects obvious errors. Then remaining differences are resolved in a discussion of the annotators.","Additionally, the program calculates the probabilities of the two different annotations. This is in-tended to be a first step towards resolving conflicting annotations automatically.

This section presents an extension of this algorithm that compares predicate-argument structures possibly containing crossing branches (cf. figure 2). Node and edge labels, representing phrasal categories and grammatical functions, are also taken into account.","Phrasal (non-terminal) nodes are compared on the basis of their yields: the yield of a nonterminal node X in an annotation A is the ordered set of terminals that are (directly or indirectly) dominated by X. The yield need not be contiguous since predicate-argument structures allow discontinuous constituents.","If both annotations contain nonterminal nodes that cover the same terminal nodes, the labels of the nonterminal nodes and their edges are compared.","This results in a combined measure of structural and labeling differences, which is very useful in cleaning the corpus and keeping track of the development of the treebank.","We use the basic algorithm shown in figure 4 to determine the differences in two annotations A and B. The basic form is asymmetric. Therefore, a complete comparison consists of two runs, one for each direction, and the outputs of both runs are combined.","Figures 5 and 6 show examples of the output of the algorithm. These outputs can be directly used to mark the corresponding nodes and edges.","The yield is sufficient to uniquely determine corresponding nodes since the annotations used here do not contain unary branching nodes. If unary branching occurs, both the parent and the child have the same terminal yield and further mechanism to determine corresponding nodes are needed.
