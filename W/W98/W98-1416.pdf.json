If the Analyzer indicates that the argument is not nice enough, i.e., there is not sufficient belief in the•goal in the user or the normative model, then the Strategist re-activates the Generator in order to find further support for the premises in the argument, and so on.- The generation-analysis cycle continues until a sufficiently nice Argument Graph is generated. This graph is then passed to the Argument Presenter, which selects an argumentation strategy and determines propositions to be removed from the argument, aiming to produce a simpler, enthymematic argument. After each removal, the Presenter activates the Analyzer to check whether theargument is still nice and the Attentional Mechanism to determine whether the argument can still be followed by the user.","Thus, the Attentional Mechanism is used in two different stages of the argumentation process.

This is analogous to the way in which NAG uses spreading activation to focus on a small portion of the available data during the content planning process. Walker (1996) points out the effect of attentional focus on discourse comprehension. This effect is taken into consideration by NAG during argument presentation.","The approach of \"interpretation as abduction\" used in [Hobbs et al., 1993].aims to recover the premises and inferential links which lead to an argument's conclusion. This is similar to NAG's argument analysis. The most important difference between NAG and the work by Hobbs et al., in addition to NAG being a system that reasons under uncertainty, is that NAG performs both analysis and generation. A generative system based on the work of Hobbs et al. is described in [Thomason et aL, 1996]. This system deals with what can be readily inferred, and so deleted, during communication, but the generated discourse does not argue in favour of a proposition. Mehl (1994) describes a system which can turn an existing fully explicit argument into an enthymematic one, but it cannot generate an argument from constituent propositions. The system described in [Horacek, 1997] generates its own arguments and presents them enthymematically. However, neither process models explicitly a user's attentional state.","Like NAG, the systems described in [Reed and Long, 1997, Huang and Fiedler, 1997] consider focus of attention during argument presentation. NAG differs from these systems in that NAG also uses attentional focus to guide the content planning process. In addition, Reed and Long consider attention in order to generate additional information that makes a concept salient, and Huang and Fiedler use a limited implementation of attentional focus to select which step in a proof should be mentioned next. In Contrast, NAG uses attentional focus during argument presentation to convert a fully explicit argument into an enthymematic one. Finally, Fehrer and Horacek (1997) take advantage of mathematical properties to structure certain types of mathematical proofs. They model a user's inferential ability by means of specialized substitution rules, but offer no mechanism (such as attention in NAG) to limit the number of applications of their rules."]},{"title":"3 The Generation-Analysis Cycle","paragraphs":["NAG receives the following inputs: (1) a proposition to be argued for, (2) an initial argument context, and (3) two target ranges of degrees of belief to be achieved (one each for the normative model and the user model). The argument context is composed of salient propositions and concepts appearing in the discussion 149 preceding the argument or in the current Argument Graph. The initial argument context, contexto, is composed of salient propositions and concepts mentioned in the preamble to the argumen t plus the argument's goal. The degrees of belief to be achieved are expressed as ranges of probabilities, e.g., [0.5, 0.6], in order to be able to represent a variety of goals, e.g., inducing indifference or assent. Two target ranges are required since the degree of belief to be reached by the user may differ from that reached by the system.","When constructing an argument, NAG relies on two collections of information: a normative •model composed of different types of Knowledge Bases (KBs), and a user model also composed of different types of KBs, which represent the user's presumed beliefs and inferences. A KB represents information in a single format, e.g., semantic network (SN), Bayesian network (BN), rule-based system, or database. The KBs in the normative and user models are consulted by specialist Reasoning Agents which are activated when trying to fill gaps in a partial argument (Section 5). The KBs in the user model are consulted to make an argument persuasive for the target audience, while the normative KBs are consulted so that the generated argument is normatively correct. This distinction between the normative correctness and the persuasiveness of an argument enables the system to control the extent to which it will sacrifice normative correctness in order to be persuasive. During argument generation, relevant material from several KBs may need to be combined into a common representation. We have chosen BNs for this purpose because of •their ability to represent normatively correct reasoning •under uncertainty, and because simple alterations of the normal Bayesian propagation rules allow us to model various human cognitive phenomena [Korb et al., 1997]. •","The content planning process produces an Argument Graph which starts from admissible premises and ends in the goal proposition. Admissible premises are normatively acceptable propositions that are believed by NAG and are either believed the user (sufficiently for the argument to work) or assented to by the user. The resultant Argument Graph is then passed to the Presenter. The argument generation process is implemented by the following algorithm, which is executed by the Strategist."]},{"title":"Generation-Analysis Algorithm","paragraphs":["1. i +-- 0. 2.

For content planning, the initial context consists of the goal proposition and salient concepts and propositions mentioned in the preamble of the argument; as the content planning process progresses, the context is extended with concepts and propositions included in the argument. For argument presentation, the context initially contains the propositions of the first sub-argument to be presented under a particular presentation strategy, and moves on to different propositions as the presentation of the argument pro~esses (Section 7).","We use activation with decay [Anderson, 1983], spreading from the current context, to model the focus of attention. All items in the semantic-Bayesian networks which achieve a threshold activation level during the spreading activation process are brought into the current span of attention. This process passes activation through the pyramidal semantic-Bayesian networks, each node being activated to the degree implied by the activation levels of its neighbours, the strength of association to those neighbours, and its immediately prior activation level (vitiated by a time-decay factor). The spreading activation process ceases when an activation cycle fails to activate any new node. By these means we have a direct implementation of attention which we use to identify portions of the pyramidal semantic-Bayesian networks that are strongly related to the argument being built or presented.","During content planning, spreading activation is applied to both the semantic-Bayesian pyramid in the user model and that in the normative model. This supports the retrieval of information that is semantically connected, and hence likely to be useful for building an argument, from each of the models. Further, the items in the initial context and in subsequent, extended contexts are clamped, since they are used for reasoning, and their level of activation should not fade as the system reasons about the argument. In contrast, during argument presentation, spreading activation is performed only in the semantic-Bayesian pyramid in the user model, and salient information items are not clamped. This is because we are trying to anticipate the effect of the information being presented on the addressee, and information presented earlier will fade from the addressee's focus of attention [Walker, 1996].","The Attentional Mechanism offers the following advantages. During content planning, it allows NAG to restrict its search to information semantically or evidentially connected with the propositions already in focus, and it enables NAG to analyze its arguments with respect to just these propositions (Section 6). During argument presentation, it supports the generation of enthymematic arguments by assessing the omission of propositions that are in the addressee's span of attention (as a result of the presentation of other propositions)."]},{"title":"5 Argument Extension","paragraphs":["The Generator activates the Reasoning Agents to collect information relevant to each of the subgoals in the current Argument Graph (these subgoals were identified in Step 3 of the Generation-Analysis algorithm).

The Analyzer computes the new belief in a proposition by combining the previous belief in it with the result of applying the inferences which precede this proposition in the Argument Graph. This belief computation process is performed by applying Bayesian propagation procedures to the Bayesian subnetwork corresponding tothe current Argument Graph in the user model and separately to the subnetwork corresponding to the current Argument Graph in the normative model.","After propagation, the Analyzer returns the following measures for an argument: its normative strength, which is its effect on the belief in the goal proposition in the normative model, and its effectiveness, which is its effect on the user's belief in the goal proposition (estimated according to the user model). Of course, an argument's effectiveness may be quite different from its normative strength. When anticipating an argument's effect upon a user, NAG takes into account three cognitive errors that humans frequently succumb to: belief bias, overconfidence and the base rate fallacy [Korb et aL, 1997].","If the normative strength or effectiveness of the Argument Graph is insufficient, another cycle of the Generation-Analysis algorithm is executed, gathering further support for propositions which have a path to the goal or have a high activation level (Step 3 of the Generation-Analysis algorithm). In this manner, NAG combines goal-based content planning with the associative inspection of highly active nodes. After integrating the new sub-arguments into the Argument Graph (Step 4), the now enlarged Argument Graph is again sent to the Analyzer (Step 5). Hence, by completing additional focusing-generation-analysis cycles, Argument Graphs that are initially unsatisfactory are often improved. Example - Continued The argument that can be built at this stage consists of nodes NT, N10-N13 and N15-N17. However, only N13 is admissible among the potential premise nodes. Thus, the anticipated belief in the goal node in both the normative and the user model falls short of the desired ranges. This is reported by the Analyzer to the Strategist. Nodes NT, Nlo-N12, N16 and N17 are now added to the context (which initially included N6, 153 N13 and N15), and the next cycle of the Generation-Analysis algorithm starts. This process continues until the Analyzer reports that the belief in the goa ! proposition is inside the target ranges in both the user and the normative model. In this example, this happens after two additional generation-analysis cycles, which activate nodes N1, N4 and N14 among others (in dashed boxes in Figure 4(a))."]},{"title":"7 Argument Presentation","paragraphs":["After a successful Argument Graph has been built, the argument must be structured for presentation to the user.

As each proposition is \"mentioned\", activation spreads from it in a pattern which depends on the level of activation of its neighbours and the strength of its association with its neighbours (Section 4). 2 For instance, when a highly connected node is activated, it in turn activates a large number of nodes, but the activation spread to each node is relatively small, leading to a quick decay in the activation process. This process forms a small but densely populated \"bubble of attention\" around the activated node [Taylor, 1998]. In contrast, when a node with a few connections is activated, the activation spread to each neighbouring node is stronger, hence the process takes longer to decay, yielding a larger but more sparsely populated bubble of attention. Such larger bubbles normally encompass several reasoning steps in the Argument Graph, thereby enabling NAG to remove intermediate conclusions (Section 7.3)."]},{"title":"7.3 Pruning the Argument Graph","paragraphs":["The Presenter interleaves probabilistic pruning with semantic suppression. It starts with probabilistic pruning, which iteratively removes from the Argument Graph premises that have a relatively small contribution to the belief in their consequents, and also removes entire lines of reasoning which provide more support for the goal than what is Strictly necessary in order to achieve a belief within the target ranges. After each removal, the Analyzer is called to check whether the belief in the goal proposition is still within the target ranges. In addition, affected subgraphs in the Argument Graph are reordered according to the policies mentioned in Section 7.2 (reordering is necessary if their relative sizes have changed as a result of the removal of","2Nothing is actually mentioned at this stage.

Probabilistic pruning fails when the Analyzer reports that the anticipated belief in the goal is outside a target range or when the level of activation of a proposition falls below a certain threshold. In this case, the last removed proposition is reinstated, and semantic suppression is activated. This process iteratively omits from the Argument Graph intermediate conclusions whose level of activation was already high before they were \"mentioned\", so long as the probabilities of the links from their antecedent to their consequent are sufficiently strong. The rationale for this omission is that propositions which are readily inferred, because they have a high level of activation and the user attributes them a very high probability on the basis of a simple inference from just mentioned premises, will continue to contribute much of their support to the conclusions that follow them. For instance, if the bubble of attention around node E in the Argument Graph in Figure 5(b) includes nodes F and G, then node F may be omitted, yielding an argument such as \"A, B and C cause D. E leads to G, which together with D causes H\". Semantic pruning fails when the level of activation of any required subsequent proposition falls below a threshold. In this case, the last removed proposition is reinstated, probabilistic pruning is reactivated, and the interleaved pruning continues. These pruning processes continue until time runs out Or until both pruning methods have failed several consecutive times. 3 Example - Continued After traversing the Argument Graph according to the premise-to-goal strategy, pruning is performed. Probabilistic pruning removes node N9 in Figure 4(a) as its probability is very low, and hence so is its effect on its consequent N6. The branch containing nodes Nlo and NI4 is removed despite the high probability of these nodes, because after their omission the probability of the goal proposition is still withinthe target ranges. The branch containing Ns and N6 is removed for the same reason (without removing node N6, since it is still connected to other nodes in the Argument Graph). Probabilistic pruning fails after this step, so semantic suppression is attempted, which removes nodes N2 ~ N3 and N12. Both types of pruning fail after this step, yielding the Argument Graph in Figure 4(b). The expanded tree which represents the final ordering of this Argument Graph appears in Figure 5(c). The post-order traversal of this tree yields an argument which may be roughly paraphrased as follows.","Dinosaurs became extinct about 65 million years ago. This could have been caused in part by most","plant species dying. This could also have been caused in part by reptiles having trouble breeding.","This and mostplant species dying was likely caused by the Earth becoming much cooler, which could","have been caused by material obscuringthe Sun.","Many 65 million-year-old iridium deposits (which were found) and material obscuring the Sun could","have been caused by an explosion throwing debris into the atmosphere.","A giant crater which was discovered in the Gulf of Mexico was likely caused by an asteroid strike","forming a giant crater.
