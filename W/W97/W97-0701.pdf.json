They may be enhanced by modern display resources They are apphcable to individual source texts or to data sets as wholes Most importantly, we can tackle tins level of summarising because current robust parsing technology may succeed, given source redundancy, m getting enough of value from sources to help users, and because current text production methods can deliver usable summary texts We should push this line hard, seehng to rmmrarse appheatlon-spec~c domain knowledge, to take advantage of discourse structure, and to address summary function for the user"]}]}
