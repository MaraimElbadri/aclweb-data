We propose a set of rules for the assignment of prosodic properties which take an explicit discourse model into account. In contrast to Text-to-Speech systems (and more generally, systems which require linguistic analysis of the input), explicit discourse models can be reliably constructed in Data-to-Speech systems (and more generally, in systems which generate natural language from data), so that a more natural prosody can be achieved.","The rules for prosody assignment described in this paper are used in the language generation compon-","*Authors Theune and Klabbers carried out this research within the framework of the Priority Programme Language and Speech Technology (TST).

The method for natural language generation implemented in D2S is hybrid in nature (Reiter, 1995); (Coch, 1996). It is a particular mixture of (syntactic) template-based techniques and full natural language generation, described in more detail in Klabbers et al. (1997a). A variety of Data-to-Speech systems have been and are be-ing developed on the basis of D2S. Examples are the Dial Your Disc (DYD)-system, which presents information in English about Mozart compositions (Deemter et al., 1994); (Collier and Landsbergen, 1995), and the GoalGetter system, which presents spoken monologues in Dutch about the course and the result of a football game (Klabbers et al., 1997b). In this paper, we illustrate the prosodic rules used in D2S with examples from GoalGetter.","After a brief description and illustration of the general architecture of D2S, we describe in detail how the prosodic component of D2S computes the prosodic properties of the generated sentences. Then we discuss how the resulting prosodic annotations are used in the various speech output techniques employed in D2S. We end with some remarks about evaluation of the prosodic rules and a conclusion."]},{"title":"2 Architecture of D2S","paragraphs":["The general architecture of D2S is represented in Figure 1.

First we will discuss the accentuation algorithm, which is based on a version of Focus-Accent Theory proposed in (Dirksen, 1992) and (Dirksen and Quen~, 1993). In Focus-Accent Theory, binary branching metrical trees are used to represent the relative prominence of nodes with respect to pitch accent.","We will use our previous example sentence, Dertien minuten later liet de aanvaller zijn tweede doelpunt aantekenen, as an illustration. First, the accentuation algorithm constructs the sentence's metrical tree, shown in Figure 5 (simplified). In our implementation, this tree corresponds to the sentence's syntactic tree, 1 except that its nodes have focus markers and are labeled weak or strong. The focus properties of the nodes in the metrical tree are determined as follows.","Initially, all maximal projections (NP, VP etc.) are assigned a positive focus value, indicated as [+F]. The other nodes are not specified for focus. These initial focus values can be changed by non-syntactic factors causing the focus value to become negative, indicated as I-F]. This happens in three cases: (1) a node dominates an unaccentable word; (2) a node represents given information? (3) a node dominates only nodes which are marked [-F]. Unaccentable","1 Unary branching of metrical trees is allowed.","2This is based on the observation by Halliday (1967), Chafe (Chafe, 1976), Brown (Brown, 1983) and others that phrases expressing 'new' information are normally accented, while phrases expressing ~given' or 'old' in-fbrmation are usually deaccented. words, e.g., certain function words, are explicitly listed. Our example sentence contains only one such word, the determiner de ('the'). The rules for determining givenness are based on the theory proposed by van Deemter (1994), who distinguishes two kinds of givenness: object-givenness and concept-givenness.","A phrase is regarded as object-given if it refers to a discourse entity that has been referred to earlier in its local discourse domain, which in the present implementation consists of all preceding sentences in the same paragraph. In the example, checking the Discourse Model reveals that the phrases de aanvaUer ('the forward') and zijn ('his') are object-given, because their referent (Kluivert) was referred to in the preceding sentence, which belongs to the same paragraph. This means that their dominating nodes in the metrical tree must be marked I-F]. This example illustrates that object-givenness does not depend on the surface form of the referring expression, but only on its referent. The expressions de aanvaller and zijn are object-given even though they were not used earlier in the text.","The second kind of givenness, concept-givenness, occurs if the root of a word is synonymous (includ-ing identity) with the root of a preceding word in the local discourse domain, or if the concept expressed by the second word subsumes the concept expressed by the first word. Our example sentence contains two instances of the first case: the words rainuten and doelpunt are concept-given, and therefore marked I-F], due to the presence in the preced-41","CP [+F] s","AP C' [+F] w s"]},{"title":"\"dertien C~ minuten \"later","paragraphs":["IP w [+F] s"]},{"title":"40","paragraphs":["NP VP W liet [-F] w [+F l s"]},{"title":"de aanvaller","paragraphs":["NP V Â° [+F] s w"]},{"title":"aantekenen","paragraphs":["DP N' I-F] w s"]},{"title":"zijn","paragraphs":["AP N' [+F l s I-F] w"]},{"title":"\"tweede [","paragraphs":["N O I-F] w"]},{"title":"doelpunt","paragraphs":["Figure 5: Metrical tree for the fourth sentence. ing sentence of the synonymous words"]},{"title":"minuten","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"treffer","paragraphs":["respectively.

The second case of concept:givenness, subsumption, will be very difficult to detect in an unrestricted Text-to-Speech system because it requires the presence of a concept hierarchy, which is only feasible if the relevant concepts are known in advance. Finally, determining object-givenness will also be very difficult in Text-to-Speech, because it makes very high demands on text analysis.","Aider the metrical tree nodes have been assigned focus markings, their weak/strong labelling can be determined.

Three phrase boundary strengths are distinguished. 4 The sentence-final boundary (///) is the strongest one. Words which are clause final (i.e., the last word in a CP or IP) or which precede a punctuation symbol other than a comma (e.g., ';') are followed by a mQor boundary (-//). Minor boundaries (/) are assigned to other words preceding a comma. Additionally, constituents to the left of an I', a C' or a maximal projection are followed by a weak boundary, provided that both constituents are accessible for accent, and that the left one has sufficient length (more than four syllables). This is a slightly modified version of a structural condition proposed by Dirksen and Quen@ (1993). In our example only the AP dertien minuten later meets this condition and is therefore followed by a minor phrase boundary. Since the sentence contains no punctuation and consists of just one clause, the only other phrase boundary is the sentence-final one. 4 Speech Generation The SGM has two output modes, phrase concatenation and phonetics-to-speech, each of which makes optimal use of the prosodic markers generated by the LGM. We start with a brief description of the two output modes, followed by a discussion of the prosodic realization in either output mode.","Phrase concatenation - Phrase concatenation is a technique which tries to reconcile the highfidelity quality and inherent naturalness of prerecorded speech with the flexibility of synthetic speech. Entire phrases and words are recorded, and played back in different orders to form complete utterances. In this way a large number of utterances can be pronounced on the basis of a limited number of prerecor- (led phrases, saving memory space and increasing flexibility. This technique is best applied to a carrier-and slot situation where there is a limited number of types of utterances (carriers) with variable information to be inserted in fixed positions (slots). The systems based on D2S fit this situation well. The carriers correspond to the syntactic templates and these have slots for variable information such as match results, player names, etc.","Successful application of the phrase concatenation technique is not quite as trivial as it may seem at first sight. If all the phrases are recorded in isola-tion without taking their accentuation or their po-","41n longer texts, containing more complicated constructions, it might be desirable to distinguish more levels. Sanderman (1996) proposes a boundary depth of five to achieve more natural phrasing. sition in the sentence into account, the resulting speech will have discontinuities in duration, loudness and intonation. Our method is more sophisticated in that different prosodic variants for otherwise identical phrases have been recorded. To determine how many and what prosodic realizations should be recorded for each phrase, a thorough analysis of the material the system can generate is required.","Phonetics-to-Speech - Synthetic speech is far more flexible than any form of prerecorded speech. Since there is complete control over the realization it is very well suited to test the accentuation and phrasing rules. In commercial applications synthetic speech is not used very often since the naturalness of the output speech still leaves a great deal to be desired.","Because the LGM provides all relevant information there is no need for full-fledged text-to-speech synthesis. The LGM generates an orthographic representation which has a unique mapping to a phonetic representation. 5 This makes it possible to do errorless grapheme-to-phoneme conversion by look-ing up the words in a lexicon instead of using rules. Our phonetics-to-speech system, SPENGI (SPeech synthesis ENGIne) uses diphone concatenation in either LPC or PSOLA format. The rule formalism for intonation is an implementation based on the intonation theory of 't Hart et al. (1990).","Realizing prosody in speech generation - The enriched text that the LGM generates contains several prosodic markers. In the phrase concatenation component these markers trigger the choice of the appropriate prosodic variant from the phrase database and the pauses to be inserted at the appropriate positions.","The carrier sentences have been recorded in just one prosodic version. The variable words that fill the slots have been recorded in six different prosodic variants to account for the place in the sentence where they occur and the accentuation they receive. A word can be either accented or deaccented. We did not instruct our speaker as to how to realize the accents in the carrier sentences. In the variables we just made sure that accents were realized consistently in each category. When a word occurs before a minor phrase boundary the word is realized with a continuation rise. A major phrase boundary triggers a pause and possibly a lengthening of the word preceding the boundary. Before a final phrase boundary, the word is realized with a final fall. Inserting the right words in the right contexts optimizes the prosody of the output speech, thus achieving fluency","5It could also generate a phonetic representation directly. 43"]},{"title":"_A A_/","paragraphs":["de \"wedstrijd tussen \"psv en \"ajax / \"eindigde in \"@een 11 \"@drie 1/1 Figure 6: Stylized pitch contour of the introductory sentence and a natural rendering.","In Dutch, the score of a match is pronounced in a special way: the major boundary between the two numbers triggers lengthening of the first number and a pause between the two numbers, but the two accented numbers are realized with a so-called 'flat hat' pattern as if they were part of the same clause (see 't Hart (1990) for a description of pitch movements). This is indicated by a special marker used only in the phrase concatenation component of GoalGetter (the @_-sign). There is another special marker (the 70-sign) to mark nouns functioning as an adjunct to another noun. The special nouns are always accented and shorter in duration than when they occur as a head noun. Figure 6 shows a stylized pitch contour of the opening sentence of Figure 3, which illustrates how the score is pronounced.","In the phonetics-to-speech component the prosodic markers are used to trigger the intonation and duration rules. Intonation is represented as a series of pitch movements with restrictions on the possible combinations of movements. The words that are accented are given a prominence-lending pitch pattern (a pointed hat or a flat hat are most commonly used). At the boundaries a pause of some length can occur, where the length of the pause depends on the strength of the boundary. A boundary can also trigger a continuation rise or pre-boundary lengthening, as mentioned above. To allow for variation in the intonation, each rule has a number of weighted alternatives from which a random choice is made (taking the weights into account). This also makes it possible to have some optional rules, for instance, for the melodic highlighting of syntactic boundaries which is not obligatory. 5 Evaluation Nachtegaal (1997) reports on a small experiment which was carried out to test the accentuation algorithm of D2S. No formal evaluation has taken place for the algorithm determining the placement of phrase boundaries.","hL the experiment by Nachtegaal (1997), Dutch speakers were asked to read aloud texts generated by the LGM of GoalGetter. Recordings of the read texts were presented to 'expert listeners' who indicated on which words they heard an accent. Comparisons were then made between the accentuation patterns produced by the speakers and those generated by the system. The results of the experiment were positive: the number of words on which the accentuation by the speakers deviated from the accentuation by GoalGetter was very small (less than 470 of all accentable words, i.e., excluding 'unaccentables' like function words etc.). The texts used in the experiment contained sentences which were structurally similar to those of the example text given in Figure 3. Not all syntactic constructions which are currently generated by GoalGetter were included in the test. The prosody of the current version of Goal Getter was only evaluated informally, but the results were in line with those of Nachtegaal (1997).","The prosodic rules described in this paper have also been succesfully implemented in the DYD-system (I:LEF), which differs from GoalGetter with respect to language (English versus Dutch) and domain (Mozart compositions versus football reports). Informal evaluation of the prosody in DYD gave equally satisfactory results as for GoalGetter. This was as expected, since the prosodic rules of D2S are essentially domain- and language independent. 6 All things considered, the quality of the prosodic rules of D2S is judged to be good. 6 Conclusion To determine the prosodic properties of a sentence in a text, information about both sentence-internal and sentence-external syntax and semantics is needed. In Text-to-Speech this information has to be obtained through text analysis, whereas in Data-to-Speech reliable information of this kind is readily available. As a consequence, Data-to-Speech provides a better basis for using sophisticated prosody assignment rules than Text-to-Speech.","The prosodic rules discussed in this paper are implemented in a generic Data-to-Speech system","6Only the rule governing the weald/strong labelling of the metrical tree nodes has a language-specific parameter. 44 called D2S. They make crucial use of both sentence-internal and sentence-external semantic and syntactic information, provided by the system in the form of a Discourse Model and parse trees of the generated sentences. The reliable and detailed character of this information makes it possible to assign prosodic markings which are reliable and detailed as well. This in turn allows for a close control of pros-- odic realization, resulting in natural-sounding intonation. Rei~rences","Brown, G. 1983. Prosodic structure and the given/new distinction. In D. R.
