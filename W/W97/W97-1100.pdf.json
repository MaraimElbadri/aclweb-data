It contains the papers prepared for the Third Meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group in Computational Phonology, held on E 12th July, 1997, at the Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia, Madrid, Spain. As this meeting is taking place in conjunction with the 8th Conference of the European Chapter of the ACL, papers on work relating to languages of Europe were specifically welcomed. Work on Dutch dialects, British English, and Czech is reported here, as well as several other languages presenting interesting challenges to computational~phonological modelling. The purpose of SIGPHON is to provide a forum for the interchange of research results, and this third meeting establishes the workshops as the principal mechanism for achieving that aim. In particular, its goals are to maintain computational phonology firmly on the research agenda in computational linguistics, to nurture links between researchers in computational phonology, and to facilitate the dissemination of research results and software. SIGPHON provides an FTP server and World-Wide Web site for papers, implementations, back-issues of the newsletter, and a membership directory which lists the research interests of more than 100 people working in the field. The URL of the FTP server is:"]},{"title":"ftp://ftp.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/pub/phonology","paragraphs":["and the SIGPHON home page may be found at"]},{"title":"http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/phonology/CompPhon.html","paragraphs":["All who work in computational phonology, or who have interests that touch on it, are welcome to browse our home page: and, if they wish, to add their name and interests in the directory. This third meerng of SIGPHON, like the first, has no special theme. The papers show a broad range of research activity, though they fall naturally into four groups: dialect distance metrics (Raman et al., Nerbonne and Heeringa), prediction of vowel systems from first principles (de Boer; Carr4 and Mody), lexical studies of specific languages (Bird, Skoumalova), and grammatical formalisms for computational phonology (Coleman and Pierrehumbert, Kiraz). As program chair I wish to thank my fellow program committee members for the efforts in reviewing the submitted papers within a very tight time-schedule at a time when they were all pressed by many other duties: Bob Berwick (MIT), Andras Komai (BBN), and Steven Bird (University of Edinburgh). I am particularly grateful to Steven for advice on the practical arrangements of the workshop, at a time when he was approaching the end of a long period of field work in Cameroon. I am also grateful to two anonymous reviewers, who gave external reviews of two papers submitted by members of the program committee. Finally, I wish to thank Richard Sproat for providing me with various pieces of useful information learned from organising the previous workshop.
