Introduction","paragraphs":["In this paper, we present a description of the typology of nominal phrases containing Proper Names (IN) and the local grammars [GrogT],[Moh94] constructed on the basis of this description. The goal is to implement a system which detects automatically PNs in a given text, allowing the construction of an electronic lexicon of PNs.","The definition of Proper Nouns, as opposed to that of Common Nouns, is often a problematic issue in linguistic descriptions [Gar91]. PNs are understood in general as phonic sequences associated with one referent, without any intrinsic meanings, such as Socrates, Bach or Paris. They usually are characterized by nominal determination, the upper case marker, prohibition of pluralizing procedure, or non-translativity [Wi191]. However, semantic or syntactic criteria do not allow to distinguish these two categories in an operational way. For example, nouns such as sun, earth or moon, semantically appropriate to the definition of proper nouns such as Mars or Jupiter, do not have to be written with the upper case initial: hence, they are not considered as proper nouns. On the contrary, some proper nouns such as Baudelaire or Napoleon can be used as well as common nouns in contexts where they occur in metonymic or metaphorical relations with common nouns like: I read some (Baudelaire + poems of Baudelaire) He is a real (Napoleon + general) Moreover, they often allow, like common nouns, the derivation of adjectives: e.g. Socratic, Napoleonic or Parisian. These are also written with initial upper case, differently from usual adjectives.","The situation concerning French is similar to that. Let us consider [Gar91]: 273 J'ai dcoutd (du Bach + ,~e la musique) J' ai bu (du Champagne + du vin rouge) Derivational productivity is also underlined: socratique, parisien or newyorkais, which however do not begin in the upper case.","In the case of Engli,;h or French, one could delimit formally the category proper nouns by means of the upper case, even though this criterion does not correspond entirely to our intuition about proper nouns. However, in Korean, there are no typographical markers such as upper case vs. lower case, while one assumes that the nouns such as in (1) could be semantically and syntactically different from those of(2):","(1) ~ ~--$-, z-l~. _=~ Kim Minu, Seoul, France","(2) ~}, -~:, q-~ namja[rnan], sudo[capital], nala[country] This situation makes more difficult the distinction between proper nouns and common nouns than in the case of French or English, when the former appears in the same grammatical positions as the latter like: (I listened to (Masart + classic misic) all day) -,-~ (~_~2~ + ~. ~y_~).~ ~ (He only drinks (Bordeaux + red wine)) The derivation of some other categories from PNs is also observed: ~;~ ~ - ~ [in Park JungHee's manner] ~z~.. =~- [France style] ~-. ~-o~ [Chinese (language)] In fact, the distinction between these two categories might be arbitrary. We should perhaps consider a continuum of the noun system: a thesaurus of nouns constituted of the most generic nouns to the most specific nouns (which we call proper nouns). The following example shows a part of a noun hierarchy (Figure 1):","All Physical~ ~ Abstract","Animate Non-Animate","\",,ffi","Person Animal (not-human) \".ffi","Korean American ...","a / Kim MinU Park JungHee ... Figure 1 Therefore, in the automatic analyses of texts written in Korean, we intend to consider the definition problem of proper nouns from a different view point: whatever the given definition of proper nouns is, once a complete list of them is available, we presumably do not need any longer this particular distinction between proper and common nouns. All nouns have some semantic and syntactic properties, which lead to group them into several classes, not by binary distinctions. Nevertherless, it seems still hard to establish an exhaustive list of what we call proper nouns. Actually, proper nouns, important in number and in frequency, are one of the most problematic units for all automatic analyzers of natural language texts. 274","In this study, we will focus on the problems of recognition of proper names. We do not try to characterize them as an axiomatic class, but attach to them a formal definition to determine explicitly the object of our study. Here is our formal criterion: {X e (Interrogative Pron -~? [Who?]) [ X e (DECOS-NS) }"]},{"title":"Hu[x~~raon nouns [DECOS-NS]","paragraphs":["That is, proper names are determined by the fact that they do not exist in our lexicon of Korean common nouns (DECOS-NS/V01) [Nam94], and by their correspondence with the interrogative pronoun '-~5 z"]},{"title":"nugu?","paragraphs":["[who?]'. The nouns considered as proper names according to these conditions do not always correspond to our semantic intuition. Nevertheless, they usually do not have intrinsic meanings; and they do not have explicitly distinct referents. Given that a lexicon of Korean common nouns (DECOS-NS) has already been built ['Nam94], the ambiguity across the category of common nouns and that of proper ones will be settled only in one of these two lexicons by looking up DECOS-NS: if they already are included in this lexicon, we do not consider them in the lexicon of proper nouns, without questioning their linguistic status. Remember that our goal is not to discuss the nature of this noun class, but to complete the lexicon of Korean Nouns in NLP systems. In order to handle them in an NLP system, given that we do not have yet a dictionary which provides all proper nouns, auxiliary methods are required, such as syntactic information or local grammars that allow to analyze them.","In the following sections, we will classify in five types the contexts where Proper Names can appear, and describe their characteristics in detail."]},{"title":"2.

Consider: Jacques Chirac e.st le President de la France Bill Clinton is the President of USA Nevertheless, the upper case does not totally satisfy our semantic intuition, since we also observe nouns with the upper case, such as President or President, which certainly do not designate one particular person (here, we encounter the fundamental problem of the definition of the term 'proper'). Likewise, in the following sentence, the noun Franqais and American started with the upper case cannot be considered as proper names, whatever the definition of proper name is: (Cet homme + Un Franqais) e.st le Prdsident de la France (This man + An American) is the President of USA 2.2. Type H < PN (Spec+E) Professional Title-(Postposition+E) >","This type of sequence is characterized by the presence of nouns of professional title (PT), such as-Wx~ bagsa [Doctor] ~-~ gyosu [Professor] ~ wenjang [Director] ~0~ sajang [President] ~r rd janggwan [Minister] For example: Kim MinU bagsa-neun migug-eise 5nyengan gongbuha-essda PN<Kim MinU> Doctor-Postp U.S.A.-Postp 5 year-during study-Past (Dr. Kirn MinU has studied in U.S.A. during 5 years) The noun phrase in subject position: 'K/m MinU bagsaneun\" is composed of three strings. However, in Korean, typographical constraint is not a reliable criterion, since we cannot prohibit writing this phrase in other ways like: (2a) ~% ~,]--~ (2b) ~] ~ ~,~ KimMinU_ bagsaneun KimMinUbagsaneun When proper names occur as attached to other elements of noun phrases, their analysis becomes more complicated. Therefore, a local grammar recognizing PTs such as (Figure 3): Figure 3. Local grammar of Type II 276 will reduce numerous mismatchings between the strings like (2b) and the combination of the items found in a dictionary.","Since a family name alone can precede PTs, the grammar above should be refined (Figure 4): Figure 4. A more detailed Local grammar of Type II Thus we observe (3) instead of(l): (3) ~ ~ =1~,~t 5~ o=~r~ Kim bagsa-neun migug-eise 5 nyengan gongbuha-essda (Dr. Kim has studied in the U.S.A. during 5 years) while a given name alone hardly appears with PTs: .~.~-?- ~'~,~--b ~1~1~t 5~Z~ ~ ??MinU bagsa-neun migug-eise 5 nyengan gongbuha-essda (Dr. Min U has studied in U.S.A. during 5 years) When we list the nouns of professional title, the number of PNs recognized by the local grammar presented in Figure 4 will be increased. Nevertheless, listing these nouns up does not guarantee automatically to recognize PArs, since we can come across specific nouns (Spec) inside of these sequences: (4) ,~ ~-- mu'~\" u_.~,~]._~. =1~011~ 5~z~ o~-V~Ir~ Kim MinU bebhag bagsa-neun migug-eise 5nyengan gongbuha-essda (Dr. of Laws Kim MinU has studied in U.S.A. during 5 years) The Specs are appropriate to PTs: we observe nouns designating scientific domains such as 'physics', \"biology', \"mathematics', or 'literature' for the PTs like 'doctor', whereas we find another set of Specs for the PT'minister': ' education', 'culture ', or 'Wansfortation' for example.","Notice that PTs can also appear without PNs: (bebhag + E) bagsa-ga jeil senmangbad-neun sahoijeg fiwijung-eui hana-i-da (A doctor (of Law + E) is one of the most envied social titles) -' (~'+E) ~1--~ ~'~ ~-~'-~ ~t~ geu ('bebhag + E)bagsa-neun iljfig hangug-eul ddena-ssda (This doctor (of Law + E) left Korea early) Thus, in order to analyze the strin~ followed by a PT in contexts such as (5), the system should first look up a lexicon of Common Nouns (and eventually a lexicon of Determiners), and if the search fails, one could suppose that we found a proper name: (Sa)ol~ ~,1-71- ~71~ -~r~ igonggyei bagsa-ga ingi-ga nop-da (Doctors of Natural Science are highly requested) (Sb)o I ~ ~x~7~ ~71~ ~ i gonghag bagsa-ga ingi-ga nop-da (This doctor of Science is highly requested) 277 (Sc)ol ~ ~'l'~ ~ 21 21- ~r4iminu bagsa-ga ingi-ga nop-da (Doctor Lee MinU is highly requested) In (Sa), the string found with 'bagsa [doctor]' is a simple noun 'igonggyei [natural science]'; the sequence that precedes 'bagsa [doctor]' in (5b) is a phrase composed of a determiner 'i [this]' and a common noun 'gonghag [science]'; the element followed by \"bagsa [doctor]' in (5c) will not be matched with any entries of the lexicon of common nouns: only this string will then be recognized as a proper name.","The local grammar proposed so far should be completed by the description of the following transformation. Let us compare (4) with (6): bebhag bagsa Kim MinU-neun migug-eise 5 nyengan gongbuha-essda (Kim MinU, Dr. of Laws, has studied in U.S.A during 5 years) The sentence (6) can still be transformed into:","~ ~l~oll,~-I ~ ~ ~ ~,q-olr--lKim MinU-neun migug-eise 5 nyengan gongbuha-n bebhag bagsa-ida (Kim MinU is a doctor of Laws who has studied in U.S.A. during 5 years) In fact, the sequence containing PTs corresponds to a simple sentence: PN W-Professional Title W-Professional Title PN S: PN be a W-Professional Title (7a) ~ ~q- ~ ~x~ (Tb)ffi ~ed ~x~ ~ ~- (7¢)= z~ ~-~ ~ ~1-x].olr_. t.

If we want to recognize automatically PNs in a given text in order to construct an electronic lexicon of PNs, Recall, that is the ratio of PNs retrieved for a given grammar over the number of PNs in the text, should certainly be higher than Precision.","I Let consider results of In the contexts of i.e. <PN us some experimental our study. Type V, Incomplete Noun-(Postposition + E)>, the Incomplete Noun (/N) '~] ssi [Mr./Miss./Mrs.]' can appear with a family name alone, a given name alone, or a full name (of. 2.5. Figure 7). Remember","I that, in Korean, a typographical unit delimited by blanks cannot directly be taken as a basic element for morphological analysis [Nam97]: we should then analyze the strings occurring with a blank on the leit side of/Ns as well as the strings stuck to 1Ns in order to examine the context Type V. Thus,","I the local grammar of Type V for '~q ssr is the following graph (Figure 13):"]},{"title":"!","paragraphs":["Figure 13"]},{"title":"II II 285","paragraphs":["Our first text was composed of 29373 characters [Cho96], we located 22 sequences containing ssi, 20 of which are PNs (Figure 14): Figure 14 In the second text, composed of 30869 characters, 69 occmrences of \"X-ssi\" are observed. All \"Full name-ssi\" sequences here appear attached, whereas, in the preceding text, they all appear with a blank (i.e. 7(-#-ssi'). Here is the result (Figure 15):",":.Name -ssi G.Name -ssi Full Name - ssi nonPN Tota 35 I 1 t 24 ' 9 i 69 '","Figure 15 The 9 sequences 'non-PNs\" are as followings: [1 ] ~ ~q 7] eg-ssi-gi [6] o]-7].~], aga-ssi, [2] Â°~]---~--a\" ib-ssi-leumeul [7] :z]]~]y~ jei-ssi-doineun [3] o]-7}~ ~ aga-ssi-lan [8] ~ ~ ~ nal-ssi-yessda [4] o].y].~]~ aga-ssi-du [9] ~Y~ nal-ssi-ga [5] o].y~ ~ aga-ssi-la Looking up our dictionaries of Korean Simple Nouns (DECOS-NSN01) [Nam94], and of Korean Postpositions (DECOS-POST/V01) [Nam96b] eliminate [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [8], [9], which are the sequences composed of a common noun and a postposition (or a typographical separator such as a comma). Because [1] is a dialectal adverb, and [7] a 'Noun-Verb' string, they were not detected in our system.","The third text composed of 33982 characters contains 10 occurrences of ~'-ssi\" one of which is a nonPN ('.~-01 peulo ssi-leumi [N/N/Postp]') (Figure 16): Figure 16 This nonPNwas eliminated after looking up the dictionary of Postpositions: there is no postposition '~o] leumi'. The analysis of the text above on the basis of the local grammar presented in Figure 3 (Type II <PN Spec-PT-(Posq~ + E)> ) in 2.2. allows to recognize PNs in a more satisfactory way. Besides ~-ssi\" strings, with two PTs: '~-~-~ daitonglyeng [the President]' and '~ susa~g [the prime minister]', we could recognize 73 % of PNs, that is, 49 occurrences of 67 (i.e. Recall is 0.73). However, use of the local grammars of Figure 13 and Figure 3 (only with these two PTs above) leaves some nonPNs: Precision is 0.7 (49 strings of 70 which occurred with these/N and PTs are PNs). Since our goal is to recognize most contexts where PNs can occur, in order to consn'uct a lexicon of FNs as complete as possible, Recall should be more important than Precision in our system. By adding a few more PTs (cf. Type II) such as '~--~ janggun [general]', '~ sensu [player]', FRs (cf. Type III) such as '~l.~ bunye [father-daughter]', or/Ns (cf. Type V) such as 'Â°o z yang [Miss.]' in the lexicon on the basis of which our local grammars are constructed, we could obtain a more reliable result as shown in the following table (Figure 17): i 89 ' 59 Figure 17 286"]},{"title":"l I I i I I I i I I I i I i i I i I I l I I, I I i I","paragraphs":["\" i ,-,) .,"]},{"title":"I I I I I I I I I, I I I","paragraphs":["Thus, Recall increases: 0.88, whereas Precision goes down: 0.66. The 8 PNs that are not retrieved by our local grammars are given below.
