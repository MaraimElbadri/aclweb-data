The statistics-based computation of word similarity has been popular in recent research, but is associated with a significant computational cost. On the other hand, the use of hand-crafted thesauri as semantic resources is simple to implement, but lacks mathematical rigor. To integrate the advantages of these two approaches, we aim at calculating a statistical weight for each branch of a thesaurus, so that we can measure word similarity simply based on the length of the path between two words in the thesaurus. Our experiment on Japanese nouns shows that this framework upheld the inequality of statistics-based word similarity with an accuracy of more than 70%. We also report on the effectivity of our framework in the task of word sense disambiguation. 1 Introduction This paper proposes a new approach for word similarity measurement, as has been variously used in such NLP applications as smoothing [Dagan et al., 1994; Grishman and Sterling, 1994] and word clustering [Charniak, 1993; Hindle, 1990; Pereira et"]},{"title":"al.,","paragraphs":["1993; Tokunaga et"]},{"title":"al.,","paragraphs":["1995].","Previous methods for word similarity measurement can be divided into two categories: statistics-based approaches and hand-crafted thesaurus-based approaches. In statistics-based approaches, and namely the \"vector space model\", each word is generally represented by a vector consisting of co-occurrence statistics (such as frequency) with respect to other words [Charniak, 1993]. The similarity between two given words is then computationally measured using two vectors representing those words. One typical implementation computes the relative similarity as the cosine of the angle between two vectors, a method which is also commonly used in information retrieval and text categorization systems to measure the similarity between documents [Frankes and Baeza-Yates, 1992]. Since it is based on mathematical methods, this type of similarity measurement has been popular. Besides this, since the similarity is computed based on given co-occurrence data, word similarity can easily be adjusted according to the domain. However, data sparseness is an inherent problem. This fact was observed in our preliminary experiment, despite using statistical information taken from news articles as many as 4 years. Furthermore, in this approach, vectors require O(N 2) memory space, given that N is the number of words, and therefore, large data sizes can prove prohibitive. Note that even if one statically stores possible word similarity combinations, O(N 2) space is required.","The other category of word similarity approaches uses semantic resources, that is, hand-cra/ted thesauri (such as the Roget's thesaurus [Chapman, 1984] or Word-Net [Miller et al., 1993] in the case of English, and"]},{"title":"Bunruigoihyo","paragraphs":["[National Language Research Institute, 1996] or EDR [EDR, 1995] in the case of Japanese), based on the intuitively feasible assumption that words located near each other within the structure of a thesaurus have similar meaning. Therefore, the similarity between two given words is represented by the length of the path between them in the thesaurus structure [Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994; Li et"]},{"title":"al.,","paragraphs":["1995; Uramoto, 1994]. Unlike the former approach, the required memory space can be restricted to"]},{"title":"O(N)","paragraphs":["because only a list of semantic codes for each word is required.

Formalizing equations for other pairs of words in the same manner, we can derive the simultaneous equation shown in figure 2. That is, we can assign the SBL for each branch by way of finding answers for each x~. This method is expected to excel in the following aspects.","First, this method allows us to measure the statistics-based word similarity, while retaining the optimal required memory space"]},{"title":"(O(N)).","paragraphs":["One may argue that statistics-based automatic thesaurus construction (for example, the method proposed by Tokunaga et al. [Tokunaga et"]},{"title":"al.,","paragraphs":["1995]) can provide the same advantage, besides which there is no human overhead. However, it has been empirically observed that the topology of the structure (especially at higher levels) is not necessarily reasonable when based solely on statistics [Frankes and Baeza-Yates, 1992]. To avoid this problem, we would like to introduce hand-crafted thesauri into our framework because the topology (such as MAMMAL is a hyper class of HUMAN) allows for higher levels of sophistica-tion based on human knowledge.","Second, since each SBL reflects the statistics taken from co-occurrence data ~f the"]},{"title":"whole","paragraphs":["word set, statistics of each word can complement each other, and thus, the data sparseness problem tends to be minimized.
