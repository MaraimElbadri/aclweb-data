It makes use of an unsupervised learning procedure to collect training and test data, and the back-off model to make assignment decisions. 1 Introduction Assigning a parse structure to the German sentence (1) involves addressing the fact that it is syntactically ambiguous:","(1) Eine hohe Inflationsrate erwartet die ()konomin. a high inflation rate expects the economist 'The economist expects a high inflation rate.' In this sentence it must be determined which nominal phrase is the subject of the verb. The verb er-warren ('to expect') takes, in one reading, a nominative NP as its subject and an accusative NP as its object. The nominal phrases preceding and following the verb in (1) are both ambiguous with respect to case; they may be nominative or accusative. Further, both NPs agree in number with the verb, and since in German any major constituent may be fronted in a verb-second clause, both NPs may be the subject/object of the verb. In this example, morpho-syntactical information is not sufficient to determine that the nominal phrase"]},{"title":"[NP","paragraphs":["die C)konomin] ('the economist') is the subject of the verb, and"]},{"title":"[NP","paragraphs":["Eine hohe Inflationsrate] ('a high inflation rate') its object.","Determining the subject/object of an ambiguous construct such as (1) with a knowledge-based approach requires (at least) a lexical representation specifying the classes of entities which may serve as arguments in the relation(s) denoted by each verb in the vocabulary, as well as membership information with respect to these classes for all entities denoted by nouns in the vocabulary. One problem with this approach is that it is usually not available for a broad-coverage system.","This paper proposes an approximation, similar to the empirical approaches to PP attachment decision (Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos, 1994; Collins and Brooks, 1995). These make use of unambiguous examples provided by a treebank or a learning procedure in order to train a model to decide the attachment of ambiguous constructs. In the current setting, this approach involves learning the classes of nouns occurring unambiguously as subject/object of a verb in sample text, and using the classes thus obtained to disambiguate ambiguous constructs.","Unambiguous examples are provided by sentences in which morpho-syntactical information suffices to determine the subject and object of the verb. For instance in (2), the nominal phrase"]},{"title":"[NP","paragraphs":["der C)konom] with a masculine head noun is unambiguously nominative, identifying it as the subject of the verb.

The corpus is tokenized, morphologically analyzed, lemmatized, and parsed using a standard CFG parser with a hand-written grammar to identify clauses containing a finite verb taking a nominative NP as its subject and an accusative NP as its object.","Constructs covered by the grammar include verb-second and verb-final clauses. Each clause is segmented into phrase-like constituents, including nominative (NC), prepositional (PC), and verbal (VC) constituents. Their definition is non-standard; for instance, all prepositional phrases, whether complement or not, are left unattached. As an example, the shallow parse structure for the sentence in (4) is shown in (4') below.","(4) Die Gesellschaft erwartet in diesem Jahr the society expects in this year in Siidostasien einen Umsatz in southeast Asia a turnover von 125 Millionen DM. from 125 million DM 'The society expects this year in southeast Asia a turnover of 125 million DM.'","(4') [S [NC3.,.~ ....... ~ Die Gesellschaft] [vc3.. erwartet] [PC in diesem Jahr]"]},{"title":"IRe","paragraphs":["in Sfidostasien] [NC3 ...... einen Umsatz]"]},{"title":"[PC","paragraphs":["yon 125 Millionen DM]"]},{"title":"]","paragraphs":["Nominal and verbal constituents display person and number information; nominal constituents also display case information.
