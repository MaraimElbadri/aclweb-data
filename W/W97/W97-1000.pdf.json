The last seven years, however, have seen a growth in interest and, correspondingly, in meetings addressing this topic. These have been held under the auspices of: COLING (The Unfinished Language, 90), DARPA (90/91), AAAI (MLNLO/CNLP, 91/93), IJCAI (NLL, 91), ECML (Machine Learning and Text Analysis, 93), the European Networks of Excellence ELSNET and MLNET (MLNLS, 94), and ESSLLI (96).","This year, however, is the first time that the ACL's special interest group in natural language learning have organised a meeting in conjunction with an (E)ACL conference. The papers contained in this volume are those which have been accepted to the conference.","In this meeting, we have attempted to cover as broad a range of topics within the field as possible. The range extends from message understanding, through word categorization, ambiguity resolution, learner modelling and text segmentation to the application of neural neworks for learning speech and phonology.","The combination of this vibrant field, with the occasion of joint EACL/ACL meeting make the studies collected in this volume an exciting and stimulating representation of the field.","I would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellows on the program committee, and the other reviewers who helped contributed towards this workshop.
