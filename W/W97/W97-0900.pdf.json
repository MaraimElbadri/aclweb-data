The workshop, held on July 12, 1997 at the Universidad National de Educacion a Distancia in Madrid, Spain, was sponsored by Association for Computational Linguistics and the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics. Success in the marketplace is one form of validation for NLP techniques and underlying theories. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers to discuss commercial and commercial-bound systems that use NLP. Our interest is to learn about systems that show promise in re-using NLP techniques, share experiences of the process of technology transfer for NLP applications, and explore industry-based practical considerations involving NLP technology. The workshop is intended to open a dialogue among the research community about experiences and problems -- technical, logistic, or cultural -- encountered by people working on operational and commercial NLP applications. These include issues in the re-use of domain-specific techniques so that new applications can get leverage from using existing ones. The ability to re-use technology for diverse applications should both give the application a solid grounding, and save time and money. Other issues include technology transfer and industry-based practicalities that often guide the design of NLP technology. These include problems in customization and the trade-offbetween accuracy and other requirements, such as speed, and ease of use. The goal of the workshop is to create connections between academic and industry-based research efforts in order to build a solid infrastructure for NLP technology re-use and lead to a deeper understanding of commercial NLP potential.
