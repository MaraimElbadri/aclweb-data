Since our translation strategy chooses the best match rule in the context, if the condition of (2) is satisfied, the rule (2) is chosen although the condition of (1) is satisfied, too. The honorific expression is thus adopted prior to the normal one when translation is performed from English to Japanese. The same goes for the rules, (3) and (4).

This property, on the one hand, allows us to import our knowledge in machine translation into speech-to-speech translation as default and, on the other hand, enables us to improve incrementally the quality of translation by adding to the rule-base the rules applicable only in particular contexts as more sources of information are made available to the system. 93"]}]}
