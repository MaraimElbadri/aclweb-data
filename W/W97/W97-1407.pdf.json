In this paper, first we analyze sentences used as the scene directions, and classify them. Then we propose the rules to extract subjects and predicates from those sentences. With the extracted subjects and predicates, we build the existence/action map that explains the situations happening on each scene. The existence/action map we build describes scenes very correctly as for whether each player appears in each scene or not. Our experiment shows that the recall is around 80% and the precision is over 90%. This means that our system of inferring reference relations works well for scene directions. Then we develop the scene retrieval system in which this map is used to retrieve scenes from the drama video database according to the input query. We also show some experimental results of our retrieval system. 1 Introduction In conventional multimedia retrieval systems, image data are indexed manually because image processing technologies have not yet provided us with image understanding methods that are powerful enough to automatically extract useful indices from image data themselves. Then, in order to enhance multimedia retrieval systems, we have to employ other types of information source. That is why we focus here on drama scripts that are apparently natural language media. However it is obvious that only using scripts does not guarantee effective retrieval. The essential point is, of course, the combination of information from language resource and image data. This combination can drastically improve the quality and efficiency of multimedia retrieval. From this point of view, reference relations between a description of script and an actor/actress who actually plays in the drama scenes that correspond to the script are the most useful pieces of information for scene retrieval, and consequently they become our research targets. If we successfully identify this kind of reference, it is a great help for multimedia information retrieval, especially scene retrieval from data base of drama videos. However the whole script of drama is so complicated that we cannot deal with by today's natural language processing technologies. Then we concentrate our focus here on scene directions that explain the situation of each scene in the drama, for instance, actors/actresses' position, movement, and SO on.","In section 2 we describe the pieces of information which describe a scene. In section 3 we explain our natural language processing system that extracts information describing each scene. There we also show the experimental results of our natural language processing system. In section 4, we show some results of scene retrieval system. Section 5 is the conclusion."]},{"title":"2","paragraphs":["Scene Descriptions Each scene of a drama is characterized by the following five types of information. 1. Location of the scene. 2.

Namely","who is the subject, and what action or state the","referent of the subject does or is in. Therefore it is","enough to extract the subject and the verb (or 'the","verb + the auxiliary verb'). 3.2 Subject Extraction Subjects are extracted by matching the patterns S generated by the following rules. rule 1 P is a proper name or a common noun. rule 2 P <-- P \",\"P rule 3 P +- P \"to \"P, where \"to\" means 'and' in","English. rule 4 S <-- P \",\"1 P"]},{"title":"\"ga\"l P \"wa\"l","paragraphs":["P \"me\" Here a subject corresponds to P.

A sentence of this pattern usually describes the atmosphere of the scene. As for pattern 3, we have to infer the referent of omitted subject, namely"]},{"title":"zero subject.","paragraphs":["We have a plenty of theories for this purpose including centering theories (Brennan et. al, 1987; Kameyama, 1988; Walker et. al , 1994). Here, however, we employ a very simple rule as follows. rule 7 The referent of zero subject is the same as","the referent of subject of the previous sentence. This rule is a small subset of centering theory, but as you will see later, it works well to extract a subject from a sentence of scene direction. We also apply this rule for a complex sentence in which a subject of main clause is omitted. Namely the omitted subject is deemed to corefer with the explicit subject of subordinate clause. The reason of this is that 1) in a scene direction, a sequence of actions is described, and 2) in a complex sentence of scene direction, a subordinate clause describes an action or state that happens prior to the action or state described by the main clause. In other words, a subordinate and a main clause of the complex sentence can be regarded as two consecutive simple sentences. 3.3 Predicate Extraction As for pattern 1, 2 and 3, we can extract a predicate just by extracting a verb or a verb + an auxiliary verb from the sentence. In pattern 4, we cannot identify the exact action or state from the sentence. But at least, we know that there exists a person the subject refers to. Therefore a predicate extracted from a sentence of pattern 4 is regarded as \"exist\" by default. We couldn't find any reasonable predicate for sentences of pattern 5 and 6. Then we also use \"exist\" in these patterns as we do in pattern 4. In sum, we use the following rule to extract a predicate from a scene direction.","rule 8 A predicate of the sentence is either a verb ( + an auxiliary verb) used in a sentence of pattern 1, 2, or 3, or \"exist'in a sentence of pattern 4, 5or 6."]},{"title":"3.4 Building An Existence/Action Map","paragraphs":["In this system, the purpose of semantic interpreta-tion is limited to build an existence/action map from the extracted subjects and predicates by the way described in section 3.2 and 3.3. For this purpose, the key element of predicate is the so called directional auxiliary verb(Kuno, 1978). There are several directional auxiliary verbs in Japanese. Among them, the most essential ones for our purpose are \"-tekuru\" and \"-teiku\". The directions indicated by these auxiliary verbs are defined relative to the position of camera. If \"-tekuru\" is a part of the predicate of sentence, a referent of the subject of the sentence comes into the camera angle and/or is approaching the camera. If \"-teiku\" is a part of the predicate of sentence, a referent of the subject of the sentence goes away from the camera and probably is out of the camera angle. The situation is depicted as shown in figure 1.","Figure 1: Movement of \"tekuru\" and \"teiku\" scene camera"]},{"title":"0 ' kuru '","paragraphs":["q"]},{"title":"'iku', ~_","paragraphs":["In addition, basic verbs, \"kuru('come')\" and \"iku('go')\", also express the same type of sense of direction as \"-tekuru\" and \"-teiku\" do respectively. By these considerations, we drive the following two default rules to infer existence or absence of the referent of the subject in the scene.","rule 9 If the predicate of sentence includes an auxiliary verb \"-tekuru\" or a verb \"kuru\", a referent of the subject of the sentence had not been in the scene beforehand, and just has come into the scene.","rule 10 If the predicate of sentence includes an auxiliary verb \"-teiku\" or a verb \"iku\", a referent of the subject of the sentence will not exist in the scene afterward.","Of course, these two rules are default rules, and there are exceptional cases. For instance, if a sentence explicitly describes that Taroo has existed in the scene beforehand, even though we encounter the sentence that","tikayot -tekuru. (7) Taroo SUB approach 'Taroo approaches to here.' , we infer that Taroo has already been in the scene. Or in \"-teiku\" case, if the sentence:"]},{"title":"(s)","paragraphs":["Taroo, ttanako -ni tikayot -teiku. SUB -DAT approach 'Taroo approaches to Hanako.'","is followed by the sentence: Taroo Hanako -ni","(9) SUB -DAT nagur -areru. hit -PASSIVE 'Taroo is hit by Hanako.'",", then we infer that Taroo is still in the scene after the action described by (9)."]},{"title":"Scene Direction Based Reference in Drama Scenes 55","paragraphs":["Another exceptional case is that a verb is either stative or state change without action. For instance, the sentence: (10)","kaoiro-ga-warukunat -teiku. Taroo SUB become pale 'Taroo turns pale.'","indicates that Taroo is still in the scene when he looks pale. We can identify these kind of verbs, stative and state change without action, with a dictionary like IPAL-Basic Verb Dictionary For Computer(IPA, 1990).","Although the rules and the treatment of exceptional cases are very important, generally if a sentence of scene direction describes that the referent of subject does an action or is in a certain state, the referent surely exists in the scene. Another group of expressions that are frequently used and are important to build an existence/action map are a stative verb \"iru('exist')\" and its negation \"inai('not exist').\" They explicitly show the existence or non-existence of a referent of subject in the scene. Then we have the following two rules.","rule 11 If a sentence describes an action or state, the referent of the subject is in the scene.","rule 12 If \"iru\" is used as a predicate, the referent of the subject is in the scene. If \"inai\" is used as a predicate, the referent of the subject is not in the scene.","These two rules can override the results we infer by rule 9 or rule 10, because rule 9 and 10 are default rules and rule 11 and 12 explicitly describe the scene. One question we have here is that if we encounter a negative predicate like \"inai\", how should we infer. However, in reality, we don't find negative predicates except for \"inai\" in scene directions, because scene directions describe what players should do in the scene, and they almost never describe what players shouldn't do in the scene. Things not to be done in a scene are usually directed by the human director of the drama.","Now we show an example of existence/action map built from the following scene directions.","(11) Taroo to Jiro ga","and SUB kaet -tekuru. come back 'Taroo and Jiro come back.'","Taroo \" tadaima \"","(12) SUB \" I'm home \" 'Taroo says \" I'm home.\"'","(13) Hanako ~ \"gokurousan\"","UB \" you did well. \" 'IIanako says \" You did well\"'","(14) to nagusameru. and comfort 'and comforts two of them.'

A sub-scene is a unit of retrieval because players on the scene change in a sub-scene by sub-scene manner as you see in an existence/action map. Therefore we have to find the correspondence between a sub-scene and a set of real image frames. The multimedia data we have consist of 1) a sequence of image frames, 2) audio track data, and 3) script of drama including scene directions. The temporal correspondence, or in other words synchronization, of these three types of media data is calculated with DP matching technique we have already developed(Yaginuma, 1993). Owing to these correspondences, we identify each set of frames that corresponds to the each part of dialog. Then we regard a set of sequential frames between two adjacent lines of dialog as the sub-scene corresponding to the scene direction.","Based on these structures holding among image frames and sub-scene, we can retrieve an image frame that corresponds to a query, by the following procedure.","1. Input a query that consists of the time, location, player's name and her/his action.","2.
