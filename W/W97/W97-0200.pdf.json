The first six papers discuss what information should be tagged and how human tagging (hand-tagging) can be performed so as to maximize accuracy. Hand-tagging is important because it can be used to create standard corpora on which to train and evaluate automated methods for tagging lexical semantic information. The next seven papers concentrate on such automated methods. Automatic tagging should prove useful in a variety of areas including machine translation, information retrieval, information extraction, and dialog understanding. Although the general topic is tagging lexical semantic information, the majority of the papers concentrate on a more specific problem: word sense disambiguation. However, particular word senses often entail general lexical semantic information. For example, if the sense of bank used refers to something that lies along a river, then one knows that it is a natural formation, inanimate, etc. Consider also the verb bounce which in she bounced a check is a telic and in she bounced a ball is an activity. Such entailments are especially transparent when using a structured lexicon such as WordNet, which is the case for many of the papers in the volume. The workshop itself and these proceedings are the result of many people's efforts. The people who submitted articles provided high quality papers to choose from, the program committee provided in depth reviews and did so punctually, the presenters and workshop leaders provided polished final documents in a timely fashion, and Priscilla Rasmussen answered many questions regarding money matters, hotel reservations, etc. To all these people, thanks! In addition, a very special thanks to Martha Palmer who both served on the program committee and acted as a ghost co-chair, providing general guidance and answering questions on a myriad of topics. The members of the program committee should not go unnamed: Martha Evens, Helmut Feldweg, Michael Johnston, Douglas Jones, Kevin Knight, Boyan Onyshkevych, Martha Palmer, Philip Resnik, Evelyne Viegas, David Yarowsky, and Annie Zaenen. Finally, I would like to gratefully acknowledge the US Government inter-agency TIPSTER Text Program which provided partial funding for the workshop."]},{"title":"Marc Light Program Chair March, 1997 University of Tiibingen, Germany","paragraphs":["///"]},{"title":"m mm m • TABLE OF CONTENTS Presentations","paragraphs":["Getting serious about word sense disambiguation (invited talk) Hwee Tou Ng ...................................................................................... 1","Ezperience in WordNet sense tagging in the Wall Street Journal Janyce Wiebe, Julie Maples, Lei Duan, and Rebecca Bruce ......................................... 8","Desiderata .for tagging with WordNet synsets or MCCA categories Kenneth C.
