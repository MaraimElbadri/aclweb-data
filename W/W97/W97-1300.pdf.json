We have also seen a tendency towards the development of robust and effective methods to meet the demand of practical NLP systems and to enhance further the automatic processing of growing language resources. This clear trend towards inexpensive, relatively knowledge-poor, corpus-based methods has been evident in recent proposals which address the anaphora resolution problem by deliberately limiting the extent to which they rely on domain and/or linguistic knowledge, and by moving away from the traditional domain/sublanguage restriction. We believe that the time is fight for the ACL'97/EACL'97 workshop \"Operational factors in practical, robust anaphora resolution for unrestricted texts\". It presents the latest work on the practical requirements of operational and reliable anaphora resolution components. It also investigates the role of, and interactions among, the various factors in anaphora resolution - in particular those that scale well, or that translate easily to knowledge-poor environments. We are pleased to report a high level of interest in the workshop, which resulted in a large number of quality submissions. Regrettably, this translated into some hard choices concerning the final programme make-up. There can only be a limited number of presentations in a one day workshop; thus, following a review process where every submission was reviewed by three members of the Programme Committee, some good papers did not find a slot in the workshop programme. We trust that the workshop will be a timely forum for fruitful discussion and that it will give a strong impetus to further advances in the field.
