On the one hand, current generation systems allow for the production of flexible utterances. They may be utilized to overcome the limitations of Human-Computer Interfaces with stereotyped language output. However, they typically neglect aspects of intonation and hand over the resulting text in graphemic form to a speech synthesis component.","On the other hand, current speech synthesizers implement the so-called Text-to-Speech approach. They are able to read aloud unrestricted text. One of the main problems posed by that paradigm is the production of adequate prosody since the written form of a text that is to be articulated is a poor knowledge source. Prosodic features of an utterance are highly dependent on the informational structure, on the linguistic structure, and on the situational context of the utterance.","A tight interaction between generation and synthesis should contribute to enhance the quality of a system's output. A component for speech synthesis may be provided with relevant parameters to compute adequate intonation. A generation system may utilize options of speech synthesis during its decisions of tactical or strategic generation, e.g., reflect the information structure either by intonational cues or via morpho-syntactic variations (e.g. changing of word order).","Concept-to-Speech (CTS) generation, i.e., the production of synthetic speech on the basis of pragmatic, semantic, and discourse knowledge offers a challenging and relatively new field of research in intelligent user interfaces. The questions raised in such an environment range from pragmatics, semantics, and (morpho-)syntax to phonology and phonetics. The modelling of prosody (at symbolic and acoustic level) serves as one of the open questions within this paradigm. Obviously, the development of a CTS system is very demanding. Successful work within the framework of CTS relies on the ability to integrate efforts from a number of disciplines, such as Computational Linguistics, Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science, and Signal Processing.","The workshop will provide a forum to bring together researchers from the fields of natural language generation and speech synthesis. The aim of the workshop is to stimulate interchange of innovative ideas and results of diverse aspects of CTS generation in order to bridge the gap between these fields. iv","Among the challenging aspects of a CTS system, we proposed to address issues of the following list in the first place:","Â• How can systems for natural language generation be adapted in order to utilize new realization options to the generation process that are offered in the CTS framework?","Â• How can issues in the time-course of the interleaved process for generation and synthesis (when-to-say) be dealt with? Which requirements on speech synthesis are to be fulfilled in an incremental approach to spoken language production?","Â• Due to its inherent integrational property, being influenced by a whole number of representational levels, modelling of prosody will be one of the major topics of the workshop.","Â• How can approaches in the Text-to-Speech tradition to synthesis show their adaptability to Concept-to-Speech?","We invited contributions that provide solutions to any of the topics indicated above or that present innovative applications addressing the abovementioned issues.
