Since the Japanese orthography has no spaces delimiting words, the first step in building a Japanese speech recognition system is to define the units that will be recognized. Our method applies a compound-finding algorithm, previously used to find word sequences in English, to learning syllable sequences in Japanese. We report that we were able not only to extract meaningful units, eliminating the need for possibly inconsistent manual segmentation, but also to decrease perplexity using this automatic procedure, which relies on a statistical, not syntactic, measure of relevance. Our algorithm also uncovers the kinds of environments that help the recognizer predict phonological alternations, which are often hidden by morphologically-motivated tokenization."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["What defines a word when there are no spaces in a written language? Words, as they are known in English and other western languages, are the basic units of recognition in most CSR systems, but when a language is written as a string of characters with no white space, how does one go about specifying the fundamental units that must be recognized? Mapping onto English-style words is one solution, but an artificial one, and may hide natural characteristics of Japanese that can be important in recognition. Recognizing phonemes, or short phoneme clusters, is another option, but recognition accuracy can improve when we have longer phoneme strings to work with; acoustic confusability decreases and a long word is a more useful predictor of subsequent words than a single syllable. Automatic segmenting tools eliminate an often inconsistent manual segmentation step, but are generally based on morphological analysis, which can produce units smaller than are desirable for speech recognition. Certainly, there exist words as can be looked up in a dictionary, but when a language is as heavily inflected as Japanese is, that only solves part of the problem. In this paper we describe an automatic process for learning base units in Japanese and discuss its usefulness for speech recognition."]},{"title":"2 The problem with Japanese","paragraphs":["The Japanese language is written without spaces in between words. This means that before one can even start designing a recognition or translation system for Japanese the units that will be recognized, or translated, must be defined. Many sequences of phonemes, particularly those representing nouns, are clearly independent and can be designated as freestanding units. Japanese has a rich and fusional inflectional system, though, and delimiting where a verb ending ends and another begins, for example, is seldom straightforward.","Japanese has typically been segmented in variations on four ways for the purposes of recognition and parsing, although since many papers on Japanese recognition do not specify what units they are using, or how they arrived at the definition of a \"word\" in Japanese, it is hard to compare systems.","Â• Phrase/Bunsetsu level: (Early ASURA (Morimoto et al. , 1993), QJP (Kameda, 1996))","-advantages: long enough for accurate recognition, captures common patterns","- disadvantages: requires dictionary entry for each possible phrase; vocabulary explosion Â• \"Word\" level: (JANUS (Schultz and Koll, Mayfield Tomokiyo ~ Ries 60 Learning base units in Japanese Laura Mayfield Tomokiyo and Klaus Ries (1997) What makes a word: Learning base units in Japanese for speech recognition.

Until very recently most implementations of this idea have made use of measures of cooccurrence that have been useful in other domains, and the pair is chosen by maximizing that criterion. In contrast we assume that we want to model the corpus with a statistical language model and search for those sequences that increase the modeling power of the model by the largest amount. Our measure-ments are based on information theoretic principles and the usage of m-gram models of language, a common practice in the speech community. The model described here will therefore implicitly consider the words surrounding the phrase candidates and use information about the context to determine the good-ness of a sequence, which is in contrast to traditional measures.","(Ries et al., 1996) has compared a variety of measure as reported in the literature and has found these to be not competitive with the new technique if used in statistical language models. In a very vague statement we want to add that this corresponds to the experience in eyeballing these sequences.

This paper for the most part ignores the search problem. The acoustic model is in part influenced by the sequences since we can change the entries in the pronunciation dictionary that encode the phoneme sequences the speech system uses to generate its models. During this generation process most modern systems make only partial use of neighboring words and the construction process is up to date also unable to model contractions, especially at word boundaries. It is therefore of great advantage to have a basic unit in the decoder that allows for manual or automatic dictionary modification that captures these phenomena. This has recently been reported to be a very promising modeling idea on several different speech recognition tasks in English. The underlying assumption is that sequences of units that have a high stickiness are by conventional usage very likely to show idiosyncratic pronuncations much like single words do: They are for the most part lexicalized.","The statistical language modeling problem for the sequence of words W = Wl,...,wn where wn is a special end of sentence symbol can then be rephrased as n","p(W) = rIp(w~lwl,..., w,_x) i=1 We will for most applications probably never be able to find enough data to estimate p as presented above. An often practiced shortcut is therefore to assume that each word is only dependent on the last m - 1 words and that this distribution is the same in all positions of the string. These models are called m-gram models and have proved to be very effective in a large number of applications, even though they are a naive model of language.","Information theoretic measures (Cover and Thomas, 1991) are frequently used to describe the power of language models. (Cover and Thomas, 1991) shows in chapter 4.2 that the entropy rate of a random process converges, under additional assumptions, to the entropy of the random source. This has been taken as the justification for using an approximation of a notational difference of the entropy rate,dubbed perplexity, as a measure of the strength of the language model. Given a bigram model p and a test text wl,..., w,~ the perplexity PP is defined as PP = 2- ~ ~=1 logP(w,lw,_~) where we make usage of a special \"start-of-sentence\" symbol as w0. In the sequel we happily ignore this for notational convenience.","Since we will be changing the basic unit during the sequence finding procedure it is useful to normalize the perplexity onto one standard corpus. Say the standard test corpus has length n and the new test corpus has length n' we define for the test corpus ppret = pp-~. ppr~l is therefore a notational variant of the probability of the test text given the model which is independent of the used sequences of words and is the only meaningful measure in this context.","The calculation of the model p itself from empirical data involves a number of estimation problems. We are using the well understood and empirically tested backoff method, as recently described e.g. by (Kneser and Ney, 1995). 3.2 Algorithm description The idea of the algorithm is to search for sequences that reduce the relative perplexity of the corpus in an optimal way. For example, if we were working with a bigram model and came across the sequence credit card bill, not only would we have to choose among words like \"report,\" \"history\" and \"check\" as possible successors for \"credit,\" but the word \"card\" itself has many senses and \"game,\" \"shop\" and \"table\" might all be more likely followers of \"card\" than \"bill,\" if no other context is known. By creating a new word, credit_card, we eliminate one choice and decrease the surprise of seeing the next word.","Since the new word is now treated exactly like other word instances in the corpus, it can in turn be the first or second half of a future joining operation, leading to multi-word compounds.","The sequence-finding algorithm iterates over all word pairs in a training corpus, and in each iteration chooses the pair (recall that one or both elements of this pair can themselves be sequences) that reduces the bigram perplexity the most. This can be done by just calculating the number of times all possible word triples appeared and going over this table (except for those entries that have a count of zero) Mayfield Tomokiyo 8J Ries 62 Learning base units in Japanese once. This is iterated until no possible compound reduces perplexity. This technique is obviously just an approximation of an algorithm that considers all word sequences at once and would allow the statistical model to produce the components of a sequence separately. The clustering is therefore a bottom up procedure and during the training of our models we are making a variation of the Viterbi assumption in joining the sequences in the corpus blindly.","For the corpora we worked with, this technique was sufficiently fast with the efficient implementa-tion described in (Ries et al., 1996), which makes further use of estimation tools from pattern recognition such as the leaving one out technique.","Inspired by (Lauer, 1995), we have very recently extended this technique so that the algorithm has the option of, instead of replacing a sequence of two units by a new symbol, replacing it by either the left or right component of that sequence. The idea is that the resulting model could capture head information. We have tested this approach on some of our English corpora; the resulting sequences look unpromising, however, and the new option was seldom used by the algorithm. 3.3 Application to Japanese Realizing that the phrase-finding procedure we used on English and German was producing units that were both statistically important and semantically meaningful, we decided to apply the same techniques to Japanese. We needed units that were long enough for recognition and wanted to generalize on inflected forms that are used over and over again with different stems, as well as longer sequences that are frequently repeated in the domain. Other motivations for such a process include: Â• language model estimation","Â• preserving important cross-morphological phonetic environments Â• inconsistency of human transcribers","Â• search sub-optimality due to poorly chosen units","The approach described in Section 3.2 is a bottom-up approach to sequence finding, and the segmentation of Japanese is more intuitively viewed as a top-down problem in which an input string is broken down to some level of granularity. In apply-ing the algorithm in (Ries et al., 1996) to Japanese, we reversed the problem, first breaking the corpus down to the smallest possible stand-alone units in Japanese, and then building up again, constructing phrases.","We chose the mora as our fundamental unit. A mora is a suprasegmental unit similar to a syllable, with the important distinctions that a mora does not need to contain a vowel (syllabic /n/ and the first of double consonants are considered independent morae) and a mora-based segmentation would treat long vowels as two morae. The word gakkoo (school) would be two syllables, but four morae: gak-ko-o. Each kana of the Japanese syllabary represents one mora. In some cases kana can be combined and remain a single mora; kyo, as in Tokyo, is an example.","There is some argument as to whether it is natural to break multi-phoneme (CV) kana down further, to the phoneme level; specifically, some analyses of Japanese verb inflections consider the root to include the first phoneme of the alternating kana, as shown in Table 1.","kana phoneme example stem intl. stem intl. hashi ra hashir a hashiranai hashi ri hashir i hashirimasu hashi ru hashir u hashiru hashi re hashir e hashireba hashi ro hashir o hashiroo Table 1: kana-based vs. phoneme-based analyses of verb stems and inflections","The nasal consonant kana is considered an independent unit.","The problem of segmentation is not unique to Japanese; there are other languages without spaces in the written language, and verb conjugations and other inflective forms are issues in almost any language. Words as defined by orthography can be more a curse than a blessing, as having such convenient units of abstraction at our disposal can blind us to more natural representations.","(Ito and Kohda, 1996) describes an approach similar to ours. Our work is different because of the phrase finding criterion we use, which is to maximize the predictive power of the m-gram model directly. The recent (Ries et al., 1996) showed that a variation of that measure, coined bigram perplexity, outperforms classical measures often used to find phrases. For Chinese (Law and Chan, 1995), a similar measure was combined with a tagging scheme since the basic dictionary already consisted of 80,000 words. The algorithm presented in (Ries et al., 1996) is comparatively attractive computationally, and avoids problems with initialization as it works Mayfield Tomokiyo 8J Ries 63 Learning base units in Japanese in pure bottom up fashion. Ries did not find specific improvements from using word classes in the tasks under consideration.","Masataki (Masataki and Sagisaka, 1996) describes work on word grouping at ATR, although what they describe is critically different in that they are grouping previously defined words into sequences, not defining new words from scratch. Nobesawa presents a method for segmenting strings in (Nobesawa et al. , 1996) which uses a mutual information criterion to identify meaningful strings. They evaluate the correctness of the segmentation by cross-referencing with a dictionary, however, and seem to depend to a certain extent on grammar conventions. More-over, a breaking-down approach is less suitable for speech recognition applications than a building-up one because the risk of producing out-of-vocabulary strings is higher. Teller and Batchelder (Teller and Batchelder, 1994) describe another segmentation algorithm which uses extensively knowledge about the type of a character (hiragana/katakana/kanji, etc). This work, though, as well as Nobesawa's, is designed for processing Japanese text, and not speech.","Our process is similar to noun compounding procedures, such as described in (Lauer, 1995), but does not use a mutual information criterion. The algorithm was originally developed to find sequences of words in English, initially in order to reduce language model perplexity, then to predict sequences that would be contracted in fast speech, again in English. The work described in this paper is an application of this algorithm to learning of word units in Japanese. 4 Evaluation Since the phrase-finding algorithm described in 3.2 is designed to maximize bigram perplexity, the evaluations described here measure this criterion. 4.1 Task The Spontaneous Scheduling Task (SST) databases are a collection of dialogues in which two speakers are trying to schedule a time to meet together. Speakers are given a calendar and asked to find a two-hour slot given the constraints marked on their respective calendars. Dialogues have been collected for English (ESST), German (GSST), Spanish (SSST), Korean (KSST) and Japanese (JSST). 4.2 Test corpora Six language models were created for the scheduling task JSST (Schultz and Koll, 1997).

Corpus C4 was a hand-edited version of C3, where some word classes (like day of the week - if only \"tuesday\" existed in the corpus the rest of the days were added by hand) were fleshed out and superfluous chunks removed.","5. Corpus C5 was the hand-segmented text used in the current JSST system, with the errorful segmentations described in 5 6. Corpus C6 was C5 + chunks from C4","Only experiments involving romanized corpora were used. The choice of using romanized text over kana text was primarily based on the requirements of our language modeling toolkit; we used a one=to-one mapping between kana and roman characters. Equipped with a list of chunks (between 800 and 900 were identified in these corpora), one can always reproduce kanji representations. Breaking down a kanji-based corpus, though, would require a dictionary entry for each individual kanji, of which there are over 2500 that occur in our database. Not only is this difficult to do, given the 3-12 possible readings for each kanji, we would be left after the chunking process with singleton kanji for which it is often impossible to determine the correct reading out of context. One experiment combining chunks extracted from a kanji corpus with chunks from a kana corpus was performed, but the results were not encouraging. Kanji are an extremely informative form of representation, and we will continue to look for ways to incorporate them in future work. However, experiments do show that even without them phrase-building can produce significant results. 4.3 Perplexity results The relative perplexities reported below are all normalized with respect to corpus C1.

The mora dictionary has only 189 word types because it comprises only the legal syllables in Japanese, plus the letters of the alphabet, human and non-human noise, and some other symbols. The word dictionary, used in modeling C5 and C6, had 2357 word types.","To make the results as strong as possible we used a pseudo closed vocabulary for C5 and C6. This means that we included all word types that occur in the training and test set in the vocabulary. The dictionary size is therefore exactly the number of word types found in both training and test sets and in-cludes the number of sequences added to the model. This favors C5 and C6 strongly, since words that are not in the dictionary cannot be predicted by the language model at all nor can a speech recognition system detect them. However this setup at least guarantees that the models built for C5 and C6 predict all words on the test set as C1-4 do. For larger tasks we assume that the unknown word problem in Japanese will be very pronounced.","A speech system can obviously recognize only words that are in its dictionary. Therefore, every unknown word causes at least one word error, typically even more since the recognizer tries to fit in another word with a pronounciation that does not fit in well. This may lead to wrong predictions of the language model and to wrong segmentations of the acoustic signal into base units. C1-C4 have a closed vocabulary that can in principle recognize all possible sentences and these segmentations do not suffer from this problem.","In English, this would be equivalent to having been able to build phoneme based language models that are better than word models, even if we choose the vocabulary such that we have just covered the training and test sets. In some pilot experiments we actually ran the sequence finding procedure on an English phoneme corpus and a letter corpus without word boundaries and found that the algorithm tends to discover short words and syllables; however, the resulting models are not nearly as strong as word models. 5 Emergence of units One of the exciting things about this study was the emergence of units that are contracted in fast and casual speech. A problem with morphological breakdowns of Japanese, which are good for the purposes of speech recognition because they are consistent and publicly available tokenizers can be used, is that multi-morph units are often abbreviated in casual speech (as in \"don't know\" ~ \"dunno\" in English) and segmenting purely along morphological boundaries hides the environment necessary to capture these phenomena of spontaneous speech. We found that the chunking process actually appeared to be extracting these sequences. 5.1 Reducible sequences captured Following is an example comparing the chunking to the original (termed word-based here) segmentation in JSST.

Once it has access to this information, it can train its expected pronunciations of the. sequence \"kereba\" to include \"kya\" pronunciations as they occur in the spoken corpus.

Even /te/and/ta/are shorter than would normally be desired, although Japanese phonemes appear to be less confusible than their English and German counterparts (Schultz and Koll, 1997)Â• Units such as (shite) and (imashita), as produced by our algorithm, are long enough to be distinguishable from other words, yet short enough to generalizeÂ• Since the basic unit from which we were building was the mora, ending up with units that were too short was a concern. We found that the average unit length in mora was comparable to that of the hand-segmented system, howeverÂ•","It is also important, though, to control the vocabulary size if a reasonable search space is desiredÂ• Early experiments with recognizing at the bunsetsu level in Korean indicated that vocabulary did explode, since most full bunsetsu were used only once. The vocabulary growth actually did level off even-tually, but the initial growth was unacceptable, and we switched to a syllable-based system in the end. Figure 5.2 shows vocabulary growth rates in Janus for different languages in the scheduling domain.

Because of the way our stopping criterion is defined, we can infer from the fact that the full phrase was not extracted that by form-ing this compound we would actually have increased the difficulty of the corpus; more analysis is needed to understand exactly why. 6 Conclusion The results reported here show that we can get similar entropies in our language model by using an automatic process to segment the data. This means that we do not have to rely on human segmenters, which can be inconsistent and time consuming. We can also tailor the segmentation style to the task; the inflected forms and general word choice in casual and formal speech are very different, and our method allows us to target those which are most relevant. This is in itself a significant result.","Additionally, we found that our method finds sequences which are likely to undergo contractions and reductions in casual speech. This has implications not only for Japanese, but also for speech recognition in general. If our algorithm is finding a natural base unit in Japanese, we should be able to use a similar approach to find units more natural than the word in other languages. 7 Acknowlegdements This research was performed at the University of Karlsruhe and at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh.
