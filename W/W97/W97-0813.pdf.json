In this paper we will focus on the use of lexico-semantic information, and will try to tackle the related problem of measuring the semantic similarity between the surrounding context of the word to be disarnbiguated and typical patterns of use of that word in a dictionary database. In the literature, semantic similarity is usually assessed with reference to a hierarchically structured thesaurus (e.g. WordNet, [Miller, 1990]). The goal of the paper is to investigate an alternative way of measuring semantic similarity, based on distributional evidence, and to show that this evidence can reliably be used to disambiguate words in context. To this end, we will make use of textual and lexical resources of Italian: nonetheless we are convinced that the general point made in this paper has a cross-linguistic validity."]},{"title":"2 Semantic Similarity and WSD","paragraphs":["Most methods proposed in the literature for establishing the semantic similarity of words try to map a given word * The work reported in tills paper was jointly earned out by the authors in the framework of the SPARKLE (Shallow PARsing and Knowledge extraction for Language Engineering) project (LE-2111).

Eventually, the sense supported by those patterns which are semantically closer to the context in question is selected as the most likely one (see, among others, [Dolan, 1994], [Resnik, 1995a, 1995b], [Agirre and Rigau, 1996], [Sanfilippo, 1997]).","Suppose that one wants to disambiguate the sense of accendere in the verb-object pair accendere-televlsione 'switch on-tv'. The relevant sense of accendere can be inferred-on the basis of known examples such as accendere 2-radio 'switch on-radio': this inference is supported by any seman/i'c hierarchy where both radio and television are specified for the same hyperonym, e.g. 'device', whether immediate or not.","Thesaural relationships such as hyperonymy and synonymy, however, do not always capture the dimension of similarity relevant to the context in question. Consider the verb accendere in the context accendere-pipa 'light-pipe'. The table below contains typical objects of two senses of accendere, 'light' (sense 1) and 'switch on' (sense 2) as they are attested in the Collins Italian-English Dictionary [1985], together with the objects' corresponding hyperonyms according to a monolingual Italian dictionary [Garzanti, 1984]. 90 verb sense accendere_l accenderel accendere_l accendere_l accendere 2 accendere_2 accendere 2 Table object stgaretta 'cigarette' candela 'candle' f~ammoeero 'match' cammo 'fireplace' motore 'engine' lampada 'lamp' radto 'radio'","1st hyper.","small roll lamp ' small suck hollow device source of illumination receiver","nth nth+l hyper, hyper.","Â• > artifact object Â• > artifact Iobject > artifact [object Â• > artifact [object > artifact"]},{"title":"Jobject","paragraphs":[".. > artifact object > artifact Iobject The word ptpa, which Garzanti describes as a smoking tool, does not match any of the immediate hyperonyms of the typical objects of accendere 1 and accendere 2 in Foutt Onbekende schakelo~ie-instructie.. By looking further up in the semantic hierarchy, some similarities are indeed found, but they are based on too general semantic features to be of avail for discriminating among senses 1 and 2 of accendere.","We suggest that, for accendere-pipa to be understood in the appropriate sense, namely accendere 1 as in accenderel-sigaretta 'light-cigarette', semantTc proximity need be computed on different grounds. The relevant similarity with links pipes and cigarettes in this specific context relates to their both being typically smoked objects, a fact which is orthogonal to their general semantic class and can be captured on a distributional basis: p:pa and sigaretta are distributionally equivalent relative to the same verb sense, i.e. they both occur as typical objects of the verb fumare 'smoke'. Distributional equivalence correlates with semantic similarity under the as-sumption that nouns which bear the same syntactic relation to the same verb sense are part-of a semantically coherent class. It turns out that, in examples such as accendere-pipa, distributionally-based semantic similarities can permit more appropriate sense assignments which are specifically tailored to the context to be disambiguated. Observe further that also similarities commonly captured on the basis of thesaural information, as in the case of radio and televtsione above, can in principle be inferred from distributional evidence through relevant contexts of use (e.g. spegnere-radlo 'switch off-radio' and spegnere-televtsione 'switch offtv' in t~ example at hand).","Summing up, we contend that thesaural relationships capture only some of the various dimensions of word sense analogy which appear to play a relevant role in the disambiugation of word co-occurrence patterns. In fact, while thesaural relationships are def'med out of context once and for all, effective analogies are to be tailored to the specific contextual pattern to be disambiguated.

In the literature, the theoretical issue of whether alternating argument structures of the same verb should be associated with a unique sense or with different senses of that verb is still open. In practice, lexicographers' approaches vary considerably, depending on factors such as the dictionary's internal structure or main practical purpose: for instance, in bilingual dictionaries different but alternating argument structures often give rise to different senses, due to differences in their translation. Whatever approach is adopted by the lexicographer, however, SENSE is capable of identifying a sense alternation induced by an alternation of argument structure, or~ alternatively, of recognising two different argument structures as related to the same verb sense, thanks to its ability to deal with asymmetric syntactic dependencies in EB.","To sum up, word sense disambiguation with verb-noun pairs involving asymmetric dependencies is more effective than when only contexts with symmetric dependencies are considered.

Identification of alternative sense assignments, although with lower ranking, comes in handy when the expected TC interpretation is not the attested one. This is reasonable, we believe, since WSD is often a matter of suggesting a set of more or less plausible interpretations in context rather than asserting one interpretation only; by taking attested evidence (no matter how representative) at face value one would wrongly ignore the common fact that, even in real usages, a target context can in fact be understood in more than one way."]},{"title":"3.5 Ranking multiple disambiguation results","paragraphs":["As just shown, distributlonally-based word sense disambiguation does not always make the system converge on a unique interpretation.

Intuitively, preference has to be given to more specific supporting semantic evidence over semantically vaguer one. In our terms, this means that supporting AFs which contain a more specific hook noun should carry more weight for WSD than AFs containing vaguer hook nouns. Usually, generality of a word is measured by referring to a semantic hierarchy. In this context we have used frequency of word occurrence in EB as a convenient measure of \"generality/specificity\" of a word: the more often a hook noun occurs as a subject/object of differents verbs in EB, the more general it can be considered. Note that EB contains only WCP types, so that word counting here is significantly different from counting token frequencies in a real text; type frequency appears to point more decisively to the general structure of lexical competence, rather than to distributional effects in language performance. On this basis, each relevant AF is assigned a specificity score, equal to the inverse ratio of the number of times its hook noun occurs in EB. The ranking score of a given sense interpretation S is then the sum of the specificity scores of all AFs = { AFt, AF~ ..... AF, } supporting"]},{"title":"it:","paragraphs":["Ss~>~,~ = Spec(AF0+ Spec(AF2)+...+ Spec(AF,) where Spec(AF,)= 1/type-frequency(hook_noun).","ha the light of this score, :ranking of the senses of affluwe is reversed: the best disambiguation hypothesis is now aJ: flutre_l (ranking score 0.281046), against afflutre_2 whose ranking score 0.069598 is significantly lower.

By contrast, the same score is significantly lower in the cases supporting the other sense: 0.007194 for persona_l/O and 0.005650 for personal~S; 0.045455 for merce 1/0.","The specificity score tends to overrate very specific analogies, that is analogies supported by analogical families with highly idiosynractic collocates, over more general analogies. To counterbalance this bias, another ranking factor, called the \"coverage\" score, can usefully be exploited in our context. For each available sense interpretation of TC attested in EB, we count how many of its collocates occur as hook nouns of all AFs supporting that sense. Note that, for an AF to support a certain verb sense, it has to contain as a hook noun a collocate of the verb sense S in question. We then assign to S a coverage score S~ov~:~o~, which is proportional to the number of shared collocates: S,~w~e ~ = # nour~collocate(AF(S))/#noun collocate(S) where '# nout~collocate(AF(S))' reads \"cardinality of the noun collocates of the AFs supporting S\", and '# nouncollocate(S)' reads \"cardinality of the noun collocates of S\". The bigger this score, the more widely supported the corresponding sense interpretation in EB. This follows quite naturally in an analogy-based perspective, since, intuitively, two verb senses are considered more similar if they have more collocates in common. Eventually, this score is combined with the other scores considered above to yield a fmal ranking score: S lo~1 ~nS_~or~ = Ssr~:o~ x S~ov~gn_~r~ To give a concrete example, assume that SENSE has to interpret the pattern accostare?-qualcuno_l/O 'approach-somebody'. Accostare is attested in EB in three different senses: accostare_l 'bring_near' with words like chair, object and ladder, among its typical objects; accostare2 'approach' with person as typical object; accostare3 'setajar' said of shutter and door. If the coverage score is not considered, the ranking would be accostare 3 (0.428571), accostare 1 (0.316417), accostare2 (0.12~02) the latter being the appropriate sense in this context. Intuitively this is due to the fact, that, for example, the AFs supporting accostare 3 all exhibit one hook noun only, namely porta, which none~eless contributes a high specificity score, due to its poor type-frequency in EB. Yet, if the coverage score is taken into account, the ranking becomes accostare 2 (2.079136), accostarel (1.582087), accostare3 (0.4~571), with the appropriate sense ranked first."]},{"title":"4 SENSE: experimental results","paragraphs":["Experiments have been carried out with an EB of 8,153 distinct verb-noun patterns (2,488 verb-subject, 5,665 verb-object) automatically extracted from the whole set of verb entries of the Collins bilingual Italian-English dictionary [Montemagni, 1995].

Prehminary results look promising.","The described measure of semantic similarity offers significant advantages compared with methods where word similarity is evaluated either in statistical terms, ultimately based on token frequency, or through reference to a hierarchically structured thesaurus. First, good results are achieved with small quantities of data, part of which are not even semantically disambiguated. Second, the suggested measure is sensitive to similarities'which are relevant to the context being disambiguated, thus overcoming one of the major drawbacks of fixed decontextualised semantic hierarchies.","On a more practical front, this measure was evaluated as an integral part of the disambiguation strategy of SENSE, whose main advantages over other WSD systems can be summarised as follows: Â• SENSE does not take attested evidence at face value","but always entertains other hypotheses; Â• SENSE's inferences are not restricted to contexts","which exhibit symmetric syntactic dependencies, but","also exploit alternations in argument surface realisa-","tion with semantically related verbs; Â• SENSE is sensitive to the semantic general-","ity/specificity of supporting evidence."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[Agirre and Rigau, 1996] E.
