The Hierarchical Semantic-Category-Tree (HSCT) Model","[1]","used semantic features to handle the reordering at sentence level with a rule-based method. The system based on HSCT model could partition a sentence into a predicate and noun phases (NPs for short) and reorder them in sentence level, but this system did not reorder the inner orders in a NP. This paper aims to solve a type of the problem: reorder the inner components in a NP.","In Chinese-English MT, the structural difference in NPs between Chinese to English is a difficult problem, such as the different positions for the head of the NPs: the head of a Chinese NP is in the front; however that of an English NP is in the end. The language for patent usually was inclined to express complicated thought in long and complex words. Here is an example wherein the number of the translation units in a complicated Chinese NP happens to be three.","Example:","Chinese NP:所述图像传感器于红色、蓝色和 绿色色彩通道的光谱灵敏度","English in Chinese order: the image sensor device in red, blue, and green color channels de the spectral sensitivities","Reference: the spectral sensitivities of the image sensor device in red, blue, and green color channels","Google: an image sensor means in said red, blue and green spectral sensitivity of color channel.","The Chinese NP “所述图像传感器于红色、 蓝色和绿色色彩通道的光谱灵敏度”consists of a Chinese character “的” and a function word “于” and three translation units: A“所述图像传 感器”、B“于红色、蓝色和绿色色彩通道” and C“光谱灵敏度”, and the right English order of translation units was “C A B” according to the reference. However, the boundaries of “B and C” and the order of “A, B and C” in English of Google were wrong.","How to recognize the boundaries of the translation units “A, B, C” and how to reorder them were the main problems that to be solved in this paper.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we at first the examined the features of translation units and sum boundary words for recognizing them, then analyzed differences in the orders of complicated Chinese-English NPs and summed a strategy on how to reorder the translation units when translate the complicated Chinese NPs to English. In Section 3, we used a rule-based method and designed a algorithm to recognize the translation units to solve what to reorder and how to reorder. In Section 4, we discussed the experiment results. Section 5 is the related work. Finally, a 76  conclusion is given and the further work is expected in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Analyses of the Chinese NPs","paragraphs":["In this section, we intent to develop a strategy on reorder Chinese NP based on the translation units. 2.1 Translation units","This part focused on examining the features of the translation units and tried to sum some laws on the boundaries for recognizing the translation units.","A translation unit was a word or word-group of expressing the same meaning both in Chinese and English. Translation units were the equivalent in Chinese and English NPs, and it is certain that this study can only be based on contrasting Chinese and English NPs. The complicated Chinese NP consists of NP or prepositional phrases (PP for short), locative phrase (LP for short) etc. The translation unit may be as follows:","(1) NP, which was a smallest unit for","reordering in Chinese-English machine","translation;","(2)PP with a “preposition” and (1)","(3)LP with a “localizer” and (1)","(4)PP with a “preposition”, (1) and a “localizer”","(5) PP with a “preposition”, some (1) and a “localizer”.","2.1.1 Outer Characteristics","In English, prepositions with flexible meanings are frequently used. They function as bonding agents in NPs. In English NPs, the translation units can be obtained by the prepositions, such as “the spectral sensitivities of the image sensor device in red, blue, and green color channels”, the prepositions “of” and “in” can partition the NP into three translation units.","In Chinese NPs, the translation units can be obtained by the prepositions, localizers and the structural particle “的(de)”.  structural particle “的(de)”","Compare and analyze the difference as well as locations between English modifiers and Chinese auxiliary words so that the “的(de)” is especial, which servers two functions. First, “的 (de)”, marked as “de1”, was a boundary of two translation units and should be excluded from the two translation units, such as the “的” in the phrase “本发明的实施方式”, which consist two translation units “本发明”and “实施方式”. “的 2”; second,“的(de)”, marked as “de2” , is an inner conjunction of a translation unit, such as the “的” in the phrase “简明的装置”.","Here we focuses on “de1” and should distinguish it from “de2”. Based on the studying of the “的(de)”,we discovered some language rules from authentic contexts: “de2” were often behind of adjective, quantifier, verb and pronoun. In view of the cost and practicability, “de2”can be eliminated more easily.  prepositions","Preposition is one of Chinese functional words which have a complex function, involving various factors, such as “在(zai),根据(gen ju),作 为(zuo wei)”etc. For example,  localizers","There is a special grammatical method in Chinese language—the words of locality which represent pure directions, such as “上(on),中(in), 外(outside)”.  others","Some time nouns, such as “时(when)”and some auxiliary words, such as “而言(er yan)”.","Some prepositions and some localizers work hand in hand, such as “当......时”, “在......中”, “对......而言”etc.","The prepositions and localizers always worked with “de1”, for example, for Chinese NP “ 一种或多种作为湿润剂的醇类”,the preposition “作为” and structural particle “de1” could partition it into three translation units, for Chinese NP “ 通 常 运 转 时 的 气 体 压 力 ”, the localizer “时”and structural particle “de1” could partition it into two translation units.","From the above analysis we could see structural particle “ 的 (de)”, prepositions, localizers and others could be outer boundaries words for recognize the translation units.","2.1.2 Inner Characteristics","In Chinese NPs, the NPs may modify the NPs without any prepositions, localizers and structural particle, but not in English NPs.","This section explores some laws at the beginning word and the end word of translation units in Chinese-English translation. 2.1.2.1 Left Characteristics Chinese and English belong to two different 77  language families, in most cases, the source language cannot correspond to the target language well. However, the internal components of translation units shared some characters in common as the result of linguistic universality and identity of human thinking form.","By comparing the translation units, we can obtain some features of the beginning of translation units, which can be some implicit boundaries of two translation units.  demonstrative pronoun","In English NPs, the translation units also can be obtained by the definite articles and demonstrative pronoun. In Chinese NPs, the translation units also can be obtained by demonstrative pronoun. For example, the word “这些(these)” is demonstrative pronoun in translation unit“这些业务(these services)”  quantitative phrases","In Chinese NPs, the translation units could not obtained by indefinite articles and quantitative phrases. For example, the Chinese phases “一个,一种” and so on correspond to the English words “a, an, one” .","The Chinese words “第一, 第二, 第三, 第 四 ” correspond to the English words “first, second, third, fourth”.  adjectives An adjective usually modifies the noun. The difference of Chinese and English exists in many ways such as morphological structure and word-formation which leads to the different words for a semantic feature between Chinese and English. Some adjectives, past participles, present participles in English were expressed in phase in Chinese.  degree adverbs","The English adjective “notable” in translation unit “notable features” which are unique for English, thus appropriate version cannot find in Chinese vocabulary and expressed in phases “很显著” in translation unit “很显著的特点”, wherein “很” is a degree adverb. There are many degree adverbs in Chinese, for example \" 很(very), 非常(extremely), 十分(very much), 特别(specially), 极 (too),(little), 更 (more), 较 (better),比较(better), 最(best)\" etc.  time adverbs","The past participle “coated” in translation unit “coated tank” which are unique for English, thus appropriate version cannot find in Chinese vocabulary and expressed in phases “已涂覆” in translation unit “已涂覆罐”, wherein “已” is a time adverb. There are many time adverbs in Chinese, for example \" 已经(already), 曾经 (once), 早已(already), 刚刚(just now), 正 (be being),正在(be being),就(be going to),就要(be going to),将(be going to),将要(be going to),曾 (once),刚(just now),才(already),在(be being)\" etc.  negative adverbs","The English adjective negative prefixes, such as “negative, opposite, and reverse” etc, corresponds to the negative adverbial words “不 (un-),非(un-),没(dis-),没有(dis-),不用(un-),未 (dis-)”etc.  others","The “resulting” in translation unit “resulting decoded” which are unique for English, thus appropriate version cannot find in Chinese vocabulary and expressed in phases “经解码” in translation unit “经解码语音”.","The past participle “refrigerated” in translation unit “refrigerated substances” which are unique for English, thus appropriate version cannot find in Chinese vocabulary and expressed in phases “被制冷” in translation unit “被制冷物质”, wherein “被” is an auxiliary word. There are many auxiliary words in Chinese, such as “所(suo)” etc.","The English adjective “movable” in translation unit “rotatable structure” which are unique for English, thus appropriate version cannot find in Chinese vocabulary and expressed in phases “可旋转” in translation unit “可旋转结 构”.","2.1.2.1 Right Characteristics  Noun","In general, the end of a translation unit in Chinese patent was a noun.  number words","The number words consist of the numbers from 0 to 9 and were labels related to the new inventions. Huge numbers of number words could not enter the knowledge base and were generated dynamically as NUM when knowledge 78  base was loaded.  letter words","The letter words consist of numbers from 0 to 9 and 26 English letters. As with the number words, Huge numbers of number words could not enter the knowledge base and were generated dynamically as SPN when knowledge base was loaded.  auxiliary word “等(Deng)”","The auxiliary word “等(Deng)” Displays the enumeration entry.","As can be seen above, although Chinese does not have much overt morphology, it still distinguishes a translation unit from another by lexical devices.","When they were not outer boundary words in one continuous string, we used demonstrative pronoun, degree adverb, quantitative phrase, adjective, time adverbs, negative adverbs and others as the left boundary words to partition the string into two translation units utilizing contextual clues such as right characteristics. See table 1 for examples.","When they were not outer boundary words in one continuous string, we used number words, letter words, auxiliary word “等(Deng)” as the right boundary words to partition the string into two translation units.See table 2 for examples. Table1.The left boundary words and examples Table 2.The right boundary words and examples Right Boundary Words Examples","number words (水箱 300)(底部组件 303) ->(a base assembly 303)( for the tank 300)","letter words (主体部 400a)(膛)-> (the bore )of (the host section 400a)","等(deng) (牵引电动机等) (负载装置)->(a load device)( such as the traction motor)","Taken together, the boundary words have two types: 1) The out boundary words ,such as “的(de)” , propositions and locatives; 2) The inner boundary words, which include left boundary words and right boundary words. The left boundary words lie in the first word or phrase in a translation unit and the right boundary words lie in the last word. 2.1 Reordering","Once the translation units had been recognized, a new process called reordering can be applied to them.","This part compared and analyzed the differences in the orders of Chinese-English NPs so as to find out the law and develop a strategy on how to translate the complicated Chinese NPs to English effectively.","According to the boundary words above, we found that there are three types of translation units:  PPs","PPs with a preposition, such as “根据该形式” NP “ 根 据 该 形 式 的 模 具 ”, PPs with a preposition and a localizer, such as “在外模具部 件 601 和管子 400 外表面之间” in NP “在外模 具部件 601 和管子 400 外表面之间的界面”  LPs","LPs are unique to Chinese, such as “主体 上” in NP“主体上的主要压力”, Left Boundary Words Examples demonstrative pronoun (如权利要求 5)(所述的方法)->(the method) (according to claim 5) degree adverb (这项发明)(非常显著地一个特点)->(a very significant feature) of (this","invention) quantitative phrase (这种丙烯酸树脂)(一个来源)->(one suitable source) of (these acrylic","acrylate resins) adjective (支撑表面)(可能的总体压力)->(the possible total fluid pressure)of(a","support surface) time adverb (该容器)(已经清洗的表面)-> (the cleaned surface) of (the containers) negative adverb (取向膜) (未拉伸的酰化纤维素膜)-> (unstretched cellulose acylate","films) of (Orientation film) others (该工件)(被照射区)-> (the irradiated region) of (the work) 79   NPs","It could be one or more word, such as “/详视 图/(a detailed view), /所述/局部/缩放/估算/器 /( said local scale estimator)” and could include a “de2” , such as 大部分常规的交通工具布线系 统(most conventional vehicle wiring systems)” .  NP_Bs","NP_Bs is unique to Chinese. It could be adjectives, pronouns, numerals and quantitative phrases in special position, such as “一些” which could occur in the NP “一些基于环保溶剂的清 洗剂” which consist of three translation units “一些”, “基于环保溶剂” and “清洗剂”. The Chinese NPs consist of NPs, PPs, LPs and NP_Bs; otherwise, the English NPs consist of NPs and PPs only.","The Chinese and English NPs share some characters in common:1) the NPs consist of PPs and NPs, 2) the PPs could not be head translation units, 3) the NPs must be the head translation units.","However, the position and order between the NPs and PPs in Chinese were different from English as the result of different culture and tradition, especially, the NP_Bs, LPS are unique for Chinese NPs. The primary dissimilarity is that the head translation unit must locate in the end and others translation units such as NPs, PPs and LPs must be modifiers to some extent, otherwise, in English, the beginning translation unit is the head translation unit and followed by other PPs as modifiers.","Based on aligned Chinese-English NP-pairs from 15 Patent documents, this paper compared the differences in orders of Chinese-English NPs and analyzed types of translation units so as to find out the laws in translating Chinese NPs to English. For Chinese NPs, the PPs and LPs shared same function, so we use PPs for PPs and LPs.","2.1.1 Chinese NPs with two translation units","All combinations and the structure relations about two translation units can be listed in table 2, and we can see that in combinations of “NP1 NP2”, the NP1 or NP2 were the NPs and the NP1 must modify NP2; in combinations of “PP NP”, the NP must be the NPs and PP must modify the NP.","For the PPs and LPs, the prepositions were before the NPs and the locatives were behind the NPs, but the PPs or LPs could be moved as a whole. In table 2, we can see that there only one reordering way for the Chinese NPs with two translation units and b).","All structure relations between two translation units occur in Chinese, and we can find some examples to illustrate our reduction were right in table 3.","Table3: Chinese and English orders of NPs with two translation units Order in Chinese Order in English","Combinations Structure Relations","a) NP1 NP21 NP1 NP2 NP2 NP1","b) PP2 NP PP NP NP PP","Table4: examples of orders of Chinese and English NPs with two translation units","Chinese Orders -> English orders NP1 NP2-> NP2 NP1 ( 模 制 工 艺 ) 的 ( 操 作 参 数 )->the operating parameters of the molding process PP NP -> NP PP (在前面实施方案中)(所述的相同类型的聚合 材料)-> the same types of polymeric material in the earlier embodiment","2.1.2 Chinese NPs with three translation units","We can list all combinations and the structure relations about three translation units in the Chinese NPs.
