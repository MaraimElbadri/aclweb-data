Technology is the application of knowledge to practical pursuits. Information relevant to technology is the subject of various types of documents, including: scholarly publications (journals, conference proceedings, abstracts, grant applications, textbooks); legal documents (patents, contracts, legislation); and more public venues (magazines, webpages, blogs, financial reports). Interest in the automatic classification of technical documents has recently been growing and Natural Language Processing is a major component of such classification systems. Presented at this workshop were six regular papers and two invited talks on various topics connected to the linguistic analysis of technical language including work on terminology, citations, Chinese-English Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, event extraction, literary analysis, named entity recognition, among other topics. Technical domains investigated included both patents and journal articles. We thank the invited speakers, program committee, authors, Coling organizers and participants for a successful workshop.
