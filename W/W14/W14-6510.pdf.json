The writing system used in these publications was controversial as it did not made the accurate fixation of the tonal contour of words. At present the dictionary of Mwan has 2247 entries, the dictionary is also used for automatic interlinearization of Mwan texts. The number of the glossed texts is actually 48 (38000 words).

According to Ethnologue-14, there were about 20000 ethnic Mwan (Ethnologue code: moa ISO 639-3). Typologically, Mwan can be characterized by its complex tonology. There are three level tones and two contour tones. A significant part of the inflectional morphology is tonal. Derivational morphology is based on compounding. One of the most interesting, from typological viewpoint, features of the language is a great number of pronominal series marked for polarity, focus and grammatical relations. The first serious work on Mwan was the article of M. Bolli and E. Flick that presentes a description of the Mwan phonology (Bolli, Flick, 1978). Later the work on Mwan was carried out by C. Fleming (Fleming, 1995) and A. YegbÃ© (YegbÃ©, 200 2). Mwan was never an officially written language, it was never used in mass media. Only three books were ever published in Mwan; a Syllabaire (ZogbÃ© DjÃ̈1998), a book of f olk tales containing 20 texts (GogbÃ© 2001) and a recently accomplished translation of the New Testament (Bible 2006). My work on the Mwan language was carried out in the frames of the project of creating dictionaries, grammars and text corpora for the South Mande languages (Perekhvalskaya, 2004, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013). In this presentation I will limit to the dictionary and the Mwan text corpus. I used the Toolbox software, and I will discuss the problems which I faced in the course of my work."]},{"title":"2 Writing system","paragraphs":["Computer orientated linguistic work needs a consistent and single-valued writing system. It can probably be achieved only in the case when the writing system of a language is strictly codified as, for instance, the French or English orthography or if it is used only for linguistic purposes by one linguists. Languages with a resent writing tradition as a rule suffer from: - the lack of coordination between those who write; in extreme cases every one may use his/her own system of writing; - the lack of consistency: one and the same word may be written down differently in the limits of the same text, sometimes on the same page; - over-distinction or under-distinction of segmental or suprasegmental relevant units; - dialect or idiolect variation. It is necessary to elaborate an appropriate writing system which would be basic for the automatic text processing. This system must be consistent and, probably (but not obligatory), based on the existing orthography sometimes with some modification. The conversion of the existing texts into texts suitable for automatic processing may be automatic only if the correlation between their writing systems is consistent, otherwise it has to be done manually. In my Mwan corpus, I use the writing system that was created on the basis of the existing alphabet based on the Latin script proposed by Margrit Bolli and Eva Flick in 2000 in the frames of the SIL International activities. The main defect of the Bolli and FlickÂ’s representation of the Mwan sound system is the tone marking. They denoted tones with punctuation marks (apostrophe, hyphen, equal sign). For one vowel words High tone was marked by the apostrophe, Low tone by the hyphen, Middle tone by the absence of a sign, the equal sign marked the modulated tone: e.g. Â‘fɛ /fɛ́/ Â‘houseÂ’; ye /yē/ Â‘to seeÂ’; -yi /yÃ¬/ Â‘waterÂ’. For two-vowel words, if the two vowe ls bear the same tone, only the tone of the first vowel was marked: Â‘peni /pÃ©nı ̰́ / Â‘stingÂ’; bie /bīē/ Â‘elephantÂ’; -vakɔ /vÃk ɔ̀/ Â‘sugar caneÂ’. If the first vowel bears Low tone, and the second is Â“higherÂ” (High or Middle), the end of the word is labeled with the apostrophe: -gbaanÂ’ /gba̰ ̀ā̰ / Â‘dogÂ’; -sooÂ’ /sÃ2Ã3/ Â‘horseÂ’. If the tone of the first vowel is H igh, and the tone of second vowel is Â“lowerÂ” (Low or Middle), the end of the word is marked by the hyphen: Â‘pubɔ- /pÃob ɔ̄ / Â‘to greetÂ’; Â‘kpata- /kpÃ¡tÃ/ Â‘rackÂ’. The Middle tone on the first vowel is not marked, the High tone of the second vowel is denoted with the apostrophe, the Low tone of the second vowel being denoted with the hyphen: kɔnɛÂ’ /kɔ̄ nɛ̰ ́/ Â‘bugÂ’; nina- /nı̰̄ nà̰ / Â‘to returnÂ’. For three-vowel and more complex words only the tone of the initial vowel is denoted: -amasrɔyi /Ãma ̰̄ srɔ̀yÃ/ Â‘becauseÂ’; laanima /lāānı̰́ mā̰ / Â‘upwardsÂ’; Â‘ŋkɛna [ŋ́ kɛ̀nà̰ ] Â‘good morningÂ’. This system of tone marking makes it impossible to record accurately the tone contour of the word and therefore can not be used for the language documentation. In my project the tones are consistently marked: the Low tone is indicated by Â“gravisÂ”, the High tone by the sign Â“acute accentÂ”, the Middle tone is denoted by the macron, the sign Â“circumflexÂ” is used for rare cases when the modulated HL (v́ v̀ ) tone is beard by a short vowel. Nasalized syllables are marked by the tilde under the vowel: bīē [bīē] Â‘elephantÂ’, gbà̰ ā̰ /gba̰ ā̰ / Â‘dogÂ’, kɔ̄ nɛ̰́ /kɔ̄ nɛ̰́ / Â‘bugÂ’, pÃob ɔ̄ /pÃob ɔ̄ / Â‘to greetÂ’."]},{"title":"[TALAF-O.10] 180 3 Dictionary","paragraphs":["The dictionary for the automatic language processing may be just auxiliary, containing only necessary fields : lemma, alternative variants, tags and glosses. However, it must contain not only lexemes of the language but also bound morphemes with all their free or context depending variants. In the frames of my project, the Mwan dictionary created on the basis of the Toolbox software is at the same time a full dictionary of the language and the auxiliary dictionary for interlinearization. It contains fields of a full Mwan-French-English-Russian dictionary and also fields for glosses (in three languages). An export made from the Toolbox (Dictionnaire mwan-franÃ§ais) is available on line http://mandelang.kunstkamera.ru/files/mandelang/introd_mwan.pdf; http://mandelang.kunstkamera.ru/files/mandelang/mwan_dic.pdf  FIGURE 1 : Page of the Mwan-French-English-Russian Dictionary At present, the Mwan dictionary contains 2247 entries : words and bound morphemes. The lemma (the field \\le) is given in scientific orthography; the field \\leor copies the lemma in practical writing. No transcription is given as the scientific notation makes it possible to establish unambiguously the phonemic structure of the word. Verbs are given as roots in the field \\le, which is used for interlinearization and in nominalized from (with the suffix -le) in the field \\leor which is intended for the native speakers of Mwan. The dictionary contains also bound morphemes (inflectional or derivational), which are needed for the morphological analyzer. The field \\a contains all variants, segmental and tonal, free and contextual. When the variant form is an indissoluble unit, it is unscrambled in the field u\\. Example : there is a tonal morpheme in Mwan. The Middle tone marks the Habitual aspect in verb. So the dictionary contains the morpheme coded as -= and glossed HAB. Habitual verbs forms are unscrambled (the field \\u) as having the morpheme -= (see Figure 2.)  FIGURE 2 : Presentation of a tonal morpheme Every entry contains all the grammatical information concerning the corresponding lexeme or morpheme : 1) word class (\\ps); 2) morphonological, free or dialect variants (\\a); 3) information on the inflectional type (\\mrph); 4) irregular forms"]},{"title":"[TALAF-O.10] 181","paragraphs":["(\\gre); 5) stylistic usage (\\use). The idiomatic usages are given inside the corresponding entry. Many entries are provided with illustrative examples. For polysemous words definitions, explanations, examples and idiomatic expressions are given for each value."]},{"title":"3 Interlinearization","paragraphs":["The interlinearization of texts is made in the frames of the Toolbox software. The line \\mb is produced automatically by the morphological analyzer with the help of the morphemic dictionary. Each morpheme is glossed (in three languages). If there are two or more possibilities of the morpheme analysis, the homonymy is removed manually (see the box in Fig. 3.)  FIGURE 3 : P In some cases the word frequency is taken into account. Homonyms of frequent lexemes or morphemes which are much rarer, are derived from the morphemic search. They are listed under the field \\lx. If necessary, they are moved back to the field \\le (manually). So, the dictionary, in fact, contains a part which is NOT used for interlinearization (Passive words). However, it is possible to move them to the Active part when necessary. Examples of these Â“removedÂ” homonyms: dɔ̄ ɔ̄ Â‘winged termiteÂ’, homonym for dɔ̄ ɔ̄ Â‘thatÂ’ (marker of indirect speech); yÃÃ Â‘prickly yamÂ’, homonym for yÃÃ Â‘was, were (Perfective of the copula Ã2 ), yÃÃ Â‘to roast, to grillÂ’. Another example is taken from my Udihe Corpus project1",". The dictionary of this language contains three homonyms: Â‘ai Â‘ai Â‘elder brotherÂ’, Â‘vodka, strong spiritÂ’ and Â‘ai Â‘buttocksÂ’. As the majority of the available Udihe texts are folk tales, so Â‘elder brotherÂ’ is a very frequent lexeme, Â‘vodkaÂ’ is much less frequent, and Â‘buttocksÂ’ is extremely rare. Therefore, the last two units are placed to the Passive part of the dictionary. Sometimes such homonymy of unequal value can be solved by taking in consideration the context. E.g. in Udihe Corpus there two homonym morphemes: -ni Â‘marker of the 3 SgÂ’ and -ni Â‘a rare variant the Dative case markerÂ’. The variant of the Dative marker appears only in postpositions and only before the markers of person/number (postpositions are a specific class of nouns). I put the sequences like -nini as a separate entry in the dictionary without a gloss but with the field u\\ which Â“explainsÂ” the form as -du Â‘DATÂ’ and -ni Â‘3SGÂ’ (Fig. 4).          1 I am also engaged into the corpus project of Udihe which is not an African language. However, the experience obtained while making the corpus of a small mainly unwritten language may also be useful for preparing corpora of an African language.  FIGURE 4 : P"]},{"title":"[TALAF-O.10] 182","paragraphs":["Words belonging to different word classes (which have different tags in the field \\ps) are given as different entries, even if the etymological link between them is obvious, e.g. : Mwan kɔ̀ ɔ̀ Â‘handÂ’ (noun) and kɔ̀ ɔ̀ Â‘withÂ’, Â‘atÂ’, Â‘in the hands ofÂ’ (postposition); Udihe: tuəʒə Â‘winter houseÂ’, tuəʒə Â‘to spend the winter, to hibernateÂ’. Glosses. From the semantic point of view glosses do not provide the true translation, as they are conventional. One and the same gloss is ascribed to all the values of a polysemous word, including, for instance, valence changing p-labile verbs; e.g. Mwan: the verb wlā has the following meanings: 1) Â‘to arriveÂ’, Â‘to come inÂ’; 2) to enter (school), to join (organization); to convert oneself (to religion); 3) Â‘to make comeÂ’, Â‘to make enterÂ’; 4) to put on (of hats). The unique gloss is enter. The noun wī denotes: 1) animal (general word); 2) meat; the gloss is meat. Obviously, a gloss may be more or less opportune in different contexts. In Udihe, the word mafa has the following main meanings: 1) old man; 2) husband; 3) bear. All the three words are extremely frequent in folk tales and sometimes appear in the same text, like Â“The bear said to the girl: I have found you a husbandÂ”. It would be really misleading to use the same gloss for all the three meanings which seem nevertheless the values of the same word (at least etymologically). They can be given as separate entries in the dictionary. It would multiply variants in the ambiguity selection box. It is possible to ascribe more than one gloss to the same entry (Figure 5)  In this case the Ambiguity selection box will give only one possibility: mafa, which will significantly reduce the number variants; the selection between meanings will be maid in the next step. The free translation is also given in three languages."]},{"title":"4 Corpus of the glossified texts 4.1. Composition of the Corpus","paragraphs":["At present, the number of interlinearized Mwan texts is 48, the total number of words is about 38000. The texts belong to the following genres : - oral transcribed texts : - folk tales; - tales (including tales of witchcraft); - oral history; - dialogues; - texts taken from published sources: - folk tales; - tales (including funny stories); - proverbs; FIGURE 5 : Doubling (trebling) of a gloss"]},{"title":"[TALAF-O.10] 183 ","paragraphs":["- translations from French. Oral texts, especially dialogues, contain a large amount of incomplete sentences, hesitation pauses, discursive markers and loans from other languages, mainly, from French and Jula. All these elements have to be present in the dictionary (or in a supplementary dictionary) otherwise the automatic processing would be impossible. Oral texts present the following problems: - unfinished or illegibly pronounced words; - discursive markers and expletive words; - words from other languages, especially when recording dialogues with code-switching. Written texts, as a rule, use the inconsistent orthography: - compositions of two or more roots may be written as one solid word and as two or three words in the frames of one and the same text; - suffixes are written together with the root or separately; - imprecise tone marking. Both types of texts contain a lot of non generally known toponyms and anthroponyms. As Toolbox makes it possible to use more than one dictionary for interlinearization, all anomalous segmental units may be grouped in a Supplementary dictionary. It is possible to make several supplementary dictionaries: for anthroponyms, for non adopted words of the dominant language, for some sort of rubbish (incomplete words, pauses of hesitation etc). As for the inconsistency in written texts, the original version should be presented in a separate field (\\txor) which is not used in automatic processing. The field \\tx has to be filled with the uniformly written words."]},{"title":"4.2. Corpus search","paragraphs":["The interlinearised, annotated and translated text can be easily transferred into an Internet accessible interface with the possibility of searching (for instance, using the NoSketchEngine software platform). At present it was done for the Udihe project. As an illustration I present two concordances for the discussed above word mafa Â‘bear, husband, old manÂ’ 1) as a single word mafa (Figure 6) and 2) mafa-ni with the marker of 3SG(Figure 6):  FIGURE 6 : Results of the search for mafa-ni"]},{"title":"[TALAF-O.10] 184 ","paragraphs":["The obtained results show that these words are not complete homonyms: mafa Â‘bearÂ’ does not attach the personal marker; mafa Â‘husband, old manÂ’ is always used with the personal marker > mafa-ni which is logical, as mafa-ni Â‘husbandÂ’ is a kinship term. This small demonstration shows great possibilities of language corpora for linguistic research. In theory, any Udihe noun can attach the 3 Sg suffix, so the distinction between these two words was not clear. The research based on the massive data showed that the words mafa Â‘bearÂ’ and mafa-ni Â‘old manÂ’, Â‘husbandÂ’ differ by their grammatical behaviour, thus, they probably should be regarded not as different meanings of the same word but as different words."]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":["The demonstrated above algorithm of creating language coropora may be represented as follows: transcription of an oral text digitizing of a printed text | unifirm written representation | creating a Toolbox project | interlinearisation with Toolbox | concerting the interlinearized texts into a linguistic corpus using the NoSketchEngine software platform.
