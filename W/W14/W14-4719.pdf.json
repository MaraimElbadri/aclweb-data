The inadequacy of lexical coverage of multiword expressions is one of the serious issues in machine translation and automatic MT evaluation; there are simply too many forms to enumerate explicitly within the lexicon. Automatic MT evaluation has driven machine translation research for a decade and a half, but until recently little has been done to use lexical semantics as the main foundation for MT metrics. Common surface-form oriented metrics like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST (Doddington, 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), CDER (Leusch et al., 2006), WER (Nießen et al., 2000), and TER (Snover et al., 2006) do not explicitly reflect semantic similarity between the reference and machine translations. Several large scale meta-evaluations (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Koehn and Monz, 2006) have in fact reported that BLEU significantly disagrees with human judgments of translation adequacy.","Recently, the MEANT semantic frame based MT evaluation metrics (Lo and Wu, 2011a, 2012; Lo et al., 2012; Lo and Wu, 2013b), have instead directly couched MT evaluation in the more cognitive terms of semantic frames, by measuring the degree to which the basic event structure is preserved by translation— the “who did what to whom, for whom, when, where, how and why” (Pradhan et al., 2004)—emphasizing that a good translation is one that can successfully be understood by a human. Across a variety of language pairs and genres, MEANT was shown to correlate better with human adequacy judgment than both n-gram based MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST (Doddington, 2002), and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), as well as edit-distance based metrics such as CDER (Leusch et al., 2006), WER (Nießen et al., 2000), and TER (Snover et al., 2006) when evaluating MT output (Lo and Wu, 2011a, 2012; Lo et al., 2012; Lo and Wu, 2013b; Macháček and Bojar, 2013). Furthermore, tuning the parameters of MT systems with MEANT instead of BLEU or TER robustly improves translation","This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Whereas HMEANT uses human annotation, the automatic versions of MEANT instead replace humans with automatic SRL and alignment algorithms. MEANT typically outperforms BLEU, NIST, METEOR, WER, CDER and TER in correlation with human adequacy judgment, and is relatively easy to port to other languages, requiring only an automatic semantic parser and a monolingual corpus of the output language, which is used to gauge lexical similarity between the semantic role fillers of the reference and translation. More precisely, MEANT computes scores as follows:","1. Apply an automatic shallow semantic parser to both the references and MT output. (Figure 1 shows examples of automatic shallow semantic parses on both reference and MT.)","2. Apply the maximum weighted bipartite matching algorithm to align the semantic frames between the references and MT output according to the lexical similarities of the predicates.","3.

(2012)","and Tumuluru et al. (2012). 3.1 Bag of words (geometric mean)","The original MEANT approaches employed standard a bag-of-words strategy for lexical association.

Especially when considering","semantic MT metrics, ITGs would seem to be a natural strategy for multiword expression association for","several cognitively motivated reasons, having to do with language universal properties of cross-linguistic","semantic frame structure. To begin with, it is quite natural to think of sentences as having been generated from an abstract concept","using a rewriting system: a stochastic grammar predicts how frequently any particular realization of the","abstract concept will be generated. The bilingual analogy is a transduction grammar generating a pair","of possible realizations of the same underlying concept. Stochastic transduction grammars predict how","frequently a particular pair of realizations will be generated, and thus represent a good way to evaluate","how well a pair of sentences correspond to each other. The particular class of transduction grammars known as ITGs tackle the problem that the (bi)parsing","complexity for general syntax-directed transductions (Aho and Ullman, 1972) is exponential. By","constraining a syntax-directed transduction grammar to allow only monotonic straight and inverted","reorderings, or equivalently permitting only binary or ternary rank rules, it is possible to isolate the low","end of that hierarchy into a single equivalence class of inversion transductions. ITGs are guaranteed to","have a two-normal form similar to context-free grammars, and can be biparsed in polynomial time and","space (O ( n6) time and O ( n4) space). It is also possible to do approximate biparsing in O ( n3)","time","(Saers et al., 2009). These polynomial complexities makes it feasible to estimate the parameters of an","ITG using standard machine learning techniques such as expectation maximization (Wu, 1995b) . At the same time, inversion transductions have also been directly shown to be more than sufficient","to account for the reordering that occur within semantic frame alternations (Addanki et al., 2012). This","language universal property has an evolutionary explanation in terms of computational efficiency and","cognitive load for language learnability and interpretability (Wu, 2014). ITGs are thus an appealing alternative for evaluating the possible links between both semantic role","fillers in different languages as well as the predicates, and how these parts fit together to form entire","semantic frames. We believe that ITGs are not only capable of generating the desired structural corre-","spondences between the semantic structures of two languages, but also provide meaningful constraints","to prevent alignments from wandering off in the wrong direction. Following this reasoning, alternate definitions of si,pred and si,j can be constructed in terms of brack-","eting ITGs (also known as BITGs or BTGs) which are ITGs containing only a single non-differentiated 147 nonterminal category (Wu, 1995a). The idea is to attack a potential weakness of the foregoing three lexical association strategies, namely that word/token alignments between the reference and machine translations are severely underconstrained. No bijectivity or permutation restrictions are applied, even between compositional segments where this should be natural. This can cause multiword expressions of semantic role fillers to be matched even when they should not be. In contrast, using a bracketing inversion transduction grammar can potentially better constrain permissible token alignment patterns between aligned role filler phrases. Figure 2 illustrates how the ITG constraints are consistent with the needed permutations between semantic role fillers across the reference and machine translations for a sample sentence from the evaluation data.","In this approach, both alignment and scoring are performed utilizing a length-normalized weighted BITG (Wu, 1997; Zens and Ney, 2003; Saers and Wu, 2009; Addanki et al., 2012). We define si,pred and si,j as follows. si,pred = lg−1   lg","( P","( A ∗ ⇒ ei,pred/fi,pred|G )) max(| ei,pred |, | fi,pred |)   si,j = lg−1   lg","( P","( A ∗ ⇒ ei,j/fi,j|G)) max(| ei,j |, | fi,j |)   where","G ≡ ⟨{A} , W0",", W1",", R, A⟩","R ≡ {A → [AA] , A → ⟨AA⟩, A → e/f}","p ([AA] |A) = p (⟨AA⟩|A) = 1 p (e/f|A) = s(e, f) Here G is a bracketing ITG whose only nonterminal is A, and R is a set of transduction rules with e ∈ W0","∪ {ε} denoting a token in the MT output (or the null token) and f ∈ W1","∪ {ε} denoting a token in the reference translation (or the null token). The rule probability (or more accurately, rule weight) function p is set to be 1 for structural transduction rules, and for lexical transduction rules it is defined by MEANT’s lexical similarity measure on English Gigaword context vectors. To calculate the inside probability (or more accurately, inside score) of a pair of segments, P","( A ∗ ⇒ e/f|G )",", we use the algorithm described in Saers et al. (2009). Given this, si,pred and si,j now represent the length normalized BITG parse scores of the predicates and role fillers of the arguments of type j between the reference and machine translations."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["In this section we discuss experiments comparing the four alternative lexical access preference and constraint strategies. 4.1 Experimental setup We compared using the DARPA GALE P2.5 Chinese-English translation test set, as used in Lo and","Wu (2011a). The corpus includes the Chinese input sentences, each accompanied by an English reference","translation and three participating state-of-the-art MT systems’ output. We computed sentence-level correlations following the benchmark assessment procedure used by","WMT and NIST MetricsMaTr (Callison-Burch et al., 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012; Macháček and Bojar,","2013), which use Kendall’s τ correlation coefficient, to evaluate the correlation of evaluation metrics","against human judgment on ranking the translation adequacy of the three systems’ output. A higher","value for Kendall’s τ indicates more similarity to the human adequacy rankings by the evaluation met-","rics. The range of possible values of Kendall’s τ correlation coefficient is [-1, 1], where 1 means the 148 Table 1: Sentence-level correlation with human adequacy judgements on different partitions of GALE P2.5 data. For reference, the human HMEANT upper bound is 0.53—so the fully automatic ITG based MEANT approximation is not far from closing the gap.","Kendall correlation MEANT + ITG based 0.51 MEANT + maximum alignment (f-score) 0.48 MEANT + maximum alignment (average of precision & recall) 0.46 MEANT + bag of words (geometric mean) 0.38 NIST 0.29 METEOR 0.20 BLEU 0.20 TER 0.20 PER 0.20 CDER 0.12 WER 0.10 systems are ranked in the same order as the human judgment by the evaluation metric; and -1 means the systems are ranked in the reverse order as human judgment by the evaluation metric.","For both reference and machine translations, the ASSERT (Pradhan et al., 2004) semantic role labeler was used to automatically predict semantic parses. 4.2 Results and discussion","The sentence-level correlations in Table 1 show that the ITG based strategy outperforms other automatic metrics in correlation with human adequacy judgment. Note that this was achieved with no tuning whatsoever of the rule weights (suggesting that the performance could be further improved in the future by slightly optimizing the ITG weights).","The ITG based strategy shows 3 points improvement over the next best strategy, which is maximal alignment under f-score aggregation. The ITG based approach produces much higher HAJ correlations than any of the other metrics.","In fact, the ITG based strategy even comes within a few points of the human upper bound benchmark HAJ correlations computed using the human labeled semantic frames and alignments used in the HMEANT.","Data analysis reveals two reasons that the ITG based strategy correlates with human adequacy judgement more closely than the other approaches. First, BITG constraints indeed provide more accurate phrasal similarity aggregation, compared to the naive bag-of-words based heuristics. Similar results have been observed while trying to estimate word alignment probabilities where BITG constraints outperformed alignments from GIZA++ (Saers and Wu, 2009). Secondly, the permutation and bijectivity constraints enforced by the ITG provide better leverage to reject token alignments when they are not appropriate, compared with the maximal alignment approach which tends to be rather promiscuous. The ITG tends whenever appropriate to accept clean, sparse alignments for role fillers, prefering to leave tokens unaligned instead of aligning them anyway as the other strategies tend to do. Note that it is not simply a matter of lowering thresholds for accepting token alignments: Tumuluru et al. (2012) showed that the competitive linking approach (Melamed, 1996) does not work as well as the strategies considered in this paper, whereas the ITG appears to be selective about the token alignments in a manner that better fits the semantic structure."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have compared four alternative lexical access strategies for aggregation, preferences, and constraints in scoring multiword expression associations that are far too numerous to be explicitly enumerated in lexicons, within the context of semantic frame based machine translation evaluation: bag-of-words, 149 Figure 2: An example of aligning automatic shallow semantic parses under ITGs, visualized using both biparse tree and alignment matrix depictions, for the Chinese input sentence 层级的减少有利于提高检查 监督工作的效率。 Both the reference and machine translations are parsed using automatic English SRL.

Controlled experiments within the MEANT semantic MT evaluation framework shows that the cognitively motivated ITG based strategy achieves significantly higher correlation with human adequacy judgments of MT output quality than the more typically used lexical association approaches. The results show how to improve upon previous research showing that MEANT’s explicit use of semantic frames leads to state-of-the-art automatic MT evaluation, by aligning and scoring semantic frames under a simple, consistent ITG that provides empirically informative permutation and bijectivity biases, instead of more naive maximal alignment or bag-of-words assumptions.","Cognitive studies of the lexicon are often described using intrinsic measures of quality. Our experiments complement this by situating the empirical comparisons within extrinsic real-world task-based performance measures.
