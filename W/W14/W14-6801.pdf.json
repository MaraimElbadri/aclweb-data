Such discourse structure is fundamental to document-level applications, such as text understanding, summarization, knowledge extraction and question-answering. In comparison with English, there are only a few studies on Chinese discourse analysis, due to the lack of appropriate theories to Chinese discourse structure representation and large-scale well-accepted corpora. In this talk, I will present a novel discourse structure representation scheme for Chinese, called Connectivedriven Dependency Tree (CDT), and describe our adventure in corpus annotation of the Chinese Discourse Treebank (CDTB) of 500 documents, using a top-down strategy to keep consistent with Chinese nativeâ€™s cognitive habit.
