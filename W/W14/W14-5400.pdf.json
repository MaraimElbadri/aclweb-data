It was the joint 3rd meeting of the EPSRC Network On Vision and Language and 1st technical meeting of the new European Network on Integrating Vision and Language which is funded as a European COST Action. The VL workshops have the general aims:","1. to provide a forum for reporting and discussing planned, ongoing and completed research that involves both language and vision; and","2. to enable NLP and computer vision researchers to meet, exchange ideas, expertise and technology, and form new research partnerships. As funding for the V&L EPSRC Network (EP/H018557) ends and funding for the iV&L Net European COST Action (IC1307) starts, the focus of the VL workshops will shift onto integration and joint modelling of language and vision. iV&L Net will take over the organisation of annual VL workshops for the next four years as the flagship workshop of this new COST Action.","The call for papers for VL’14 was issued in May 2014 and elicited a good number of high-quality submissions, each of which was peer-reviewed by three members of the programme committee. The interest in the workshop from leading NLP and computer vision researchers and the quality of submissions was high, so we aimed to be as inclusive as possible within the practical constraints of the workshop. In the end we accepted 14 submissions as long papers, and eight as short papers.","The resulting workshop programme packed a lot of exciting content into one day. We were delighted to be able to include in the programme a keynote presentation by Alex Jaimes of Yahoo! Inc., an internationally leading vision researcher. Our technical programme combined seven oral papers, seven long poster papers and seven short poster papers. Some thematic clusters emerged: combined text and image processing (Nguyen et al., Sakaki et al., Jones et al., Zhang et al., HaCohen-Kerner et al.), image description, annotation and labelling (Elliott, Liparas et al., Wang et al., Jokinen and Wilcock), data set creation (Weiland et al., Le et al., McGuinness et al.), situated dialogue (Summers-Stay et al., Schütte et al.), video analysis (Bhat and Olszewska, Shrestha et al.), aids for visually impaired people (Safi et al., Belz and Bharath), and visual analysis supported by text/speech features (Anbarjafari and Aabloo). The programme also included a discussion session on future directions for the VL community and workshops, including plans for shared task competitions.","We would like to thank all the people who have contributed to the organisation and delivery of this workshop: the authors who submitted such high quality papers; the programme committee for their prompt and effective reviewing; our keynote speaker, Alex Jaimes; the COLING 2014 organising committee, especially the workshops chairs, Jennifer Foster, Dan Gildea, and Tim Baldwin; the participants in the workshop; and future readers of these proceedings for your shared interest in this exciting new area of research.
