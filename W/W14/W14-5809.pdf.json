MRDs’ definitions provided robust and structured knowledge from which semantic relations were automatically extracted for linguistic studies (Markowitz et al., 1986) and linguistic resources development (Calzolari, 1988). Today the scenario has changed as corpora have become the main source for semantic knowledge acquisition. However, dictionaries are regaining some interest thanks to the availability of public domain dictionaries, especially Wiktionary.","In the present work, we describe a method to create a morphosemantic and morphological French lexicon from Wiktionary’s definitions. This type of large coverage resource is not available for almost all languages, with the exception of the CELEX database (Baayen et al., 1995) for English, German and Dutch, a paid resource distributed by the LDC.","The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reports related work on semantic and morphological acquisition from MRDs. In Section 3, we describe how we converted Wiktionnaire, the French language edition of Wiktionary, into a structured XML-tagged MRD which contains, among other things, definitions and morphological relations. In Section 4, we explain how we used Wiktionnaire’s morphological sections to create a lexicon of morphologically related words. The notion of morphological definitions and their automatic identification are introduced in Section 5. In Section 6, we show how these definitions enable us to acquire new derived words and enrich the initial lexicon. Finally, Section 7 describes an experiment where we semantically typed process nouns definitions."]},{"title":"2 Related work","paragraphs":["Semantic relations are usually acquired using corpora (Curran and Moens, 2002; van der Plas and Bouma, 2005; Heylen et al., 2008) but may also be acquired from MRDs. MRDs-based approaches are bound to the availability of such resources. However, for some languages including French, no such resource exists. Recent years have seen the development of large resources built automatically by aggregating and/or translating data originating from different sources. For example, Sagot and Fišer (2008) have built WOLF, “a free French Wordnet” and Navigli and Ponzetto (2010) BabelNet, a large multilingual semantic network.

Pierrel (2013), while criticizing these resources, describes the digitization process of the Trésor de la Langue Franca̧ise, a large printed French dictionary. The first impulse of this long-course reverse-engineering project is described in (Dendien, 1994) and resulted in the TLFi, a fine-grained XML-structured dictionary. Pierrel advocates mutualization, recommends resources sharing and underlines how the use of the TLFi would be relevant for NLP. Though we totally agree on this assertion, we deplore that the resource, being only available for manual use and not for download, prevents its use for NLP.","Crowdsourcing has recently renewed the field of lexical resources development. For example Lafourcade (2007) designed JeuxDeMots, a game with a purpose, to collect a great number of relations between words. Other works use the content of wikis produced by crowds of contributors. Initially in the shadow of Wikipedia, the use of Wiktionary tends to grow in NLP studies since its exploitation by Zesch et al. (2008). Its potential as an electronic lexicon was first studied by Navarro et al. (2009) for English and French. The authors leverage the dictionary to build a synonymy network and perform random walks to find missing links. Other works tackled data extraction: Anton Pérez et al. (2011) for instance, describe the integration of the Portuguese Wiktionary and Onto.PT; Sérasset (2012) built Dbnary, a multilingual network containing “easily extractable” entries. If the assessment of Wiktionary’s quality from a lexicographic point of view has not been done yet, Zesch and Gurevych (2010) have shown that lexical resources built by crowds lead to results comparable to those obtained with resources designed by professionals, when used to compute semantic relatedness of words. In Sajous et al. (2013a), we created an inflectional and phonological lexicon from Wiktionary and showed that its quality is comparable to those of reference lexicons, while the coverage is much wider.","Comparatively little effort has been reported in literature on the exploitation of semantic relations to automatically identify morphological relations. Schone and Jurafsky (2000) learn morphology with a method based on semantic similarity extracted by latent semantic analysis. Baroni et al. (2002) combine orthographic (string edit distances) and semantic similarity (words’ contextual information) in order to discover morphologically related words. Along the same line, Zweigenbaum and Grabar (2003) acquire semantic information from a medical corpus and use it to detect morphologically derived words. More recently, Hathout (2008) uses the TLFi to discover morphologically related words by combining orthographic and semantic similarity with formal analogy.","I another work, Pentheroudakis and Vanderwende (1993) present a method to automatically extract morphological relations from the definitions of MRDs. The authors automatically identify classes of morphologically related words by comparing the semantic information in the entry of the derivative with the information stored in the candidate base form. This effort shows the crucial importance and the potential of the MRDs’ definitions to acquire and discover morphological relationships of derived words."]},{"title":"3 Turning the French Wiktionary into a Machine-Readable Dictionary","paragraphs":["As mentioned is section 2, the quality of collaboratively constructed resources has already been assessed","and we will not debate further the legitimacy of leveraging crowdsourced data for NLP purpose. We give","below a brief description of Wiktionary1","and of the process of converting it into a structured resource.","Wiktionary is divided in language editions.

(2013b) and Sérasset (2012),","this loose encoding format makes it difficult to extract consistent data. One can choose to either restrict","the extraction to prototypical articles or design a fine-grained parser that collects the maximum of the","available information.

In our case, it enabled us to design an unprecedented large copylefted lexicon that has no equivalent for French.","The basic unit of Wiktionary’s articles is the word form: several words from different languages having the same word form occur in the same page (at the same URL). In such a page, a given language section may be divided in several parts of speech which may in turn split into several homonyms subsections. In the French Wiktionary, the course entry, for example, describes both the French and English lexemes. The French section splits into a noun section (une course ‘a run; a race’) and a section related to the inflected forms of the verb courser ‘to pursue’. The noun section distinguishes 11 senses that all have definitions illustrated by examples. An extract of the noun section’s wikicode is depicted in Figure 1. As can be seen, some wiki conventions are recurrent (e.g. double-brackets mark hyperlinks) and are easy to handle. Handling dynamic templates (marked by curly brackets) is more tricky. In definitions, they mark notes related to particular domains, registers, usages, geographic areas, languages, etc. In Figure 1, the pattern {{sport}} indicates that the second sense relates to the domain of sport ; the pattern {{vieilli|fr}} in the following definition denotes a dated usage ; the pattern{{figuré|fr}} in the last definition indicates a figurative one. We inventoried about 6,000 such templates and their aliases: for example, 4 patterns (abbreviated or full form, with or without ligature) signal the domain of enology: {{œnologie|fr}}, {{oenologie|fr}}, {{œnol|fr}} and {{oenol|fr}}. Unfortunately, the existence of such patterns does not prevent a contributor to directly write domain name in the page: several versions of “hardcoded domains” may be found, e.g. (oenologie) or (œnologie).","Inventorying all these variations enabled us: 1) to remove them from the definitions’ text and 2) to mark them in a formal way. Thus, one can decide to remove or keep, on demand, entries that are marked as rare or dated, build a sublexicon of a given domain, remove diatopic variations or investigate only these forms (e.g. words that are used only in Quebec), etc.","The variations observed in the definitions also occur in phonemic transcriptions, inflectional features, semantic relations, etc. We focus here only on the information used in sections 6 and 7: definitions and morphological relations. However, we parsed Wiktionnaire’s full content and extracted all kind of available information, handling the numerous variations that we observed to convert the online dictionary into a structured resource, that we called GLAWI.3","It contains more than 1.4 million inflected forms (about 190,000 lemmas) with their definitions, examples, lexicosemantic relations and translations, derived terms and phonemic transcriptions. A shortened extract resulting from the conversion of the noun section of course is depicted in Figure 2. As can be seen, GLAWI includes both XML structured data and the initial corresponding wikicode. This version of the resource is intended to remain close to the Wiktionnaire’s content, whereas other lexicons focused on a particular aspect will be released. Our aim is to provide ready-to-use lexicons resulting from different post-processing of GLAWI. Post-processing 3 Resulting from the unification of GLÀFF and an updated version of WiktionaryX, GLAWI stands for “GL ÀFF and Wik-","tionaryX”. This resource is freely available at http://redac.univ-tlse2.fr/lexicons/glawi.html. 67 Figure 2: Extract of the noun subsection of course converted into a workable format steps will consist in 1) selecting information relevant to a particular need (e.g. phonemic transcriptions, semantic relations, etc.) and 2) detecting inconsistencies and correcting them. The initial GLAWI resource, containing all the initial information, will also be released so that anyone can apply additional post-processings. GLAWI unburdens such users from the efforts of parsing the wikicode.","Articles from Wiktionnaire may contain morphologically derived terms. Figures 1 and 2 show that course produces the derived verb courser and noun coursier ‘courier’. Such derivational relations are collected from Wiktionnaire and included in GLAWI. We show below how we leverage this information, in addition to GLAWI’s definitions, to acquire morphological and morphosemantic knowledge."]},{"title":"4 Acquisition of morphological relations from GLAWI morphological subsections","paragraphs":["We first extracted from GLAWI the list of the lexeme headwords that have typographically simple writ-","ten forms (only letters) and that belong to the major POS: noun, verb, adjective, and adverb.

In the following, we will use the terms definiendum for the defined word, definiens for the defining gloss and the notation definiendum = definiens. The definition articulates a number of lexical semantic relations between the definiendum and some words of the definiens as in (1) wherechair is a hyponym of furniture, is the holonym of seat, legs, back and arm rests and is also the typical instrument of sit on. Some of the relations are made explicit by lexical markers as used to or comprising.","(1) chairN = An item of furniture used to sit on or in comprising a seat, legs, back, and some-times arm rests, for use by one person. Martin (1983) uses these relations to characterize the definitions. In his typology, definitions as in (2) are considered to be (morphological) derivational because the definiendum is defined with respect to a morphologically related word. In these definitions, the lexical semantic relation only involves two words that are morphologically related. Being members of the same derivational family, the orthographic representations of these words show some degree of similarity that can help us identify the morphological definitions. In (2) for example, the written formsnitrificateur‘nitrifying’ and nitrification‘nitrification’ share a 10 letters prefix and only differ by 3 letters. This strong similarity is a reliable indicator of their morphologically relatedness (Hathout, 2011b). Building on this observation, a definition is likely to be morphological if its definiens contains a word which is orthographically similar to the definiendum.","(2) nitrificateurA = Qui produit, qui favorise la nitrification. ‘nitrifying’ ‘that produces, that favors nitrification’","We used Proxinette, a measure of morphological similarity defined in (Hathout, 2008), to identify the morphological definitions. Proxinette is designed to reduce the search space for derivational analogies. The reduction is obtained by bringing closer the words that belong to the same derivational families and series, since it is precisely within these paradigms that an entry is likely to form analogies (Hathout, 2011a). Proxinette describes the lexemes by all the n-grams of characters that appear in their inflected forms in order to catch the inflectional stem allomorphy because it tends to also show up in derivation (Bonami et al., 2009). The n-grams have an additional tag that indicates if they occur at the beginning, at the end or in the middle of the word. This information is described by adding a # at the beginning and end of the written forms. For example, in Figure 4, localisation ‘localization’, localiser ‘localize; locate’ and focalisation ‘focalization’ share the ions# ending because it occurs in their inflected forms localisations (plural), localisions (1st person plural, indicative, imperfect) and focalisations (plural). n-grams of size 1 and 2 are ignored because they occur in too many words and are not discriminant enough. Proxinette builds a bipartite graph with the words of the lexicon on one side and the features (n-grams) that characterize them on the other. Each word is linked to all its features and each feature is connected to the words that own it (see Figure 4). The graph is weighted so that the sum of weights of the outgoing edges of each node is equal to 1. Morphological similarity is estimated by simulating the spreading of an activation. For a given entry, an activation is initiated at the node that represents it. This activation is then propagated towards the features of the entry. In a second step, the activations in the feature nodes are propagated towards the words that possess them. The words which obtain the highest activations are the most similar to the entry. The edge weights and the way the graph is traversed brings closer the words that share the largest number of common features and the most specific ones (i.e. the less frequent). 69 focalisation N localiser V #local ocali alisat ation# list #foca localiste A localisation N Figure 4: Excerpt of Proxinette bipartite graph.

We syntactically parsed the definientia with the Talismane dependency parser (Urieli, 2013). Figure 6 presents the dependencies syntactic trees for the definientia in (4).","3. We tagged as morphological all definitions where, in the parsed definiens, at least one lemma (henceforth referred to as morphosemantic head) occurs in the definiendum neighborhood.

After symmetrization, we obtained a lexicon (hereafter GMD) of 107,628 pairs. 32,256 of them belongs to GMS. A manual check of the 75,372 remaining pairs would enable its addition to GMS.","GMD additional pairs have been evaluated by three judges in two steps. The judges were instructed to set aside the orthographic variants as desperado N / despérado N. We first randomly selected 100 pairs and had them checked by three judges in order to estimate the inter-annotator agreement. The average F-measure of the agreement is 0.97 ; Fleiss’s kappa is 0.65. The judges then checked 100 randomly selected pairs each. 9 out of the 300 pairs were variants and 19 errors were found in the 291 remaining ones which results in an overall accuracy of 93.5%. This method would lead to an increase of GMS by more than 70,000 pairs.","The general quality of these acquired pairs can be significantly increased by formal analogy filtering. The idea is to use analogy as a proxy to find pairs of words that are in the same morphological relation. GMS pairs being provided by Wiktionary contributors, we consider them as correct and use them as analogical patterns to filter out the pairs acquired from the morphological definitions. By formal analogy, we mean an analogy between the orthographic representations. For instance, the GMD pair citrique A:citron N form an analogy with électrique A:électron N. The latter being correct, we can assume that the former is correct too. (5) a. citrique A : citron N = électrique A : électron N b. fragmentation N : défragmenter V = concentration N : déconcentrer V Analogies between strings are called formal analogies (Lepage, 2003; Stroppa and Yvon, 2005).

We focus on a particular semantic type, namely definitions of process nominals such as (6) because they can be evaluated with respect to the Verbaction database (Hathout and Tanguy, 2002). Deverbal nominals have been extensively studied in linguistics (Pustejovsky, 1995) and used in a number of tools for various tasks. One of their distinctive feature is that they almost have the same meaning as their base verb. For instance, in (7) the noun and verb phrases are paraphrases of one another. Verbaction contains 9,393 verb-noun pairs where the noun is morphologically related to the verb and can be used to express the act denoted by the verb (e.g. verrouiller:verrouillage).6","It has been","5","Unfortunately, these results could not have been compared with those of Pentheroudakis and Vanderwende (1993) because their system makes use of a number of lexical and semantic resources that are not available for French. However, a comparison with Baroni et al. (2002) is underway although their method is corpus-based (and not MRD-based).","6","Verbaction is freely available at: http://redac.univ-tlse2.fr/lexiques/verbaction.html. 71 used in syntactic dependency parsing by Bourigault (2007), in the construction of the French TimeBank by Bittar et al.

(2008) to assign a semantic type to the definitions that have a nominal definiendum and where the morphosemantic head of the definiens is a verb as in (4) or (6). Verbaction was used to select a corpus of 1,198 of such definitions. Three judges annotated them. 608 definientia were tagged as processive and 590 ones as non processive. We then divided the corpus into a test set made up of 100 processive and 100 non processive definitions and a training set consisting of the remaining definientia.","The classifier is trained to recognize that the definientia in (4) express the same semantic relation between the morphosemantic head of the definiens and the definiendum. We use the method proposed by (Hathout, 2008) to capture this semantic similarity. Definientia are described by a large number of redundant features based on lemmata, POSs and syntactic dependencies. The features are n-grams calculated from Talismane parses (see figure 6). They are defined as follows:","1. We first collect all the paths that go from one word in the definiens to the syntactic root (e.g. [arrêter, pour, action] is a path that starts at arrêter in (4a)). 2. We extract all the n-grams of consecutive nodes in these paths.","3. Each n-gram yields 3 features: the sequence of the node’s lemmata, the sequence of the nodes POS, and the sequence of syntactic dependency relations. We obtained an accuracy of 97% for the semantic typing of the 200 definientia of the test set. The most immediate application of the classifier is the enrichment of Verbaction. Running the classifier on all the definitions with a nominal definiendum and a verbal morphosemantic head will provide us with new couples that could be added to the database. The classifier could also help us type process nouns that are not morphologically derived such as audition ‘hearing’ which is defined with respect to the verb entendre ‘hear’. Similar typing could be performed for other semantic types such as agent nouns (in -eur or -ant), change of state verbs (in -iser or -ifier) or adjectives expressing possibility (in -able), etc. The experiment also shows that morphological definitions are well suited for semantic analysis because they express regular semantic relationship between pairs of words that are distinguished by their orthographic similarity."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have presented GLAWI, an XML machine-readable dictionary created from Wiktionnaire, the French edition of the Wiktionary project. We then showed that GLAWI was well suited for conducting computational morphology experiments. GLAWI contains morphological subsections which provide a significant number of valid and varied morphological relations. In addition, morphological relations can also be acquired from GLAWI morphological definitions. We presented a method to identify these definitions and the words in relation with a fairly good accuracy. We then used formal analogy to filter out almost all the erroneous pairs acquired from morphological definitions. In a second experiment, we demonstrate how to assign the morphological definitions to semantic types with a high accuracy.","This work opens several research avenues leading to a formal representation of the different form and meaning relations that underlie derivational morphology. The next move will be to organize the morphological relations into a graph similar to Démonette (Hathout and Namer, 2014) and identify the paradigms which structure them. We also plan to apply the semantic classification to other semantic types which could ultimately enable us to explore the intricate interplay between form and meaning. 72"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Leticia Anton Pérez, Hugo Gonca̧lo Oliveira, and Paulo Gomes. 2011.
