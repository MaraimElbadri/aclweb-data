The workshop has several related aims. Firstly, it brings together researchers from different backgrounds (e.g., computational linguistics, linguistics, neurolinguistics, psycholinguistics, language technology) to discuss and evaluate compound processing each from their own point of view. Secondly, based on the interaction between the participants, the workshop provides an overview of existing and desired resources for future research in this area. Finally, we expect that the interdisciplinary approach of the workshop will result in better methodologies to evaluate compound processing systems from different perspectives. Given the high productivity of compounding in a wide range of languages, compound processing is an interesting subject in linguistics, computational linguistics, and other applied disciplines. For example, for many language technology applications, compound processing remains a challenge (both morphologically and semantically), since novel compounds are created and interpreted on the fly. In order to deal with this productivity, systems that can analyse new compound forms and their meanings need to be developed. From an interdisciplinary perspective, we also need to better understand the process of compounding (as a cognitive process), in order to model its complexity. iii Workshop Organizers Ben Verhoeven, University of Antwerp, Belgium Walter Daelemans, University of Antwerp, Belgium Menno van Zaanen, Tilburg University, The Netherlands Gerhard van Huyssteen, North-West University, South Africa Program Committee Preslav Nakov, Qatar Computing Research Institute Iris Hendrickx, Radboud University Nijmegen Lonneke Van der Plas, University of Stuttgart Helmut Schmid, Ludwig Maximilian University Munich Roald Eiselen, North-West University Pavol Štekauer, P.J.
