Current baseline methods often use token-based features which cannot properly capture more complex linguistic phenomena and emotional composition in fine grained emotion detection. A novel supervised learning approach―segment-based fine-grained emotion detection model for Chinese text has been proposed in this paper. Different from most existing methods, the proposed model applies the hierarchical structure of sentence (e.g., dependency relationship) and exploits segment-based features. Furthermore, the emotional composition in short text is addressed by using the log linear model. We perform emotion detection on our dataset: news contents, fairly tales, and blog dataset, and compare our proposed method to representative existing approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed segment-based model."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Emotion detection aims to identify fine-grained emotion categories (e.g., happy, angry, disgust, fear, sadness and surprise) of a given text, and it is a challenging and difficult problem with applications throughout natural language processing.","Currently, the most widely used probability models for emotion classification are supervised based machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) etc,. Researchers have trained the classifier depends on corpus-based features, mainly unigrams, combined with lexical features (Alm et al, 2005; Aman and Szpakowicz, 2007; Katz, et al, 2007). Nevertheless, these methods used in the emotion classification system concentrate on token based features and do not include any linguistic or contextual information, which often yields poor performance. Therefore, recent studies have investigated the approach using contextual information around emotional words to identify fine grained emotion classes. (Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2010) observe that the emotion word, POS, intensifier and direct dependency features play an importan-t role in extracting emotional expressions as well as tagging sentences with emotions and intensities. (Diman Ghazi et al., 2012) propose an approach which takes the contextual emotion of a word and the syntactic structure of the sentence into account to classify sentences by emotion classes. However, these works still use token-based features, which cannot address the problem of the emotional composition, especially those that are the expression-level representations.","There has been previous work using composition rules and statistical methods to handle sentiment composition. (Moilanen and Pulman, 2007) propose a theoretical composition model, and evaluate a lexical dependency parsing post-process implementation, which treat both negation and intensifier via three models: sentiment propaga-tion, polarity conflict resolution and polarity reversal. (Choi and Cardie, 2008) incorporate structural inference motivated by compositional semantics into the learning procedure for subsentential sentiment analysis. (Socher et al., 2011, 2012) present matrix-vector representations with a recursive neural network. The model is built on a parse tree where the nodes are associated to a vector. The matrix captures how each constituent modifies its neighbor. (Baptiste Chardon et al,. 2013) propose a computational model that accounts for the effects of negation and modality on opinion expressions. However, it is not as clear how to use a compositional treatment to classify fine grained emotion classes. Sentiment composition combines 52 individual positive and negative words or phrases, and the final polarity of a sentence is positive or negative. Nevertheless, it is more challenging and difficult to make categorization into distinct emotion classes for the higher level of classification in emotion recognition task. In order to facilitate our discussion, consider the following examples:","1.不过在教堂里,站在讲台上的牧师却是大叫 大嚷,非常生气. (But inside the church the pastor stood in the pulpit, and spoke very loudly and angrily.)[anger]","2.迷 信 使 她 的 血 一 会 儿 变 冷,一 会 儿 变 热.(Superstition made her alternately shudder with cold or burn with the heat of fever.)[fear]","3.骑 在 桦 木 条 上 的 那 个 蜡 人 忽 然 变 得 又 高 又 大 了.他 像 一 阵 旋 风 似 地 扑 向 纸 花 那 儿 去,说:”居然把这样的怪想头灌进一个孩子的脑 子里去!全是些没有道理的幻想!”这蜡人跟那 位戴宽帽子的枢密顾问官一模一样,而且他的 那副面孔也是跟顾问官一样发黄和生气.可是 那些纸花在他的瘦腿上打了一下,于是他缩做 一团,又变成了一个渺小的蜡人.(All at once the wax doll which rode on the carnival rod seemed to grow larger and taller, and it turned round and said to the paper flowers, ”How can you put such things in a child’s head? they are all foolish fancies;” and then the doll was exactly like the lawyer with the broad brimmed hat, and looked as yellow and as cross as he did; but the paper dolls struck him on his thin legs, and he shrunk up again and became quite a little wax doll.)[anger]","In the first example, we can use the key words ”大 叫”,”大 嚷”(spoke very loudly), and ”生 气”(anger), to easily identify the emotion classes of the sentence. However, in the second example, we cannot use the words ”血”(blood), ”变 冷”(make cold), ”变热”(make burn) or the phrase ”血变冷” and ”血变热” to easily detect the final emotion category of the sentence. ”血” and ”变 冷” carry ”fear” category, and the words ”血” and ”变热” can be classified as ”joy”, but the final emotion label of the sentence is ”fear”. In the last example, there are four types of emotion classes for sub-sentential segments, for example, ”蜡人变 得又高又大”( the wax doll seemed to grow larger and taller)[joy], ”怪想头”(such things) [surprise], ”没有道理的幻想!”(foolish fancies)[anger], ”生 气”(anger) [anger], and ”一个渺小的蜡人”( a little wax doll)[sad], but the overall emotion of the short text is ”anger”.","These examples demonstrate that a sentence or short text exists several expression-level emotion labels, and the words or constituents interact with each other to yield the overall emotion label, which cannot be easily resolved by token-based methods. To solve this problem, we present segment-based supervised learning approach to in-vestigate how to recognize the overall emotion tag of a sentence or short text. Closer to our current purposes is the work of (Nakagawa et al, 2010). It employs a conditional random field (CRF) for sentiment classification of Japanese and English subjective sentences using dependency tree-based method. In their method, the sentiment polarity of each dependency subtree, which is not observable in training data, is represented by a hidden variable. The polarity of the whole sentence is calculated in consideration of interactions between the hidden variables. However, this research doesn’t work on the fine grained emotion recognition and it is unable to deal with multiple consecutive to-kens (e.g., a phrase).","In this paper, we employ semi-Markov conditional random fields (semi-CRFs) for segment-based emotion detection. Semi-CRFs (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004) are more powerful than CRFs in that they can assign labels to segments instead of tokens; hence, features can be defined at the segment level. To our knowledge, segment-based fine-grained emotion recognition for Chinese text has not been attempted. Our learning framework can be determined in a three-step process: (1) segment the input sentence or short text into some dependency subtrees and then (2) employ the semi-CRFs with various context informed features to assess the emotion classes of the constituents of the segment, and (3) exploit a composition learning model to combine the segment level emotion labels. We evaluate the proposed model on our construction dataset, which consists of news content, fairy tales and blog dataset, and the experimental results show that segment-based learning algorithm works well in our experimental data."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Supervised learning method has been well studied and used in fine-grained emotion detection with promising results. (Alm et al., 2005) explores the text-based emotion prediction problem empirically, using supervised machine learning. (Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2010) deals with the extraction of emotional expressions and tagging of English 53 blog sentences with Ekman’s six basic emotion tags and any of the three intensities: low, medium and high. Baseline system is developed based on WordNet Affect lists and dependency relation-s. SVM based supervised framework is employed by incorporating different word and context level features. (Chaffar and Inkpen, 2011) adopts a supervised machine learning approach to recognize six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise) using a heterogeneous emotion-annotated dataset which combines news headlines, fairy tales and blogs. (Saif Mohammad, 2012) uses word-level affect lexicons to provide significant improvements in sentence-level emotion classification. (Purver and Battersby, 2012) describe a set of experiments using automatically labeled data to train supervised classifiers for multi-class emotion detection in Twitter messages with no manual intervention. (Diman Ghazi et al., 2012) present a method which enables us to take the contextual emotion of a word and the syntactic structure of the sentence into account to classify sentences by emotion classes.","Other related studies on this task are emotion resource construction. (Xu et al., 2010) adopts a graph-based algorithm to build Chinese emotion lexicons for public use. (Patra et al., 2013) uses the Potts model for constructing emotion lexicon annotated with Ekman’s six basic emotion classes. There are also studies that analyzed the deeper level information, such as color-concept-emotion associations (Volkova et al., 2012); emotion causes detection (Chen et al., 2010); and learning hashtags to improve emotion classification performance (Qadir and Riloff, 2013). In sentiment composition, the presence of modalities is generally used to combine the individual positive and negative word (Moilanen and Pulman, 2007; Choi and Cardie, 2008; Nakagawa, 2010; Socher et al., 2011, 2012; Chardon et al,.2013). There is a few works on the higher level of composition in emotion recognition task.","Different from above approaches, we use a segment-based method for the fine-grained emotion detection. To use the strengths of segment-based features, we propose to employ the semi-Markov Conditional Random Field, which was previously used in information extraction to tag continuous segments of input sequences and out-performed conventional CRFs in the task of named entity recognition and opinion extraction (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004; Okanohara et al., 2006; Andrew, 2006; Yang and Cardie, 2012). We describe this model in the following section."]},{"title":"3 Segment-based Emotion Detection using semi-CRF","paragraphs":["In this section, we first introduce the semi-Markov conditional random field and then elaborate the proposed segment-based emotion detection model. 3.1 Semi-CRF In this subsection we briefly review the semi-Markov conditional random field. We follow the definitions in (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004). Let s = sm","1 =< s1, · · · , sm > denote a segmentation of an observed sequence x. To represent all the information associated with each segmentation, we define si as si =< ti, ui, yi >, which consisting of three components: a start position ti, an end position ui, and a label yi. We assume that segments have a positive length bounded above by the pre-defined upper bound L (1 ≤ ui − ti + 1 ≤ |x|) and completely cover the sequence x without overlapping, that is, s satisfies t1 = 1, um = |x|, and ti + 1 = ui + 1 for i = 1, ..., m-1. For emotion detection, a valid segmentation of the sentence ” 善 良 的 姑 娘细心地照顾这只弱小的猫” might be s =< (1, 3, happy), (4, 6, happy), (7, 11, sad) >, corresponding to the label sequence y =< happy, happy, sad >.","Then, Semi-CRF defines a conditional probability of a state sequence y given an observed sequence x by: p(y, s|x) =","1 Z(x)","exp( m ∑ i=1 |s| ∑ t=1 λifi(x, s, y)) (1)","where fi(x, s, y) = fi(yj−1, yj, x, sj) is a feature function and Z(x) is the normalization factor as defined for CRF. The model parameters are a set of real-valued weights λ = {λj}, each of which represents the weight of a feature. Z(x) = ∑ s′","exp( m ∑ i=1 |s| ∑ t=1","λifi(x, s′ , y)) (2) The inference problem for semi-CRF can be solved by using a semi-Markov analog of the usual Viterbi algorithm. An implementation of semi-CRF is available at http://crf.sourceforge.net. 54 3.2 Segment-based Emotion Detection Model In this subsection, we will describe our segment-based emotion detection model (see Figure 1).","Assume that we are given a sequence of observations x = xJ","1 =< x1, · · · , xJ > and we would like to infer a corresponding label yt",", where yt","∈ y is one of the Ekman’s six basic emotion types such as happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, anger and disgust. Every emotion class is regarded as a possible emotion tag for the input sentence or short text with a posterior probability p(y|x).","Our proposed segment-based approach can be determined in a three-step process: at first, a sentence or short text is divided into non-fixed length segments. We construct segment units from the dependency parse tree of each sentence, and then build up possible segment candidates based on those units. More specifically, the dependency subtrees that contain the path from the root node (e.g., core verb 照 顾(take care of)) to leaf node are selected for the candidate segmentation. For instance, let us consider the subjective sentence ”善 良 的 姑 娘 细 心 地 照 顾 这 只 弱 小 的 猫”(Good girl carefully take care of the small cat). The dependency parse tree of this sentence is illustrated in Figure 2. We can select four dependency subtrees (善良的姑娘,照 顾) ( good girl, take care of), (细 心 地,照 顾) ( carefully, take care of), (照 顾,这 只,猫) ( take care of, the cat), and (照顾,弱小的猫) ( take care of, the small cat) as the candidate segmentations. The reason that the dependency representations are chosen as the segment unit is, compared with phrase-structure tree, it can describe more complicated structure information of a sentence (such as the long distance dependency relation). Then, we use the segmentation strings as observations and supply various context-informed features as inputs to the semi-CRF to assess the emotion classes of the segment. That is, instead of determining y directly from x, we introduce hidden variables z = (z1, · · · , zm) as intermediate decision variables, where zi = (si, yi) and yi ∈ { happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, anger, disgust, none }, so that yi represents whether si is a phrase with happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, anger, or disgust, or none of the above. In the above example, we can obtain the emotion label of each segment y =< happy, happy, happy, sad >. At last, once we determine the intermediate decision variables, we use a probabilistic model based on log linear model to combine expression-level emotion categories. For simplicity, we decompose the probability by introducing two probability distribution models: expression-level emotion detection model and emotion tag distribution model. Specifically, for the segment-based emotion detection problem, the discriminate function can be defined as follows: p(yt","|x) = ∑","s,y","p(sK 1 |x) · p(yK","1 |sK","1 , x) · p(yt","|yK","1 , sK","1 , x) = ∑ s,y K∏ k=1","p(yK","1 , sK 1 |x) · p(yt","|yK","1 ) (3)","There are two probability distributions:","- Expression-level emotion detection model: p(y, s|x). This model describes the distribution of the sequence of segmentation si(1 : k) and its corresponding emotion tag yi(1 : k). This distribution can be calculated directly by the semi-CRF model.","- Emotion tag distribution model: p(yt","|yK","1 ). This model describes the probability distribution of the emotion classes. Where yK","1 is expression-level emotion tag and yt","indicates the overall emotion tag. This distribution can be calculated by similar n-gram model.","In this study, we use the maximum a posteriori estimation with Gaussian priors for parameter estimation. The inference problem can be solved by the Viterbi algorithm. Figure 1: Graphical presentation for semi-CRF segment based model 3.3 Feature Design We reused features in the original token-based model based on unigram, POS tags, emotion word lists and context-informed dependency relations.","Bag-of-words: Surface forms of word unigram-s and bigrams in the sentence are used as features. 55 Figure 2: A dependency parse tree example. There are four segment units in the sentence","Part-of-speech: The part-of-speech (POS) of the current word and the surrounding words are used as a feature for emotion classification.","Content bag-of-words: N (noun), V (verb), JJ (adjective) words by POS is used as features.","Emotion word lists: This set of features is based on the emotion-word itself. The emotion class of a word can be assigned as the word’s prior emotion tag according to the Chinese emotion lexicon, which is a translation and extension version of WordNet-Affect lexicon and its construction details described as section 4.1.","Dependency relations: This set of features is binary indicators of whether the leaf phrase in the dependency parse tree belongs to one of the emotion classes. The dependencies are all binary relations: a grammatical relation holds between a governor (head) and a dependent (modifier). Dependency arcs are stored as 3-tuples of the form < w1, r, w2 >, denoting occurrences of words w1 and word w2 related by the syntactic dependency r.","After parsing the sentence and getting the dependencies, we count the following dependency-tree boolean features for the emotional word, if this sentence have the emotional words:","- Whether the word is in a ”neg” dependency (negation modifier): true when there is a negation word which modifies the emotional word.","- Whether the word is in an ”amod” dependency (adjectival modifier): true if the emotional word is (i) a noun modified by an adjective or (ii) an adjective modifying a noun.","- Whether the word is in an ”advmod” dependency (adverbial modifier): true if the emotional word (i) is a non-clausal adverb or adverbial phrase which serves to modify the meaning of a word, or (ii) has been modified by an adverb.","If the sentence has not any emotional word, we will consider the adjective words and its around words."]},{"title":"4 Experiments and results 4.1 Data Construction","paragraphs":["In this subsection, we explain the dataset and lexicon used in our experiments. Table 1 shows the details of the construction dataset, and Figure 3 displays the distribution of the six emotion classes (happy, fear, sad, surprised, angry, and disgust) in the corpora. The various corpora and lexicon have the following origins:","(1) Chinese emotion lexicon. Currently, there is not any open and free existing Chinese emotion lexicon with fine-grained emotion classes. There-fore, the first resource we need to construct is an emotional lexicon of Chinese with various emotion categories. The English WordNet Affect lists (Strapparava et al., 2004) based on Ekman’s six basic emotion types have adequate number of emotion word entries. These English words lists can be used to convert to Chinese words using English to Chinese bilingual dictionary or thesaurus. Our final lexicon contains 1810 entries.","(2) News dataset. This news domain corpus is created manually by two annotators. The annotation process proceeds as follows: they have been trained separately and work independently in order to avoid any annotation bias and get a true understanding of the task difficulty. Each annotator marks the sentence level or short text with one of six primary emotions (Ekman, 1992), and then calculate the kappa value to assess such reliability regarding emotion categories with a value of 0.7 or above it indicating complete agreement. Disagreements can be annotated by the third one, then calculate the kappa value.","(3) Alm’s translation dataset. This data set is based on Alm’s dataset (Alm et al., 2005), which include annotated sentences from fairy tales, and five emotion tags (happy, fearful, sad, surprised and angry-disgusted) from the Ekman’s list of basic emotions were used for sentences or short text annotations. The construction process of this dataset proceeds as follows: firstly, we collec-t English-Chinese parallel corpora of fairy tales, and split the text into individual sentences. Secondly, select Chinese sentences which corresponding translation appeared in Alm’s Dataset accord-56 Table 1: The dataset entries used in our experiment Chinese emotion lexicon Alm’s translation dataset News dataset Blog dataset unlabeled corpora 1810 1223 1135 1000 115M Figure 3: The distribution of the six emotions (happy, fear, sad, surprised, angry, and disgust)in the corpora ing to sentence alignment strategy. Lastly, annotate angry and disgusted sentences by manually. Since Alm’s dataset doesn’t separate the angry and disgusted categories.","(4) Blog dataset. This dataset consists of emotion-rich sentences or short text collected from blogs. These sentences or short text are labeled with six emotion tags by two annotators. The annotation process is the same as that of news dataset.","(5) Unlabeled corpora. We downloaded addi-tional 15M Chinese version of children’s story from Andersen’s and Green’s fairy tales and 100M Chinese news dataset to use as the unlabeled set. We haven’t select blog corpora, because it is noisy. This allows us to check the performance of each system on the same kinds of data, and the unlabeled set and the test set are in the same domain and have similar underlying feature distributions. 4.2 Preprocessing Given a labeled or an unlabeled data, we first carry out segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging on each sentence or short text using the Stanford toolkit, and then apply a simple word filter based on POS tags to select content words (noun-s, verbs, and adjectives). In next step, we create dependency parse tree produced by the Stanford dependency parser, and construct dependency subtrees. As we all know, the performance of Chinese dependency parser is not very satisfactory. Hence, we modify several wrong results manually. We just want to testify our idea of that the fragments based on dependency grammar are better than to-kens. 4.3 Experimental Results In this subsection, we report experimental results on our dataset which contains news dataset, Alm’s translation dataset and blogs dataset. The entries of our dataset are short text or sentence. The news dataset consists of 1135 entries and its average length is 27.09. The Alm’s translation dataset consist of 1223 entries and its average length 34.76. The blog dataset contains 1000 entries and its average length is 30.73. The tasks on the Alm’s translation dataset may be difficult because the syntactic structures of the sentences are less restricted and highly variable.","Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4 respectively shows the accuracy result of our segment-based method compared to two token-based approach using SVM and MaxEnt, and a segment-based method using CRF models (similar to the work of (Nakagawa et al., 2010)), which employ five kinds of feature sets (BOW, contentBOW, part-of-speech, emotion words and dependency relation-s) and their combination features, setting 10-fold cross validation as a testing option.","As shown in Table 2-4, we can obtain below conclusions:","(1) We can see that our approach based on the 57 Table 2: Experimental results on news dataset % Feature SVM MaxEnt CRF Our approach BOW 46.84 46.1 53.29 53.33 contentBOW 48.59 47.8 55 55.74 contentBOW+POS 48.64 47.67 56.78 56.69 contentBOW+Emotion 51.46 50.7 57.41 58.55 contentBOW+Emotion+POS 50.2 47.1 58.53 61.53 contentBOW+Emotion+POS+Dependency 54.45 54.32 59.06 65.12 Table 3: Experimental results on Alm’s translation dataset % Feature SVM MaxEnt CRF Our approach BOW 39.59 40.30 35.79 40.09 contentBOW 39.98 40.59 35.87 42.11 contentBOW+POS 40.19 38.82 36.05 43.95 contentBOW+Emotion 45.86 42.26 39.44 46.49 contentBOW+Emotion+POS 46.15 40.98 41.89 48.95 contentBOW+Emotion+POS+Dependency 48.23 45.05 45.68 50.81 Table 4: Experimental results on blog dataset % Feature SVM MaxEnt CRF Our approach BOW 46.09 45.81 44.24 45.62 contentBOW 46.34 46.06 46.33 46.19 contentBOW+POS 46.56 45.93 46.92 47.01 contentBOW+Emotion 47.92 46.03 47.23 47.63 contentBOW+Emotion+POS 48.38 45.77 47.98 48.63 contentBOW+Emotion+POS+Dependency 50.05 48.12 49.61 53.23 segment-based semi-CRF model has the highest accuracy rate for each dataset using the combination features of contentBOW + Emotion + POS + Dependency. Segment-based approach performed better than token-based approach for the news dataset, but without expected results for the Alm’s translation and blogs dataset. This result, on the one hand, demonstrates that Semi-CRF is more powerful than CRF, and on the other hand, our emotion tag distribution model gives effective results. For token-based method, SVM gives a better result than MaxEnt for all three of our Chinese corpora.","(2) The accuracy rate of SVM has slightly less than our model, but the results of MaxEnt and CRF is unbalanced. As we notice from table 2 to table 4, CRF gives better results on the news dataset than on the Alm’s translation dataset, but the results of MaxEnt on all dataset is worst. The reasons for this result may be due to the bias problem of MaxEnt.","(3) We can observe that using the combination features of contentBOW + Emotion + POS + Dependency has the highest accuracy rate for each dataset and each classifier. There are two types of features achieve significantly improvements: emotion words and the dependency relations, for example, on news dataset, SVM with contentBOW has the accuracy rate of 48.59% and adding emotion words has the accuracy rate of 51.46%, showing the improvements of 2.87%. This is not surprising result since emotion words has key in-fluence to detection of the emotion category of a sentence. However, the words or constituents in-teract with each other to yield the overall emotion label, there exists expression level emotion. Dependency relationship features can solve this problem and improve the performance of the system,like in the example above,adding Dependency relationship features has the accuracy rate of 58 54.45%, showing the improvements of 5.86%.","When the baseline system use the contentBOW features, the POS, Emotion and Dependency representation improve the accuracy rates of the SVM, CRF and our classifier for each dataset, but the use of POS representation for the MaxEnt classifier decreased the accuracy rate compared to the Emotion and Dependency representations. One reason lead to this problem might be the quality of the data we use in this experiment.","(4) Overall performances on the news dataset are better than on the Alm’s translation dataset and blogs dataset. The reason perhaps is that the syntactic structures of the sentences from Alm’s translation dataset are less restricted and highly variable, and the sentences from blogs dataset are noisy, and there exist some linguistic or spelling error."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we present a segment-based learning approach for fine-grained emotion detection.
