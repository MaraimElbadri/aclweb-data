Recent advances in digital storage and networking, coupled with the extension of HLT into ever broader areas and the persistence of difficulties in software portability, have led to an increased focus on development and deployment of web-based infrastructures that allow users to access tools and other resources and combine them to create novel solutions that can be efficiently composed, tuned, evaluated, disseminated and consumed. This in turn engenders collaborative development and deployment among individuals and teams across the globe. It also increases the need for robust, widely available evaluation methods and tools, means to achieve interoperability of software and data from diverse sources, means to handle licensing for limited access resources distributed over the web, and, perhaps crucially, the need to develop strategies for multi-site collaborative work. For many decades, NLP has suffered from low software engineering standards, resulting in a limited degree of re-usability of code and interoperability of different modules within larger NLP systems. While this did not really hamper success in limited task areas, it caused serious problems for building complex integrated software systems, e.g., for information extraction or machine translation. This lack of integration has led to duplicated software development, work-arounds for programs written in different (versions of) programming languages, and ad-hoc tweaking of interfaces between modules developed at different sites. In recent years, several efforts have been devoted to the development of frameworks to to allow the easy integration of varied tools through common type systems and standardized communication methods for components analyzing unstructured textual information. These include two frameworks, UIMA and GATE, which have been widely adopted within the HLT community to facilitate the creation of reusable HLT components that can be assembled to address different HLT tasks depending on their order, combination and configuration. At the same time, major projects in the US, EU, and Asia have recently undertaken the development of web service platforms for HLT, in order to exploit the growing number of web-based tools and services available for HLT-related tasks including corpus annotation, configuration and execution of tool pipelines, and evaluation of results and automatic parameter tuning. These platforms may also integrate modules and pipelines from existing frameworks such as UIMA and GATE, in order to achieve interoperability with a wide variety of modules from different sources. Many of the issues and challenges surrounding these developments have been addressed individually in particular projects and workshops, but there are ramifications that cut across all of them. This workshop brings together participants representing the range of interests that comprise the comprehensive picture for community-driven, distributed, collaborative, web-based development and use for language processing software and resources, including developers of HLT infrastructures as well as those who will use these services and infrastructures, especially for multi-site collaborative work. The program includes presentations describing approaches to the range of challenges posed by such development, including legal issues concerning licensing of components and tools; the technical aspects of packaging and distribution of components; means to assemble complex processing pipelines and manage large bodies of data; means to visualize, explore, and further deploy analysis results; and issues surrounding the preservation of analysis results, provenance documentation, and evaluation and reproducibility. The overall goal is to work toward eliminating the fragmentation and duplication of effort that currently characterizes the field by establishing the basis of a community effort to develop and support the global laboratory for HLT development and research. iii"]},{"title":"Workshop Committee Program Co-Chairs","paragraphs":["Jens Grivolla, Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Spain) Nancy Ide, Vassar College (USA) General Organizers Kalina Bontcheva, University of Sheffield (UK) Christopher Cieri, Linguistic Data Consortium (USA) Eric Nyberg, Carnegie Mellon University (USA) James Pustejovsky, Brandeis University (USA) Jonathan Wright, Linguistic Data Consortium (USA) Program Committee: Al Asswad, Mohammad, Cornell University Nuria Bel, Universitat Pompeu Fabra Steven Bethard, University of Alabama at Birmingham Philipp Cimiano, Universität Bielefeld Joan Codina, Universitat Pompeu Fabra Kevin Cohen, University of Colorado School of Medicine Azad Dehghan, University of Manchester Leon Derczynski, University of Sheffield Richard Eckart de Castilho, TU Darmstadt Nicolai Erbs, TU Darmstadt Thilo Götz, IBM Deutschland Mark A.
