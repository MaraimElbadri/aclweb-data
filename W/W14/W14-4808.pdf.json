Neologisms are a powerful spearhead for science and, needless to say, for the language(s) of science.","Field specialists come in touch with new term creations and concepts both in the process of knowledge reception and knowledge production. In both cases, Spanish specialistsï need to concept ualise, verbalise and stabilise the new concepts is often mediated by English as a scientific lingua franca. This results in a diminished capability of non-English speakers to both apprehend and exploit the potential of the new conceptual and linguistic coinages and to cast their own ideas and scientific constructions onto functionally adequate linguistic moulds. We acknowledge that science, at least for the foreseeable future, will be ícreatedì mostly in English, but con tend that it can be enriched and expanded by helping it í speakì other languages through translation from and into English.","In the first phase of our project we are concentrating on the knowledge-reception process alone. Our team of Spanish-speaking language, terminology and translation experts and researchers will be monitoring the way neuroscientists cognitively and linguistically cope and deal with conceptual and terminological neologisms when reading recent English articles. To gather this knowledge, we are experimenting with the design of a collaborative tool to collect relevant information of the specialistsï e ncounter with neological occurrences."]},{"title":"2 Defining and detecting neologisms","paragraphs":["Neologisms appear in order to fulfil denominative needs. They challenge a language code, pushing it to its limits, but, at the same time, provide the basis for its survival and development (S¬ánchez Ib¬á¬ñez, 2013: 58-65). Linguistic classification of neologisms (e.g. morphosyntactic, semantic, loans, calques) would not be beneficial for neuroscientists while processing the scientific information they read, as this would detract from their concentration on the subject matter and ícontaminateì the ecology of the activity, by letting an alien expert domain intrude into their habitual knowledge-reception task. We need to provide neuroscientists íontologically cleanì (Winograd and Flores, 1986: 165) linguistic means to help them identify and communicate their neological experiences.","A cognitive-ontological model that has successfully focused on íunits of understandingì (rather than static, universal terms or concepts), historical determinations, diachronic evolution and domain expert participation, is Temmermanïs sociocognitive approach to terminology (2000), which later led to ítermon tographyì (see, for instanc e Temmerman and Kerremans, 2003; Kerremans, 2004).

It is crucial to get as much ípractical understandingì (Ehn, 1992: 122 -123) of the task that the users will undertake and of potential breakdown; to stimulate the task by not interfering too much in it, unencumbered but enhanced by the interactive and linguistic scaffolding of our tool.","The necessary (hopefully minimal but productive) interference with neuroscientistsï cognitive pr ocess must be compensated for by satisfying other needs they may (consciously or unconsciously) have or providing them with a rewarding experience (Hassenzahl, 2010). They must be aware that their participation will help science (not only Spanish science) and Spanish as a language of science; at the same time, even those who have no linguistic inclinations must find that, by focusing on the way language represents and creates reality, the tool can help reinforce, deepen and enhance the understanding of the concepts they read and of their potential implications. Ideally, our tool should also become a friendly platform for neuroscientists to read and annotate all their articles.","In order to test what interface, actions, language and workflows could accomplish all this, we will turn to prototyping as a fundamental method in Human-Computer Interaction. íThe ability to shape and reshape software requires a capacity for rapid prototyping ê for turning an unarticulated idea into a working prototype quickly enough to be able to change it, to listen to it, even to throw it out and to go on to anotherì (Winograd, 1996: 206)."]},{"title":"4 Prototype experiment for expert neologism detection and characterization","paragraphs":["The outline of the experiment is as follows: first, our neuroscientist expert subjects will be assigned a recent journal article about some new development in the field in English. The approximate length of each unit of cognitive-textual processing should be one page (a section or a number of sections totalling that length or thereabouts).","As they read, subjects are encouraged to highlight what they consider to be key elements of the text (mono- or plurilexical terms). Afterwards, they will be required to mark concepts or terms that can be considered as new. These new concepts may be expressed through mono- or plurilexical terms, but they can also appear in the form of denominative periphrasis or other kinds of non-lexicalised expressions (Garc¬ía Palacios, 2009: 19; S¬ánchez Ib¬á¬ñez, 2013: 295-308). A term or expression will be considered as a neologism if the expert has only been aware of its existence in recent years.","Once the candidate neologisms are identified, experts will have to decide to what broad category of the field of neuroscience the expression identified as new pertains. Then, they will be requested to explain in Spanish and in their own words the novel aspects discovered in the text. The subjects are expected to emphasise in what respect (activities, situations, cases...) new aspects could be relevant.","Finally, experts will have to suggest other terms or categories (both in English and in Spanish) related to the concept they are describing. This last task is meant to detect categories, conceptual frames to which the identified candidate neologism may belong or prototypical characteristics of the concept.","This first pilot experiment should measure the adequacy of the proposal, and in particular: ¬• The most adequate unit of cognitive processing (section, page, paragraph, time).","¬• The degree of distortion the experiment imposes on the process of reading, and whether the task implies a cognitive overload. ¬• To what extent experts are willing to engage in the experiment, whether they find it motivating. 65","¬• From a qualitative perspective, which elements experts identify as novel and which not, allowing us to get a feeling of the clues for the identification of new concepts."]},{"title":"5 Tools for the development of the prototype experiment","paragraphs":["For the practical development of our prototype experiments we are considering to use the upper categories of the NIFSTD ontology and wikis as a collaborative tool. The availability and suitability for our research of the former has been considered in Maroto (2013).","NIFSTD (NIF Standard) ontology stands out as the most comprehensive ontology of the neurosciences available on the web. Its wide coverage and its degree of normalisation and reusability make this ontology particularly suitable for our research purposes. It is composed of several modules, each one covering a distinct domain of neuroscience (Bug et al, 2008) and reflecting the semantic domains covered by NIFSTD: organism taxonomy, molecules, macroscopic anatomy, sub-cellular anatomy, cell, nervous system function, nervous system dysfunction, phenotypic qualities and investigation.","The upper classes of the ontology will be used in our research as ítagsì so that experts can categ orise neologisms identified during the reception of specialised articles. Therefore, these upper classes will shape the initial framework of categories from which our top-down strategy starts, which in turn-will later be refined thanks to expertsï contributions.","At this stage, we need to test to what extent the conceptual classes proposed by existing ontologies can be used as a valuable tool to help experts categorise new terms and concepts. As our research de-velops, we might want to integrate our findings within an ontology structure (either NIFïs or our own).","We also need a collaborative tool for collecting and linking expert knowledge during the experiments. A wiki can be defined as collaborative software that allows different users to develop web sites in a simple way using a simplified mark-up language, based on linking interrelated concepts and tracking changes. A \"wiki is a written-down memory with a lot more space than the built-in one, and it's a collective memory, too\" (Stafford and Webb 2006). In a wiki \"What You Think Is What You Get\".","The main reasons that justify the use of wikis in our experiments are that most scientists are already familiar with this kind of software and the fact that wikis are accessible anytime from anywhere with a web connection. Besides, every detail about the editing is stored in the wiki, that is, we can later analyse how much time our experts spent editing, whether they made many or few changes, etc.","Finally, wikis offer the possibility to \"tag\" pages and to link concepts. Our experts will be required to categorise new terms and/or concepts, that is, to assign one or more cognitive ítagsì to the newly discovered concept. Neuroscientists will be given a set of proposed tags from the upper level of NIFSTD ontology to label their responses to our experiments. In this way the suitability of upper-level ontological classes could be tested and, if necessary, the categories could be revised and/or refined.  This contribution presents the theoretical and methodological framework that is the basis of our research. However, a lot of work still lays ahead in order to check the validity of our proposal."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work is supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness within the national project NeuroNEO \"Regulaci¬ón de los procesos neol¬ógicos y los neologismos en las ¬áreas de neurociencias\" (code FFI2012-34596)."]},{"title":"Reference","paragraphs":["William J.
