It was co-sponsored by ASIALEX and endorsed by SIGLEX. The workshop aimed to bring together members of the language-resource (LR) landscape, focusing on complex linguistic knowledge that requires linguistic expertise, e.g. on dictionaries, ontologies and grammars. Such manually-built resources are key to the development of natural language processing (NLP) tools and applications. We intended to strengthen the cohesion of the scientific ’production chain’ spanning from the construction of LRs to their exploitation in hybrid or symbolic NLP. It is necessary to increase mutual awareness between researchers along this production chain, regarding their activities, skills and needs, in view of improving the building processes of the resources, their validation and their exploitation. Many linguists are comfortable with descriptive tasks such as checking lexical entries for a given feature, even if each entry requires analysing or pondering. On the other hand, computer scientists are familiar with formalization and, usually, with notions such as falsifiability or reproducibility, which are fundamental to sciences. Combining all these skills is likely to stimulate innovation. The workshop offered an opportunity of interaction which is required to overcome the compartmentalization between humanities and sciences, and to intensify co-operation between the two ends of the chain. Researchers were encouraged to exchange about how they manage to face several challenges:","• the context of this production chain requires that they not be content with understanding phenomena, but also achieve actual production of formalized results;","• resulting resources should reach a reasonable level of verifiability, e.g. by finding formal or syntactic bases as a support to semantic description; • methods which are able to cover the most diverse languages are to be preferred;","• the format of manual construction of complex LRs must be highly readable, so that errors can be easily detected and corrected;","• conceptual models are not easy to assign to large amounts of language data; due to idiosyncratic behaviour of lexical entries, it is often required to manually examine them individually as regards syntax or semantics;","• many multiword expressions, including support-verb constructions, are somewhere halfway between compositional and non-compositional constructs;","• actual implementation of NLP systems and real-world applications may provide feedback on complex lexical and grammatical LRs used in them, but experimentation is required to accurately relate features of the LRs with features of results obtained in NLP. We received 31 submissions and accepted 19: an acceptance rate of 61%. We scheduled 10 papers for oral presentation and 9 as posters. The workshop closed with a general discussion. We would like to thank the members of the Program Committee for their timely reviews. We would also like to thank the authors for their valuable contributions.
