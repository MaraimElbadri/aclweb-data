Previous reports of annotated corpus of clinical notes have been small and they do not represent the whole doma in of clinical notes. The sentences included in this corpus have been selected from a very large raw corpus of ten thousand documents. These ten thousand documents are sampled from an internal repos itory of more than 700,000 documents taken from multiple health care providers. Each of the documents is de-identified to remove any PHI data. Using the Penn Treebank tagging guidelines with a bit of mod if ic a t ions , we annotate this corpus manually w it h an average inter-annotator agreement of more than 98%. The goal is to create a parts of speech annotated corpus in the clinical doma in that is comparable to the Penn Treebank and also represents the totality of the contemporary text as used in the clinical doma in. We also report the output of the TnT tagger tra ine d on the in it ia l 21,000 annotated sentences reaching a preliminary accuracy of above 96%.]"]},{"title":"1 Int roduc tio n","paragraphs":["Automated parts of speech (P oS) annotation have been an active field of research for more than 40 years now. Obvious ly, there are quite a few of tools already available with an impressive accuracy returns (Toutanova et al, 2003; Shen et al. , 2007; Spoustová et al., 2009; Søgaard, 2010). Th is is true in the general doma in text such as news reports or general domain articles. But when it comes to a niche area like clinical domain, no automated parts of speech taggers are readily available nor has there been any report of any such large corpus developed that meet the standards as set out in the general doma in. Interest has grown now as NLP is sought after in the clinical doma in, particularly f or the task of information extraction from c linical notes.","There have been previous attempts for creating PoS annotated corpus in the clinical doma in (Tateis i et al., 2004; Pakhomov et al, 2006; Albr ight et a l., 2013). All of these corpora are relatively small and the PoS taggers trained on them have not been shown to reach above 96% in the clinical doma in. Attempts at adapting a general doma in PoS tagger to work better for clinical domain include Easy Adapt (Daumé H., 2007) and C linAdapt (Ferraro et al., 2013). But none of these two adaptation methods enhance the accuracy levels to more than 95%.","Given that the text in clinical notes is radically different from what appears in the general domain, the general doma in E nglish PoS tagger models do not perform well on the clinical text. Our experi-ments with three such general domain taggers, namely Charniak (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) , Stanford (Klein and Manning, 2003) and OpenNLP, yielded not more than 95% accuracy. This motivated us to take a radical step of developing a fresh parts of speech annotated corpus comparable to the Penn Treebank. Well, we are aware that it is going to take a lot of money, time and effort. But we also believe that it is necessary if we need better NLP tools for this doma in."]},{"title":"2 The Representative Corpus","paragraphs":["To ensure that we have a representative corpus, we sampled a corpus of more than 750,000 documents from 119 pr oviders (hospita ls and specialty clinics). The biggest challenge was to take a representative sample of documents from various specialties and different work types. Thanks to the metadata information available in our interna l repository, this was solved in a rather easier way although we did need to look for infor mation on class ification and sub-c la s s if ic a tio n of the domain manua lly. 87 2.1 Sampling Task Out of these 750,000 documents, we selected only ten hospitals for document sampling as they were large providers with a greater number of note count and provided a diversity of the specialty doctors/providers dictating the c linical notes. These ten hospita ls amounted to a total of 237,110 documents written by 508 doctors of roughly 97 clinical specialties. A summary of this is given in Appendix A. 2.2 Se ntence Clus te ring We have used 237,110 documents for the process of selecting the sample sentences undergoing the PoS annotation. All of these documents were classified into different categories based on their work types (operative notes, admission notes, discharge summaries etc.), service line (cardiology, oncology, medic ine, ambulatory etc.), section headers (History of Present Illness, Chief Compla ints, Phys ical Examination, Laboratory Data etc.). Based on this classification, we have selected a sample of 10,000 documents fair ly representing the 237,110 documents selected in the first phase.","These 10,000 documents were parsed using the Charniak’s full syntactic parser (Charniak & Johnson, 2005). After some modif ications , the Charniak parser on clinical data gives an accuracy of about 95% at the PoS level. A graph based string similarity algorithm was used to find similar sentences from these 10,000 documents. A summary of what it yielded is as follow s :","Total Number of Sentences: 704,271","Total Nu mber of Unique Sentences: 365,518","Total Number of Unique Patterns: 234,909","The unique patterns were clustered together using a hierarchical c lustering a lgor ithm. Patterns were grouped together by calculating the Euclidean distance with a threshold similar ity of 80 or more. Follow ing this method, we got a total of 3,768 patterns that represented all of the unique patterns. We call them pattern heads.","By giving a proportional weightage to each of these pattern heads as per their occurrence in the unique patterns, we derived a total of 56,632 sentences. While no two sentences selected are same, about 41% of the patterns in the sample corpus have a frequency of more than 1.","Appendix B shows example pairs of sentences having the same tag pattern and Appendix C shows example pairs of sentences having s imilar pattern.","The final selected candidate sentences also contained quite a few junk sentences (which came of course from the clinical notes themselves) or some very frequent smaller patterns (e.g. date patterns), we manually removed them to get a total of 49,278 sentences with a total word count of 491,690 and an average per sentence word count of 9.97. The greatest number of token for a sentence was found to be 221 in the sampled corpus (while the same in the original, actual corpus is 395)."]},{"title":"3 Anno tatio n M e tho d","paragraphs":["As against the common practice of semi-automatic method of annotating text, we purposely chose to annotate the text from scratch. It has been reported that tools do affect the decisions of the annotators (Marcus et al., 1993). We asked the annotators to use simple notepad and for each of the tokens they had to key in the appropr iate PoS label. Tokenization and sentence boundary detection were automatically done before it went to the annotators.","As against the common practice of engaging annotators with a medical background and training them into linguistic annotation (Pakhomov et al., 2006; Fan et al., 2011) , we purposely chose to engage linguists and train them into medical language. The annotators were all graduate level researchers in ling u is t ic s and had a deep knowledge of theoretical s yntax. As next step in linguistics analysis after PoS tagging is syntactic parsing or chunking, the linguists were also motivated to learn about the goals of this task i.e. we informed them about our interests in developing a chunker and a parser afterwards. This information helps the annotators to think in terms of making syntactic tree while assigning a PoS tag. For example, there is always confusion among the tag pairs IN/RP, VBN/JJ and so on. But if one can try drawing a syntactic tree, the confusion gets cleared. While training annotators with medical background in linguistics for the task of PoS tagging may seem rather easy, the same cannot be said for syntactic tree formation. Besides, the linguists always had the choice of consulting medical experts 88 (medical coders, medical transcriptionists with more than 5 years of experience) in case any phrase had to be explained in terms of its meaning.","Training sessions were held for linguists for first 15 days during which differences were brought to fore and a consensus was reached. This period was strictly for training pur poses and text annotated dur ing this period was validated more than thrice before getting inc luded in the final corpus. After this tra in in g pe rio d, a n in te r-annotator agreement round was run with 10,000 sentences distr ibuted to four annotators in turn. Each f ile was annotated by at least two annotators. The differences were then compared and arbitrated by a third annotator who discussed the conflicting cases with the initia l annotators and brought a consensus among them.","Inter-annotator agreement at the start of this phase was 93% to 95%. This after a month increased to a consistent 97% to 100%. We are at the end of this phase and the accuracy is consistently c los e to 99%. Also of note is the fact that apart from the initial 5 days of face-to-face training session, the annotators never sit together and they work remotely from the convenience of their location and have a flexible time. We also ensured that they do not work long hours at a stretch doing this job as we know that this is a tedious job and cannot be done in a hurry. For a full-time annotator, the target goal was annotation of 1600 word per day (8 hours) and for the part-time annotators, it was half of that. T he y were always encouraged to come up with any issues for a weekly discussion on the conf licting or confusing cases.","For the later phases of annotation process, it is ensured tha t each annotation is validated by at least one other annotator. If disagreements arise, arbitration is done by involving a third annotator following a discussion.","As the text might contain tokenization errors, sentence boundary detection errors and other grammatical or typographical mistakes, the annotators are asked to document them in a separate spreadsheet. The sentences themselves are sacrosanct to the annotators and they can at the most make changes in separating the hyphenated words if they are not properly hyphenated by the tokenizer and document this change."]},{"title":"4 Anno tatio n G ui de li ne","paragraphs":["Barring a couple of new tags, the annotation guide line largely f ollows the Penn Treebank PoS annota-tio n guidelines (Santorini, B., 1990) and takes inputs from var ious other guide lines such as the Penn Treebank II parsing guide lines (Bies et a l. , 1995) and MiPACQ guidelines (Warne r e t a l. , 2012). A new tag that we have added on top of the Penn tagset looks for marking a difference between the expletive “it” and the pronomina l “it” as it helps in tasks like anaphora resolution. The new tag for the expletive use of ‘it’ is given as “EXP”. The tagset contains a total of 41 tags. The other four tags are HYPH, AFX, GW and XX. These tags are well described in the MiPACQ guideline.","As we have also seen the PoS labels given to the Penn Treebank data, we find that we are differing in assigning the tag to some of the words. For example, for the temporal expressions like “today”, “yesterday” and “tomorr ow”, the tag in Penn corpus is invar iably NN while we make a difference in their adverbial use and nomina l use and assign the tag accordingly as “RB” or “NN”."]},{"title":"5 Initia l Training Re sults","paragraphs":["After 4 months of annotation, we achieved a total of 21 thousand sentences annotated. For an experimental run, we trained a tagger to test how far we can go with this data. We implemented a modif ie d version of the TnT (Trigram and Tag) (Brants, 2000) a lgor ith m to train a PoS tagger. This tagger was given an input of 17,586 sentences containing a total of 158,330 words and was tested against 3,924 sentences containing a total of 38,143 words.","Without giving any extra features apart from the ones mentioned in Brants, we got a total of 2,621 sentences and 36,234 words annotated correctly. That is the TnT out-of-the-box accuracy was 95.00% as against the Charniak out-of-the-box accuracy of 91.36%.","We also compared the same test data against the Charniak parser (without the resource of tag dic-tio na ry and the ru le s). We find that the current tagger was actually performing better. Results improved by 0.33% if we modif ied the algor ithm to handle unknown words us ing suff ixes from the medical domain. These suffixes were collected specifically from the medical doma in and were such for which a single tag could be given. 89","We also experimented with another method for improvements. This inc luded us ing a dictionary of unambiguous words (words having s ing le ta gs inva ria b ly, for adjectives and verbs only) and resetting the emission probability to 1 for them. These two improvement techniques combined enhanced the results by 1.24% to push the accuracy to 96.24%.","Given that a fraction of our corpus is giving us 95% accuracy which is at par with or better than reported anywhere else for PoS tagging task in the doma in of c linical NLP, we believe that the results should only improve once we increase the tra in in g data and apply the impr ovement techniques available in the book."]},{"title":"6 Concl us io n","paragraphs":["There is a paucity of good and large enough annotated corpus in the domain of clinical NLP. The existing corpora are small although extensive analys is has been done on them. Our effort through this project is to fill the gap of having a large corpus comparable to the Penn Treebank.","In this paper we described an ongoing effort to create a sample corpus of clinical notes across most of the sub-domains and including a ll the different types of linguistic styles in this doma in. We have also used a novel method for creation of a representative corpus which can be said to represent the whole of the clinical text in current practice across providers within United States.","As compared to semi-automated methods of annotation practiced even in big corpus like the Penn Treebank, we are follow ing a fully manual process of annotation where the annotators are only given contextual information and no other help or props a re provided apart from the guidelines to fasten the annotation process. We obtain an inter-annotator agreement of 98.93 and we believe that this is the best approach to go for this task.","Using the basic TnT algor ithm we a ls o train a tagger using 30% of our data (17,500 sentences) annotated in the initial 3 months of the project and achieve a baseline accuracy of 95%. We expect that our accuracy should improve to more than 98% once we train the same algor ithm on all the 50,000 annotated sentences.","After the completion of the project, we may release this corpus for research use."]},{"title":"Ackno wle dge me nts","paragraphs":["We acknowledge the contr ibution of the linguists at JNU, New Delhi namely, O inam Nganthoibi, Gayetri Thakur , Shila ditya Bhattacharya and Srishti Singh.
