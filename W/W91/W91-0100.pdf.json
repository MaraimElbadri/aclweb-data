Intuitively we feel that it should be possible to propose a set of rules and/or principles which would define the class of well-formed expressions of a given language independently of any particular task. Despite the variety of linguistic theories available today this result remained elusive, until recently. In the past few years, however, there has been an increasing interest in reversible grammar research, and some significant new results have emerged. This workshop is the first international m~eting entirely devoted to the problems of reversible grammar in natural language processing as seen from various viewpoints: theoretical linguistics, computational linguistics and computer science.","I would like to take this opportunity to thank all these authors who submitted papers of such high quality, for it is they who have made this meeting possible. I am of course especially grateful to the Program Committee, Marc Dymetman, Patrick Saint-Dizier and Gertjan van Noord, for their careful reviewing of the papers, and their invaluable help in organizing this workshop. We are also particularly indebted to Martin Kay, the keynote speaker, for adding a special sparkle to our meeting.","This meeting of course would not be possible without generous help from the Association for Computational Linguistics, particularly Don Walker, Peter Norvig and Ralph Grishman. The :workshop has been sponsored by the Special Interest Groups on Generation (SIGGEN)and Parsing (SIGPARSE), and my special thanks go to Karen Kukich, Marie Meteer, and Masaru Tomita. Financial support has been provided by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the National Science Foundation under grants to New York University.
