The Tamajaq language 1.1 Socio-linguistic situation","paragraphs":["In Niger, the official language is French and there are eleven national languages. Five are taught in a experimental schools: Fulfulde, Hausa, Kanuri, Tamajaq and Soŋay-Zarma. According to the last census in 1998, the Tamajaq language is spoken by 8,4% of the 13.5 million people who live in Niger. This language is also spoken in Mali, Burkina-Faso, Algeria and Libya. It is estimated there are around 5 millions Tamajaq-speakers around the world. The Tamacheq language belongs to the group of Berber languages. 1.2 Tamajaq alphabet The Tamajaq alphabet used in Niger (Republic of Niger, 1999) uses 41 characters, 14 with diacritical marks that all figure in the Unicode standard (See appendix A). There are 12 vowels: a, â, ă, ə, e, ê, i, î, o, ô, u, û. 1.3 Articulary phonetics Consonants Voiceless Voiced Bilabial Plosive b Nasal m Trill r Semivowel w Labiodental Fricative f Dental Plosive t d Fricative s z Nasal n Lateral l Pharyngeal Plosive ṭ ḍ Fricative ṣ ẓ Lateral ḷ Palatal Plosive c ǰ Fricative š j Semivowel y Velar Plosive k g, ğ Fricative ɣ x Nasal ŋ Glottal Plosive q","Fricative h Table 1a: Articulary phonetics of Tamajaq consonants 81 Vowels Close Close-mid Open-mid Open Palatal i e Central ə a a","Labial u o Table 1b: Articulary phonetics of Tamajaq vowels 1.4 Tools on computers There are no specific TALN tools for the Tamajaq language.

It was written by the SOUTEBA1","project of the DED2","organisation in 2006. Because it targets children, this dictionary consists only of 5,390 entries. Words have been chosen by compiling school books. 2.1 Structure of an entry","Each entry generally details : - lemma, - lexical category, - translation in French, - an example, - gender (for nouns), - plural form (for nouns).

There are monoliteral, biliteral triliteral, quadriliteral verbs... Three moods are distinguished: imperative, simple injunctive and intense injunctive. Three aspects present different possible values: - accomplished: intense or negative; 82 - non accomplished: simple, intense or negative; - aorist future: simple or negative. Examples : əktəb (to write): triliteral verb, type 1. əṣṣən (to know): triliteral verb, type 2 (ṣṣn). əməl (to say): biliteral verb, type 1 akər (to steal): biliteral verb, type 2 awəy (to carry): biliteral verb, type 3 ašwu (to drink): biliteral verb, type 4 aru (to love): monoliteral verb, type 2 aru (to open): monoliteral verb, type 3 Each class of verb has its own rules of conjugation. 3.2 Nominal morphology a. Simple nouns Nouns present three characteristics: - gender: masculine or feminine; - number: singular or plural; - annexation state is marked by the change of the first vowel.

Its plural is \"ǝṭrǝkkatăn\". It becomes \"ǝṭrǝkka\" when annexation state is expressed. The plural form of nouns is not regular and has to be specifically listed. b. Complex nouns Complex nouns are composed by several lexical units connected together by hyphens. It could include nouns, determiners or prepositions as well as verbs.","Examples:","Noun +determiner + noun \"ejaḍ-n-əjḍan\", literally means \"donkey of birds\" (this is the name of a bird).","Verb + noun \"awəy-əhuḍ\" literally means \"it follows harmattan\" (kite). \"gaẓẓay-təfuk\" literally means \"it looks at sun\" (sunflower).","Preposition + noun \"In-tamaṭ\" means \"the one of the tree acacia\" (of acacia).","Verb + verb \"azəl-azəl\" means \"run run\" (return). We counted 238 complex nouns in the studied dictionary."]},{"title":"4 Natural Language Processing of Tamajaq 4.1 Nooj software (Silberztein, 2007)","paragraphs":["« Nooj is a linguistic development environment that includes tools to create and maintain largecoverage lexical resources, as well as morphological and syntactic grammars. » This software is specifically designed for linguists who can use it to test hypothesis on real corpus. « Dictionaries and grammars are applied to texts in order to locate morphological, lexical and syntactic patterns and tag simple and compound words. » Nooj put all possible tags for each token or group of tokens but does not disambiguate between the multiple possibilities. However, the user can build his own grammar to choose between the multiple possible tags. The analysis can be displayed as a syntactic tree. This software is supported by Windows. We chose to construct resources for this software because it is fully compatible with Unicode. 4.2 Construction of the dictionary We convert the edited dictionary for the Nooj software. 3,463 simple nouns, 128 complex nouns, 46 adjectives and 33 verbo-nouns are given with their plural form. Annexation state is indicated for 987 83 nouns, 23 complex nouns, 2 adjectives and 7 verbo-nouns. We created morphological rules that we expressed as Perl regular expressions and also in the Nooj format (with the associated tag). a. Annexation state rules Thirteen morphological rules calculate the annexation state.","Examples: The 'A1ă' rule replaces the first letter of the word by 'ă'. 'A1ă' rule Nooj <LW><S>ă/sfss Perl .̂(.*)$ → ă$1","Table 4: Rule 'A1ă' The 'A2 ' rule replaces the second letter ofǝ the word by ' '.ǝ 'A2 ' ruleǝ Nooj A2 =<LW><R><S> /sfssǝ ǝ","Perl (̂.).(.*)$ → $1 $2ǝ Table 5: Rule 'A2 'ǝ b. Plural form rules We searched formal rules to unify the calculation of plural forms. We found 126 rules that fit from 2 up to 446 words. 2932 words could be associated with, at least, one flexional rule. Examples: 'I4' rule deletes the last letter, adds \"-ăn\" at the end and \"i-\" at the beginning. Nooj I4=ăn<LW><S>i/Iget Perl (̂.*).$ → i$1ăn","# 446 words Table 6: Rule 'I4' 'I2' rule deletes the last and the second letters and includes \"-en\" at the end and \"-i-\" in the second position. Nooj I2=<B>en<LW><R><S>i/Iget Perl (̂.).(.*).$ → $1i$2en","# 144 words Table 7: Rule 'I2' 'I45' rule deletes the final letter and include \"-en\" at the end. Nooj I45=<B>en/Iget Perl (̂.*).$ → <B>en/Iget","# 78 words Table 8: Rule 'I45' 'I102' rule deletes the two last letters and the second one and includes a final \"-a\" and a \"-i-\" in the second position. Nooj I102=<B2>a<LW><R><S>i/Iget Perl (̂.).(.*)..$ → $1i$2a","# 6 words Table 9: Rule 'I102' c. Combined rules When it was necessary, the above rules have been combined to calculate singular and plural forms with or without annexation state. We thus finally obtained 319 rules. Example: I2RA2ă =",":Rwdk + :I2 + :Rwdk :A2ă + :I2 :A2ă Fig. 1: Rule I2RA2ă This rule recognizes the singular form (:Rwdk), the plural form (:I2), the singular form with the annexation state (:Rwdk :A2ă) and the plural form with the annexation state (:I2 :A2ă). 25 words meet this rule. For instance, \"taḍlǝmt\" (accusation, provocation), is inflected in: - taḍlǝmt,taḍlǝmt,SN+tnt+wdk - tiḍlǝmen,taḍlǝmt,SN+tnt+Iget - tăḍlǝmen,taḍlǝmt,SN+tnt+Iget+sfss 84 - tăḍlǝmt,taḍlǝmt,SN+tnt+wdk+sfss d. Conjugaison rules Verb classes are not indicated in the dictionary. We only describe a few conjugaison rules, just to check the expressivity of the Nooj software Here is the rule of the verb \"əṣṣən\" (to know), intense accomplished aspect, represented as a transducer. Fig. 2: Verb \"əṣṣən\", intense accomplished aspect We obtain, in the inflected dictionary, the correct conjugated forms. əṣṣanaɣ+əṣṣən,V+accompli+wdk+1 təṣṣanaɣ+əṣṣən,V+accompli+wdk+2 iṣṣan+əṣṣən,V+accompli+wdk+yy+3 təṣṣan+əṣṣən,V+accompli+wdk+tnt+3 nəṣṣan+əṣṣən,V+accompli+gt+1 təṣṣanam+əṣṣən,V+accompli+gt+yy+2 təṣṣanmat+əṣṣən,V+accompli+gt+tnt+2 əṣṣanan+əṣṣən,V+accompli+gt+yy+3 əṣṣannat+əṣṣən,V+accompli+gt+tnt+3 e. Irregular words Finally, the singular and plural forms of 2,457 words were explicitly written in the Nooj dictionary because they do not follow any regular rule. Examples: Singular Plural Translation ag-awnaf kel-awnaf tourist aman oẓ imen aẓ young animal","ănaffarešši in ff r ššaǝ ǝ ǝ someboby with bad mood ănesbehu in sbuhaǝ liar efange ifangăyan bank efajanfăj ifajanfă ănɣ sling emagărmăz imagămăzăn plant emazzăle imazzaletăn singer","ta aggaltḍ ti ulenḍ daugther-in-law","tejăṭ tiz enḍ goal (football) Table 10: Examples of irregular plural forms f. Result There are 6,378 entries in the Nooj dictionary. The inflected dictionary, calculated from the above dictionary and with the inflectional and conjugation rules, encounters 11,223 entries. Nooj is able to use the electronic dictionary we've created to automatically tag a text (see an example in appendix B). 4.3 Future work a Conversion into XML format We will convert the inflectional dictionary into the international standard Lexical Markup Framework format (Francopoulo and al., 2006) in order to make it easily usable by other TALN application,. b Automatic search of rules Due to the high morphological complexity of the Tamajaq language, we plan to develop a Perl program that would automatically determine the derivational and conjugation rules. c Completion and correction of the resource The linguistic resource will be completed during the next months in order to add the class of verbs that are absent for the moment, and also to correct the errors that we noticed during this study. d Enrichment of the resource We plan to construct a corpus of school texts to evaluate the out-of-vocabulary rate of this dictionary. This corpus could then be used to enrich the dictionary. The information given by Nooj would be useful to choose the words to add. 85"]},{"title":"Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["Special thanks to John Johnson, reviewer of this text."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Aghali-Zakara M. 1996.
