Bretonnel Cohen, Dina Demner-Fushman, Sophia Ananiadou, John Pestian, Jun’ichi Tsujii, and Bonnie Webber 1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Yearly BioNLP workshops have been held in conjunction with Association for Computational Linguistics and North American Association for Computational Linguistics conferences since 2002. Whereas other venues, such as NLP sessions at biomedical informatics and computational biology meetings, provide excellent opportunities for presenting applications of NLP in the biomedical domain, the ACL BioNLP workshop has become the venue that is most characterized by representation of work in a wide variety of areas of NLP. The BioNLP workshop has consistently been a venue for presenting work that is innovative, novel, and challenging from an NLP perspective. In addition to providing a venue for fundamental BioNLP research, this workshop exposes BioNLP researchers to the latest achievements in other NLP areas and facilitates dissemination of knowledge acquired in the BioNLP domain to the wider NLP community. Compared to previous years, BioNLP 2009 was novel in two ways. The first is that it is the first workshop since formation of the SIGBIOMED Association for Computational Linguistics Special Interest Group. The second is that for the first time, there was a shared task associated with the workshop. This shared task is documented in a separate proceedings volume."]},{"title":"2 Submissions, acceptance rate, and themes","paragraphs":["The workshop received 29 submissions, of which twelve were accepted as full papers and an additional twelve were accepted as posters. A number of themes were evident in this year’s papers and posters. Lexical semantics was especially well-represented this year, with papers on ontology selection [10], lexicon construction [12], and synonymy [3]. Information extraction was also well-represented, with papers in this area tackling both the genomic [2, 8], and the clinical [1] domain. This included work that is novel in the biomedical domain in terms of dealing with speech and with the dental domain [1]. This year also saw continued work on contextual issues in biomedical text mining [6, 7]. Finally, the program was rounded out with work on a new formulation of the named entity recognition problem [11], the hot topic of species identification [5], and word sense disambiguation [9] and summarization [4]."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The greatest debt owed by the organizers of a workshop like this is to the authors who graciously chose BioNLP 2009 as the venue in which to share the fruits of the countless hours of research that went into the work submitted for consideration. The next-biggest debt is, without question, to the many program committee 1iii members (listed elsewhere in this volume); they produced three reviews per paper on a tight review schedule and with an admirable level of insight. Finally, we acknowledge the gracious sponsorship of the Computational Medicine Center and Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] Lee Christensen, Henk Harkema, Peter Haug, Jeannie Irwin, and Wendy Chapman.
