While the domain-oriented semantic structures are direct targets of Text Mining (TM), their extraction from text is not straghtforward due to the diversity of linguistic expressions. The extraction of linguistically-oriented semactics is more straghtforward, and has been studied independentely of specific domains. In order to find a use of the domain-independent research achievements for TM, we aim at linking classes of the two types of semantics. The classes were connected by analyz-ing linguistically-oriented semantics of the expressions that mention one biological class. With the obtained relationship between the classes, we discuss a link between TM and linguistically-oriented semantics."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["This paper compares the linguistically-oriented and domain-oriented semantics of the GENIA event corpus, and suggests a factor for utilizing NLP techniques for Text Mining (TM) in the bio-medical domain.","The increasing number of scientific articles in the bio-medical domain has contributed in drawing considerable attention to NLP-based TM. An important step in NLP-based TM is obtaining the domain-oriented semantics of sentences, as shown at the bottom of figure 1. The BioInfer (Pyysalo et al., 2007) and the GENIA event corpus (Kim et al., 2008) provide annotations of such semantic structures on collections of bio-medical articles. Domain-oriented semantic structures are valuable assets because their representation suits information needs in the domain; however, the extraction of such structures is difficult due to the large gap between the text and these structures.","On the other hand, the extraction of linguistically-oriented semantics from text has long been studied in computational linguistics, and has recently been formalized as Semantic Role Labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and semantic structure extraction (Baker et al., 2007)(Surdeanu et al., 2008). Semantic structures in such tasks are exemplified in the middle of figure 1. The linguistically-oriented semantic structures are easier to extract, although the information is not practical to the domain.","We aim at relating linguistically-oriented frames of semantics with domain-oriented classes, thus making a step forward in utilizing the computational linguistic resources for the bio-medical TM. Of all the differences in the two type of semantics, we focused on the fact that the former frames are more sensitive to the perspective imposed by the sentence writer. In the right hand-side example of figure 1, the linguistically-oriented structure treats PBMC, a cell entity, as an agent; however the bio-medical structure reflects the scientific view that there are no agents, objects acting with intention, in bio-molecular phenomena.","As a preliminary investigation, we selected four representative classes of bio-molecular phenomena; Localization, Binding, Cell adhesion, and Gene expression, and investigated domain-oriented annotations for the classes in the GENIA 162 â, whereas in many other cell types, NF-kappa B TRANSLOCATES from cytosol to nucleus as a result of â â, both C3a and C3a(desArg) were found to enhance IL-6 RELEASE by PBMC in a dose-dependent manner.

Expressions mentioning the four classes were examined and manually classified into linguistically-oriented frames, represented by those defined in FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998). FN frames associated to a bio-molecular event class constitute a list of possible perspectives in mentioning phenomena of the class.","The rest of this paper is structured in the following way: Section 2 reviews the existing work on semantic structures and expression varieties in the bio-medical domain, and provides a comparison to our work. In section 3, we describe the GENIA event corpus, and the FrameNet frames used as linguistically-oriented classes in our investigation. Sections 4 and 5 explain the methods and results of the corpus investigation; in particular the sections in-vestigate how the linguistic frames were associated to the domain-oriented classes of semantics. Finally, we provide discussion and conclusion in section 6 and 7."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Existing work on semantics approached domain-oriented semantic structures from linguistically-oriented semantics. In contrast, our approach uses domain-oriented semantics to find the linguistic semantics that represent them. We believe that the two different approaches could complement each other.","The PASbio(Wattarujeekrit et al., 2004) proposes Predicate Argument Structures (PASs), a type of linguistically-oriented semantic structures, for domain-specific lexical items, based on PASs defined in PropBank(Wattarujeekrit et al., 2004) and NomBank(Meyers et al., 2004). The PASs are defined per lexical item, and is therefore distinct from a biologically-oriented representation of events. (Cohen et al., 2008) investigated syntactic alternations of verbs and their nominalized forms which occurred in the PennBioIE corpus(Kulick et al., 2004), whilst keeping PASs of the PASBio in their minds.","The BioFrameNet(Dolbey et al., 2006) is an at-tempt to extend the FrameNet with specific frames to the bio-medical domain, and to apply the frames to corpus annotation. Our attempts were similar, in that both were: 1) utilizing the FN frames or their extensions to classify mentions of biological events, and 2) relating the frames and the FEs (roles of participants) with classes in domain ontologies; e.g. the Gene Ontology(Ashburner et al., 2000).","As far as the authors know, it is the first at-tempt to explicitly address the problem of linking linguistically-oriented and domain-oriented frames of semantics. However, it has been indirectly studied through works on TM or Relation Extraction using linguistically-oriented semantic structures as features, such as in the case with (Harabagiu et al., 2005)."]},{"title":"3 Corpora","paragraphs":["yWe used domain-oriented annotations of the GENIA event corpus and linguistically-oriented frames defined in FrameNet (FN), to link domain-oriented and linguistically-oriented frames of semantics.

The annotation was completed for all mentions of biological events, and resulted in 6,114 identified events. Examples of annotated event structures are shown at the bottom of figure 1. Each structure has attributes type and themes, which respectively show the biological class of the mentioned event and phrases expressing the event participants. The event classes are defined based on the terms in the Gene Ontology. For example, the Localization class in the GENIA event corpus is defined as an equivalent of the GO term Localization (GO0051179). The event classifications used in the corpus are depicted in the left hand-side of figure 2. Arrows in the figure depict the inheritance relations defined in the GENIA event ontology. For instance, the Localization class is defined as a type of Physiological process. Each of the annotated structures has additional attributes that point phrases that the annotator of the structure used as a clue. Among the attributes, the clueType attribute shows a clue phrase to the event class. In our investigation, the attribute was treated as a predicate, or an equivalent of the lexical unit in the FN.","FN is a network of frames that are are linguistically-oriented classifications of semantics. A FN frame is defined as “a script-like conceptual structure that describes a particular type of situation, object, or event and the participants and propositions involved in it,” and is associated with words, or lexical units, evoking the frame. For instance, the verbs move, go and fly are lexical units of the Motion frame, and they share the same semantic structure. Each FN frame has annotation examples form-ing an attestation of semantic overlap between the lexical units. Additionally, FN defines several types of frame-frame relations; e.g. inheritance, precedence, subframe, etc. The right hand-side of figure 2 shows some FN frames and inheritance relationships between them. The FN provides linguistically-oriented classifications of event mentions based on surface expressions, and also shows abstract relations between the frames."]},{"title":"4 Additional Annotation","paragraphs":["Our aim is to link linguistically-oriented and domain-oriented frames of the bio-medical text’s semantics.

First, we collected linguistic expressions that mention each of the selected GENIA event classes from the GENIA event corpus. We then sampled and annotated them with their linguistically-oriented semantics which conformed to the FrameNet. 4.1 Target Classes and Keywords We concentrated mainly on the mentions of four GENIA classes; Localization, Binding, Cell adhesion, and Gene expression. Gene expression, Binding, and Localization are three of the most frequent four classes in the GENIA event corpus.1","Binding and Localization are the two most primitive molecular events. The Cell adhesion class was included as a comparison for the Binding class.","Counting keywords for mentioning events was close to automatic. We extracted phrases pointed by a clueType attribute from each event structure. We then tokenized the phrases, performed a simple stemming on the tokens, and counted the resulting words. The stemming process simply replaced each inflected word to its stem by consulting a small list of inflected words with their stems. Manual work was only used in making the small list. 4.2 FN Annotation A major challenge encountered in annotating a sampled expression with a semantic structure conforming to FN, was in the assignment of a FN frame to","1","Except correlation and regulation classes which express relational information rather than events. the mention. Our decision was based on the following four points: 1) keywords used in the mention, 2) description of FN frames, 3) syntactic positions of the event participants, and 4) frame-frame relations.","The first indicates that a FN frame became a candidate frame for the mention, if the keyword in the mention is a lexical unit of the FN frame. FN frames and their lexical units could be easily checked by consulting the FN dictionary. If there were no entries for the keyword in the dictionary, synonyms or words in the keyword’s definition were used. For example, the verb translocate has no entries in the FN dictionary, and the frames for verbs such as move were used instead.","For the second point, we discarded FN frames that are either evoked by a completely different sense of the keyword, or too specific of a non-biological situations.","Before we assigned a FN frame to each mention, we manually examined the syntactic positions of all event participants present in the sampled GENIA mentions. Combinations of the syntactic position and event participants observed for a keyword were compared with sample annotations of the candidate FN frames.","We checked frame-frame relations between the candidate frames, because they can be regarded as evidence that shows that the conception of the frames is related.

The resulting relationships between FN frames and the four GENIA classes demonstrate a gap between linguistically-oriented and domain-oriented classification of events, as shown in figure 2.","The relations can be explained by decomposing it into two cases: 1) 1-to-n mappings, and 2) n-to-1 mappings. The n-to-n mapping from GENIA to FN can then be regarded as a mix of the two cases. In the following sections, the two cases are described in detail. Further, we show conversion examples of a FN structure to a GENIA event structure, which were supported by the obtained GENIA participant-FN participant relations.","5.1 1-to-N Mapping: Different Perspectives on the Same Phenomena A 1-to-n mapping from GENIA to FN can be explained as the case where the same molecular phenomena are expressed from different perspectives. 5.1.1 Binding Expressed in Multiple frames","The Binding class in GENIA is defined as “the selective, often stoichiometric interaction of a molecule with one or more specific sites on another molecule.” We associated the class with three frames, and two frames of the three, Attaching and Becoming frames, represent different perspectives for mentioning the class.

Our preliminary result illustrates the gap between the two type of semantics, and a relationship between them. We discuss development of a Text Mining (TM) system, in association with the extraction of linguistically-oriented semantics, which has been studied independently of TM.","First, our result would show that TM involves at least two qualitatively different tasks. One task is related to our results; that is, recognizing equivalent events which are expressed from different perspectives, and hence expressed by using different linguistic frames, and at the same time distinguish-ing event mentions which share the same linguistic frame but belong to different domain classes. Our investigation indicates that this task is mainly dependent on domain knowledge and how a phenomenon can be conceptualized. Another task of TM is the extraction of linguistically-oriented semantics, which basically maps various syntactic realizations to the shared structures. In order to develop a TM system, we need to solve the two difficult tasks.","Second, TM could benefit from linguistically-oriented frames by using them as an intermediating layer between text and domain-oriented information. The domain-oriented semantic structures, which is a target of TM, are inevitably dependent on the domain. On the other hand, the extraction of linguistically-oriented semantics from text is less dependent. Therefore, using the linguistically-oriented structure could be favorable to domain portability of a TM system.","Our aim was explicitly linking linguistically-oriented and domain-oriented semantics of the bio-molecular articles, and the preliminary result show the possibility of the extraction of linguistically-oriented semantics contributing to TM. Further investigation of the relationship would be a important step forward for TM in the bio-molecular domain.","Our investigation was preliminary. For example, conversions from FN structures to GENIA event structures, depicted in figures 4 and 5, were based on manual investigation. Further, they were attested by limited samples in the corpus. For our results to contribute to a TM system, evaluation of the conversions and automatic extraction of such conversions must be considered."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper presents a relationship of domain-oriented and linguistically-oriented frames of semantics, obtained by an investigation of the GENIA event corpus. In the investigation, we annotated sample sentences from the GENIA event corpus with linguistically-oriented semantic structures as those of FrameNet, and compared them with domain-oriented semantic annotations that the corpus originally possesses. The resulting relations between the domain-oriented and linguistically-oriented frames suggest that mentions of a biological phenomenon could be realized in a number of linguistically-oriented frames, and that the linguistically-oriented frames represent possible perspectives in mentioning the phenomenon. The resulting relations would illustrate a challenge in developing a Text Mining system, and would indicate importance of linguistically-oriented frames as an intermediating layer between text and domain-oriented information. Our future plan includes evaluation of our conversions from a linguistically-oriented to a domain-oriented structure, and automatic extraction of such conversions. 169"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["M.
