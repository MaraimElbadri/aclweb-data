This opportunity has been significantly expanded with the 2009 CoNLL shared task on syntactic and semantic parsing of seven languages (Hajič et al., 2009) belonging to several different language families.","We participate in this task with a generative, history-based model proposed in the CoNLL 2008","0","Authors in alphabetical order. shared task for English (Henderson et al., 2008) and further improved to tackle non-planar dependencies (Titov et al., 2009). This model maximises the joint probability of the syntactic and semantic dependencies and thereby enforces that the output structure be globally coherent, but the use of synchronous parsing allows it to maintain separate structures for the syntax and semantics. The probabilistic model is based on Incremental Sigmoid Belief Networks (IS-BNs), a recently proposed latent variable model for syntactic structure prediction, which has shown very good performance for both constituency (Titov and Henderson, 2007a) and dependency parsing (Titov and Henderson, 2007b). The use of latent variables enables this architecture to be extended to learning a synchronous parse of syntax and semantics with-out overly restrictive assumptions about the linking between syntactic and semantic structures.","In this work, we evaluate the ability of this method to generalise across several languages. We take the model as it was developed for English, and apply it directly to all seven languages. The only fine-tuning was to evaluate whether to include one feature type which we had previously found did not help for English, but helped overall. No other feature engineering was done. The use of latent variables to induce features automatically from the data gives our method the adaptability necessary to per-form well across all seven languages, and demonstrates the lack of language specificity in the models of Henderson et al. (2008) and Titov et al. (2009).","The main properties of this model, that differentiate it from other approaches, is the use of synchronous syntactic and semantic derivations and the 37 use of online planarisation of crossing semantic dependencies. This system was ranked third overall with a macro averaged F1 score of 82.14%, only 0.5% worse than the best system."]},{"title":"2 The Synchronous Model","paragraphs":["The use of synchronous parsing allows separate structures for syntax and semantics, while still modeling their joint probability. We use the approach to synchronous parsing proposed in Henderson et al. (2008), where we start with two separate derivations specifying each of the two structures, then synchronise these derivations at each word. The individual derivations are based on Nivre’s shift-reduce-style parsing algorithm (Nivre et al., 2006), as discussed further below. First we illustrate the high-level structure of the model, discussed in more detail in Henderson et al. (2008).","Let Td be a syntactic dependency tree with derivation D1","d, ..., D md d , and Ts be a semantic","dependency graph with derivation D1","s , ..., Dms","s .","To define derivations for the joint structure","Td, Ts, we divide the two derivations into the","chunks between shifting each word onto the","stack, ct","d = D bt d d , ..., D et d d and ct","s = D bt s s , ..., D et s s , where D bt d−1 d = D bt s−1 s = Shiftt−1 and D et d+1 d = D","et","s+1","s = Shiftt. Then the actions of the synchronous derivations consist of quadruples Ct","= (ct","d, Switch, ct","s, Shiftt), where Switch means switching from syntactic to semantic mode. This gives us the following joint probability model, where n is the number of words in the input.

The probability of ct","d is de-","composed into one probability for each derivation","action Di",", conditioned on its history using the chain","rule, and likewise for ct","s. These probabilities are es-","timated using the method described in section 3.","Syn cross Sem cross Sem tree No parse Cat 0% 0% 61.4% 0% Chi 0% 28.0% 28.6% 9.5% Cze 22.4% 16.3% 6.1% 1.8% Eng 7.6% 43.9% 21.4% 3.9% Ger 28.1% 1.3% 97.4% 0.0% Jap 0.9% 38.3% 11.2% 14.4% Spa 0% 0% 57.1% 0% Table 1: For each language, percentage of training sentences with crossing arcs in syntax and semantics, with semantic arcs forming a tree, and which were not parsable using the Swap action.","One of the main characteristics of our synchronous representation, unlike other synchronous representations of syntax and semantics (Nesson et al., 2008), is that the synchronisation is done on words, rather than on structural components. We take advantage of this freedom and adopt different methods for handling crossing arcs for syntax and for semantics.","While both syntax and semantics are represented as dependency graphs, these graphs differ substantially in their properties. Some statistics which in-dicate these differences are shown in table 1. For example, English syntactic dependencies form trees, while semantic dependency structures are only trees 21.4% of the time, since in general each structure does not form a connected graph and some nodes may have more than one parent. The syntactic dependency structures for only 7.6% of English sentences contain crossing arcs, while 43.9% of the semantic dependency structures contain crossing arcs. Due to variations both in language characteristics and annotation decisions across corpora, these differences between syntax and semantics vary across the seven languages, but they are consistent enough to motivate the development of new techniques specifically for handling semantic dependency structures. In particular, we use a different method for parsing crossing arcs.","For parsing crossing semantic arcs (i.e. non-planar graphs), we use the approach proposed in Titov et al. (2009), which introduces an action Swap that swaps the top two elements on the parser’s stack. The Swap action allows the parser to reorder words online during the parse. This allows words to be processed in different orders during different 38 portions of the parse, so some arcs can be specified using one ordering, then other arcs can be specified using another ordering. Titov et al. (2009) found that only using the Swap action as a last resort is the best strategy for English (compared to using it preemptively to address future crossing arcs) and we use the same strategy here for all languages.","Syntactic graphs do not use a Swap action. We adopt the HEAD method of Nivre and Nils-son (2005) to de-projectivise syntactic dependencies outside of parsing.1"]},{"title":"3 Features and New Developments","paragraphs":["The synchronous derivations described above are modelled with a type of Bayesian Network called an Incremental Sigmoid Belief Network (ISBN) (Titov and Henderson, 2007a). As in Henderson et al. (2008), the ISBN model distinguishes two types of latent states: syntactic states, when syntactic decisions are considered, and semantic states, when semantic decision are considered. Latent states are vectors of binary latent variables, which are conditioned on variables from previous states via a pattern of connecting edges determined by the previous decisions. These latent-to-latent connections are used to engineer soft biases which reflect the relevant do-mains of locality in the structure being built. For these we used the set of connections proposed in Titov et al. (2009), which includes latent-to-latent connections both from syntax states to semantics states and vice versa. The latent variable vectors are also conditioned on a set of observable features of the derivation history. For these features, we start with the feature set from Titov et al. (2009), which extends the semantic features proposed in Henderson et al. (2008) to allow better handling of the non-planar structures in semantics. Most importantly, all the features previously included for the top of the stack were also included for the word just under the top of the stack. To this set we added one more type of feature, discussed below.","We made some modifications to reflect differences in the task definition between the 2008 and 2009 shared tasks, and experimented with one type of features which had been previously imple-1 The statistics in Table 1 suggest that, for some languages,","swapping might be beneficial for syntax as well. mented. For the former modifications, the system was adapted to allow the use of the PFEAT and FILLPRED fields in the data, which both resulted in improved accuracy for all the languages. The PFEAT data field (automatically predicted morphological features) was introduced in the system in two ways, as an atomic feature bundle that is predicted when predicting the word, and split into its elementary components when conditioning on a previous word, as was done in Titov and Henderson (2007b). Because the testing data included a specification of which words were annotated as predicates (the FILLPRED data field), we constrained the parser’s output so as to be consistent with this specification. For rare predicates, if the predicate was not in the parser’s lexicon (extracted from the training set), then a sense was taken from the list of senses reported in the Lexicon and Frame Set resources available for the closed challenge. If this information was not available, then a default sense was constructed based on the automatically predicted lemma (PLEMMA) of the predicate.","We also made use of a previously implemented type of feature that allows the prediction of a semantic link between two words to be conditioned on the syntactic dependency already predicted between the same two words. While this feature had previously not helped for English, it did result in an overall improvement across the languages.","Also, in comparison with previous experiments, the search beam used in the decoding phase was in-creased from 50 to 80, producing a small improvement in the overall development score.","All development effort took about two personmonths, mostly by someone who had no previous experience with the system. Most of this time was spent on the above differences in the task definition between the 2008 and 2009 shared tasks."]},{"title":"4 Results and Discussion","paragraphs":["We participated in the joint task of the closed challenge, as described in Hajič et al.

In table 5, we show our rankings across the different datasets, amongst systems submitted for the same task.","The overall score used to rank systems is the unweighted average of the syntactic labeled accuracy and the semantic labeled F1 measure, across all languages (“macro F1” in table 2). We were ranked third, out of 14 systems. There was only a 0.5% difference between our score and that of the best system, while there was a 1.29% difference between our score and the fourth ranked system. Only considering syntactic accuracy, we had the highest average score of all systems, with the highest individual score for Catalan, Czech, and Spanish. Only considering semantic F1, we were again ranked third. Our results for out-of-domain data (table 3) achieved a similar level of success, although here we were ranked second for average syntactic accuracy. Our precision on semantic arcs was generally much better than our recall (shown in table 4). However, other systems had a similar imbalance, resulting in no change in our third place ranking for semantic precision and for semantic recall. Only when the semantic precision is averaged with syntactic accuracy do we squeeze into second place (“macro Prec”).","To get a more detailed picture of the strengths and weaknesses of our system, we computed its rank within each dataset, shown in table 5. Overall, our system is robust across languages, with little fluctuation in ranking for the overall score, including for out-of-domain data.

The other ranks for English out-of-domain and English in-domain scores are also on the poor side. These results support our claim that our parser has not undergone much handtuning, since it was originally developed for English. It is not currently clear whether this relative difference reflects a English-specific weakness in our system, or that many of the other systems have been fine-tuned for English.","On the higher end of our dataset rankings, we do relatively well on Catalan, Czech, and Spanish. Catalan and Spanish are unique amongst these datasets in that they have no crossing arcs in their semantic structure. Czech seems to have semantic structures which are relatively well handled by our derivations with Swap. As indicated above in table 1, only 2% of sentences are unparsable, despite 16% requiring the Swap action. However, this argument does not explain why our parser did relatively poorly on German semantic dependencies. Regardless, these observations would suggest that our system is still having trouble with crossing dependencies, despite the introduction of the Swap operation, and that our learning method could achieve better performance with an improved treatment of crossing semantic dependencies.","Table 6 shows how accuracies and training times vary with the size of the training dataset, for Czech and English.

This model provides a single generative probability of the joint syntactic and semantic dependency structures, but allows separate representations for these two structures by parsing the two structures synchronously. Finding the statistical correlations both between and within these structures is facilitated through the use of latent variables, which induce features automatically from the data, thereby greatly reducing the need for hand-coded feature engineering.","This latent variable model proved very robust across languages, achieving a ranking of between second and fourth on each language, including for out-of-domain data. The extent to which the parser does not rely on hand-crafting is underlined by the fact that its worst ranking is for English, the language for which it was developed (particularly for out-of-domain data). The parser was ranked third overall out of 14 systems, with a macro averaged F1 score of 82.14%, only 0.5% worse than the best system.","Both joint learning and conditioning decisions about semantic dependencies on latent representations of syntactic parsing states were crucial to the success of our model, as was previously demonstrated in Henderson et al. (2008). There, remov-ing this conditioning led to a 3.5% drop in the SRL score. This result seems to contradict the general trend in the CoNLL-2008 shared task, where joint learning had only limited success. The latter fact may be explained by recent theoretical results demonstrating that pipelines can be preferable to joint learning (Roth et al., 2009) when no shared hidden representation is learnt. Our system (Henderson et al., 2008) was the only one which attempted to 41 learn a common hidden representation for this multitask learning problem and also was the only one which achieved significant gain from joint parameter estimation. We believe that learning shared hidden representations for related NLP problems is a very promising direction for further research."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We thank Gabriele Musillo and Dan Roth for help and advice.
