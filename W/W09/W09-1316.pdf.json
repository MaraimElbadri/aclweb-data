Normalizing medical concepts to standardized vocabularies is a common way of accounting for this variability. One of the challenges in medical concept normalization is the difficulty in comparing two concepts which are orthographically different in representation but are identical in meaning. In this work we describe a method to compare medical phrases by utilizing the information found in syntactic dependencies. We collected a large corpus of radiology reports from our university medical center. A shallow semantic parser was used to identify anatomical phrases. We performed a series of transformations to convert the anatomical phrase into a normalized syntactic dependency representation. The new representation provides an easy in-tuitive way of comparing the phrases for the purpose of concept normalization."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["A vast amount of electronic information is generated in hospitals as a part of routine clinical care due to the adoption of the electronic medical record by health care centers in the United States (Berner et al., 2005; Jha et al., 2006). A significant portion of this information is in the form of unstructured free-text (Hall, 2000; Tange et al., 1998). A free text representation makes it difficult for applications to accurately extract medical information for generic purposes (Ananiadou et al., 2004). The problem of variability of expression in natural language expression has been well studied (Bates, 1986, 1989, 1998; Blair and Maron, 1985; Funk and Reid, 1983; Furnas et al., 1984; Gomez et al., 1990). In the medical domain in particular, users frequently express the same concept in different ways and different concepts in similar ways (Ananiadou and Nenadic, 2006). To illustrate, the terms heart attack and cardiac attack both refer to the same concept – myocardial infarction. Conversely the term left lobe could refer to the left lobe of lung or the left lobe of liver depending on the context (occurrence in a chest radiology report versus a gastro-intestinal radiology report). Such variability suggests a need to normalize concepts encountered in medical reports to a standard vocabulary in order to ensure interoperability. ","Several standardized vocabularies exist in the medical domain such as the Unified Medical Language System (Humphreys and Lindberg, 1993), Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (College of American Pathologists, July 2003), Medical Subject Headings (National Library of Medicine), and the International Classification of Diseases (World Health Organization). There have been several attempts in the past (Aronson, 2001; Bashyam and Taira, 2005; Bashyam et al., 2007; Cooper and Miller, 1998; Friedman et al., 2004; Nadkarni et al., 2001; Oliver and Altman, 1994; Ruch et al., 2003; Zou et al., 2003) to map medical concepts to their standardized concept found in these terminologies. These approaches are based on mostly on lexical matching (Bashyam et al., 2007), string matching (Nadkarni et al., 2001), statistical indexing (Cooper and 125 Miller, 1998), natural language processing (Aronson, 2001; Friedman et al., 2004) information retrieval techniques (Bashyam and Taira, 2005; Oliver and Altman, 1994; Ruch et al., 2003; Zou et al., 2003) or a combination of these approaches (Cooper and Miller, 1998). These systems have managed to map a large percentage of medical terms to their respective standard terminologies in their reported experiments. While these systems have managed to perform satisfactorily for the task of normalizing simple expressions, they all acknowledge the larger problem of normalizing lengthy expressions. To illustrate, Nadkarni et al. (2001) mention the mapping of the phrase spleen rupture and normal stomach to the concept stomach rupture as a possible spurious mapping. ","We hypothesize that using deep syntactic information can help in avoiding such spurious mapping. We describe a system which uses information found in syntactic dependencies to help in the coding of lengthy phrases. Preliminary results using this approach are reported as a proof-of-concept."]},{"title":"2 Background","paragraphs":["Syntactic dependency parsing has received much focus from the natural language processing community (Eisner, 1996; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Nivre and Scholz, 2004; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003). A syntactic dependency relation is an asymmetric relation between two words. One word is called the head, and the other word is called the modifier or dependent. A word in the sentence can play the role of the head in several dependency relations (i.e., it can have several modifiers) but each word can play the role of the modifier only once. A special word, named the root, does not play the role of the modifier in any relation. The set of dependency relations that can be defined on a sentence form a tree, called the dependency tree. An example of dependencies in a typical sentence found in a radiology report is shown in Figure 1. ","Systems based on syntactic dependencies have been used successfully in several information retrieval experiments with results outperforming traditional retrieval systems (Croft et al., 1991; Gao et al., 2004; Gonzalez et al., 2005; Smeaton, 1986). In particular, this method has been used for word sense disambiguation (Lin, 1997) and thesaurus construction (Lin, 1998). Dependency trees have also been used for medical concept representation in the domains of radiology (Steimann, 1998) and pathology (Romacker et al., 1999)."]},{"title":"3 Methods","paragraphs":["3.1 Anatomy Phrase Extraction","For identifying anatomy phrases, we use a specialized phrase parser trained to identify anatomy phrases within clinical reports. The input to the parser is a sentence tagged with a part-of-speech tag and a semantic tag. The lexical analyzer module of our NLP system takes a single sentence as the input and produces an output of word tokens tagged with their syntactic and semantic classes. The semantic tag is obtained by mapping tokens in a sentence to a taxonomy handcrafted for the domain of radiology reports custom built from radiology textbooks, radiology review manuals, radiology word compilations and published radiology glossaries apart from actual radiology reports (Taira et al., 2001). Features of our implementation    Figure 1. Example of a syntactic dependency parse tree with emphasis towards semantics. Each arc","shows a dependency relation between a head and a modifier.   126 include: 1) a large number (>450) of semantic classes as compared to lexical sources currently available allowing improved discrimination for tasks such as syntactic parsing, semantic interpretation and frame building; 2) the system recognizes special symbols including dates, medical abbreviations, medical coding symbols, numeric measurements, image slice references, and proper names; and 3) the system performs some word sense disambiguation using surrounding syntactic and semantic word features. ","Our phrase parsing module currently targets anatomy phrases (e.g., right upper lobe of lung), existential relationships (e.g., there is no evidence of), and spatial relationships (e.g., is located 1cm above). We utilize a supervised learning approach to estimate the feature weights to a maximum entropy model which classifies words as the start, inside, end, single, or outside of a phrase boundary. A Viterbi dynamic programming algorithm ","is used to maximize the tag sequence probability. The anatomy phrase chunker has been tested on 4,500 sentences with recall and precision scores of 97.1% and 97.4% respectively. 3.2 Normalized Dependency Representation","We perform a series of transformations to convert an anatomical phrase from a free-text representation to a normalized dependency vector space representation. The following steps are taken in the representation conversion:  Syntactic Parsing ","The anatomy phrase identified by the phrase parser preserves lexical information which is used to obtain a dependency parse tree using a full syntactic parser. This parser is based on a novel field theory approach to dependency parsing. The parser is strongly modeled for the radiology domain with performance accuracies of 84.9% and 89.9% for link precision and recall respectively for parsing whole sentences (Taira et al., 2007). In comparison, the state-of-the-art parsers have performance accuracies in the low nineties for link precision and recall in the domain of newspaper text, with performance unknown in the domain of clinical text.  Link Reduction ","Our system classifies dependency links into two types – bilexical links and trilexical links. A bilexical link is a strong dependency relation between two words (e.g. determiner←noun) whereas a trilexical link usually has a mediator word in between the two words (e.g. finding→in→location). When possible, a trilexical link is converted to a bilexical link by the elimination of the mediator word and the link type is tagged by the mediator word. The link type can play important roles in certain cases. In cases where the mediator word is also important, the trilexical link is considered as a pair of bilexical links.  Token Level Normalization ","Once the parse tree is obtained, the tokens are normalized to their base form. The normalization is an approximate kind of lemmatization. However we also perform word level synonym normalization. For lemmatization, we use the Lexical Variant Generator tools developed by the National Library of Medicine for biomedical text (McCray et al., 1994). For synonyms, we use a handcrafted lexicon built for the domain of radiology. This step helps in avoiding missing a mapping due to lexical differences due to pluralization, abbreviations and acronyms, case differences etc. This representation is referred to as the normalized dependency vector space representation 3.3 Mapping to a Terminology","The normalized dependency parse tree is represented as in a vector space as a bag-of-links as analogous to the so-called bag-of-words representation in conventional information retrieval. Two phrases can now be compared by using similarity measures such as cosine, dice, jaccard etc. within the dimension-space of dependency-links. One phrase can be the anatomy phrase in a clinical report and the other phrase can be an entry in a standardized terminology.  127   Figure 2. Example illustrating the transformation of a medical phrase from a free-text representation to a normalized syntactic dependency vector space representation. ","An exercise in normalization is described in","Figure 2 to illustrate how this method works. Con-","sider the following phrase in a neuro-radiology","report: ventral postero-medial thalamic nucleus.","The corresponding concept in the target terminolo-","gy is the phrase postero-medial ventral nucleus of","thalamus. These phrases if compared by string","matching will not result in direct matches. Permut-","ing words and trying to compare rearrangements is","complicated. In our approach, we first preprocess","our terminology list and store it in a database. The","preprocessing step is described in the right column","(Phrase 2) of Figure 2. Starting with the phrase","postero-medial ventral nucleus of thalamus, we","first tokenize the individual words (lexical analy-","sis) in the first step. In the second step, we parse the phrase to arrive at the dependency tree. In the third step, the trilexical link nucleus←of←thalamus is converted to a bilexical link by eliminating the word of and tagging it as the link type. In the following step, each word is normalized to its base form. In the fifth step, the phrase is represented as a bag-of-links and stored in a database. Similarly all the other phrases in our terminology are stored. ","When the query phrase ventral postero-medial thalamic nucleus is compared against the terminology it undergoes the same processes previously described (Figure 2, Phrase 1). The importance of word-normalization can be seen here. In step 4, the word thalamic is normalized to thalamus. The final output is the bag-of-links representation. For con-128 venience of comparison Figure 2 shows together, the query phrase and target phrase undergoing the various steps starting from a bag-of-words representation to a bag-of-links representation. It is clear that both phrases look identical in the final representation. While a string comparison would have missed equating the two in their original word-level representation, a comparison in the dependency vector space is likely to score them as a perfect match."]},{"title":"4 Experiment and Results","paragraphs":["We obtained a set of 2500 neuro-radiology reports from our university medical center. Using the shallow semantic parser, we extracted a set of 2551 unique anatomical phrases. Of the 2551 phrases, 819 phrases were single worded terms. We discarded the single word terms. Single worded phrases do not fall into the difficult-to-map category which this method is specifically aiming to address. Moreover, a minimum of two words are required to define a syntactic dependency and thus the method is irrelevant for single worded terms. Thus we used only the 1732 multi-worded terms in our experiment. The average length of the multi-worded terms was 2.48 words.","","We chose the UMLS, a coordinated repository of vocabularies as a target for concept coding. To reduce complexity, we removed non-English concepts and concepts outside the domain of neuro-radiology by filtering out unrelated concepts. Our final terminology had a size of about 100,000 entries. We preprocessed the entire terminology using the above mentioned steps and stored the dependency representation in a database. Every anatomy phrase was queried against this database and cosine similarity was used to measure relevance. No weighting system was employed although it is possible to weight links by their types. A physician domain expert manually evaluated the results of the 1732 queries for performance. Of the 1732 phrases, 1091 phrases (62.9% accuracy, 95% CI ±0.946%) were successfully matched. Since the target set is extremely large in size (as in any IR system), a recall analysis was not performed. A baseline comparison with MMTx (in phrase mode) resulted in 1051 phrases (60.68% accuracy, 95% CI ±0.49%) being mapped by MMTx. Table 1 summarizes the results. "]},{"title":"5 Discussion","paragraphs":["Analysis of the errors showed that the following error types resulted in the inability to match phrases perfectly:  Parsing without context: ","A syntactic parser can parse a sentence and identify dependency relations in a sentence. However, when a phrase is given as an input, it is not always easy to parse a phrase and generate a dependency representation. There is context (remain-ing portions of the sentence) missing which is needed to unambiguously parse the phrase. In the case of anatomical phrases, our system was able to parse it because the source sentences from which they were extracted were available. However, in the case of the UMLS phrases, there is no such available information. Therefore manual parsing of several UMLS phrases had to be performed. One potential solution to this problem could be to identify MEDLINE sentences that contain these UMLS concepts and obtain a dependency parse tree using the context of the sentence.  Modular system architecture: ","Since the system is modular, any errors in one of the modules (tokenization, word level normalization etc.) would result in the final dependency representation being imperfect. The specific errors we noticed were:  Parsing Errors: ","Our parser has a higher accuracy for parsing phrases than whole sentences. However in this experiment, there were 37 instances where it failed in","MMTx Matched Phrases Syn. Dependency Matched Phrases","1051 1091 n=1732 60.68% 62.99%  (±0.49%) (±0.49%)   Table 1. Overview of Results 129 assigning the correct links. This resulted in partial matches."," Word Normalization Errors: ","There is a natural ambiguity introduced when words are normalized to their base forms. Words with completely different senses can have the same root form (e.g. left"]},{"title":"←","paragraphs":["leaves and left"]},{"title":"←","paragraphs":["left (spatial direction)). Similarly, a word can have different normalized forms depending on the sense (e.g. leaf"]},{"title":"←l","paragraphs":["eaves and left"]},{"title":"←","paragraphs":["leaves). A robust method for word-level normalization is desired that can also perform word-sense disambiguation. Currently the NLM’s word level normalization tool is being used which is not perfect and therefore errors introduced due to this module result in the entire phrase being transformed incorrectly or ambiguously. The ideal word level normalization will result in the words cancer, cancerous, carcinoma all conflating to the same word which is beyond purely morphological analysis."," Link Reduction Errors:","","Not all relations manifest as simple bilexical and trilexical links. Some relations are tetralexical and although they can be reduced effectively to bilexical links, the methodology needs to be investigated. To illustrate, consider the phrases ‘mass consistent with cancer’ and ‘cancerous mass’ parsed as  mass"]},{"title":"←","paragraphs":["consistent"]},{"title":"←","paragraphs":["with"]},{"title":"←","paragraphs":["cancer cancerous"]},{"title":"→","paragraphs":["mass. ","The former is parsed as four words with three links. To convert it into a bilexical link, the words ‘consistent’ and ‘with’ need to be: (1) clustered as a single token and (2) eliminated by transferring it to the link as a label. This is a more complicated process and we still haven’t explored such abstractions. A robust rule based link reduction system is desired to handle such cases. ","Another limitation of this method is that the heuristic rules for link reduction may not be applicable outside the radiology domain. Finally, syntactic dependency parsers are built using computationally complex algorithms. Thus while using them can result in advanced language understanding, they may not be suitable for real-time applications. There is always a tradeoff between accuracy and speed and it remains to be seen if robust low complexity parsers can be developed.","","The inability to perform a recall analysis also make is difficult to judge the theoretical best performance. That is, it is quite likely that there are many phrases in our dataset that do not have a corresponding UMLS concept. Performing a recall analysis would help in determining this.","","While we noticed several areas of improvement in our system, we were encouraged by the comparison of the overall results of our system to that of MMTx. We did not do an error analysis of MMTx since several previous publications have documented the various kinds of errors in MMTx (Bashyam et al., 2007; Divita et al., 2004; Meng et al., 2005). Our idea is to provide a baseline comparison showing that our approach performs comparably if not better than MMTx which is the most commonly used1","tool for concept coding. To our knowledge this the first time syntactic dependencies have been used for this task, Previous attempts have relied purely on shallow parsers.",""]},{"title":"6 Future Work","paragraphs":["Increasing the robustness of the individual modules is a primary requirement for further experiments to prevent the weakest link effect cascading to the final output. Specifically we plan to work towards a robust word level normalization system. Additionally, robust evaluation methods including comparisons with other techniques will be investigated."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Syntactic dependency based methods for medical concept coding show promise. While some of the described implementations are specific to domain (radiology) and phrase type (anatomy), it is expected that the principle is general enough to be applied in other domains as well.  1 For an overview of recent applications of MMTx, see (Bashyam et al., 2007) 130"]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The authors would like to thank Lew Andrada,","Gregory Leazer, Jonathan Furner and Christine","Borgman for several useful suggestions.
