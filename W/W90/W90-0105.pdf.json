This information ranges over both the static organization of vocabulary -- including lexical knowledge, often handled separately as \"lexical semantics\" (see, e.g., [Pustejovsky, 1988; Nirenburg and Raskin, 1987]) or \"structural semantics\" -- and the process of lexical choice. To make allowance for this latter dynamic aspect of the lexical organization we will henceforth use the term lexis common in systemic linguistics [Hasan, 1987; Matthiessen, 1988] instead of \"lexicon\". Lexis thus represents lexical information at various different levels of abstraction (strata) and mapping structures that provide for the conversion between those levels. In this paper we address the organization of lexis giving special consideration to the expresssion and choice of appropriate expressions as a function of the desired salience or prominence of semantic elements. The choice set of possible configurations of prominence we call the perspectives of the semantic structure.","These have been addressed rarely in approaches in generation so far: for example, [Jacobs, 1985] discusses the verbs give and take as two different expressions of the same event; [Nirenburg and Nirenburg, 1988] suggest an approach to open-class lexical item selection for realization of conceptual input; and [Iordanskaja et al.,"]},{"title":"John A.

Here, we make more extensive use of the MTT in order to provide a richer organization of lexis and its interaction with grammar and knowledge than has been proposed previously. Moreover, we develop this approach in the context of a concrete generation environment, the PENMAN system [Mann and Matthiessen, 1985], showing some areas where the existing architecture is insufficient and how the richer organization of lexis we propose can help.","The following set of examples gives an impression of the variety of linguistic phenomena that we include under the term perspective. 1 All the sentences can be in-terpreted as verbalizations of a single abstract semantic structure with differing aspects of that structfire being given emphasis in each case. For example, in (4), the reader is made salient as a participant of the proposition; in (5), the 'manner of achievement' of the 'indication' is made salient; in (7), a particular temporal aspect of the process, namely the beginning, is made prominentput; and in (8), the intended purpose of the agent is made salient as a 'making clear'. While the variation that can be seen between (1), (2), and (3) can already be treated in, for example, the current PENMAN system by exercising meaning options available in the grammar (i.e., (2) exhibits passivization and (3) nominalization of 'use'), the variation shown in the remaining examples cannot be functionally motivated as possible alternate grammatical realizations of the base semantic form. 1.

Most extensively they are handled by I. Mel'~uk et al. in the scope of the Meaning-Text-Theory by means of lexleal functions (LFs). Our approach to generating this range of variation takes its starting point, therefore, from the notion of lexical cooccurrence relations addressed by Mel'~uk. There is a large body of descriptive work based on the notion of LFs which has been carried out for different languages [Mel'~uk and Zholkovsky, 1984; Mel'~uk et al., 1988; Zholkovsky, 1970; Reuther, 1978; Janus, 1971] and we will suggest how this body of knowledge can now provide significant input to work on text generation.","In the next section we give an introduction to LFs as the means by which lexical cooccurrence dependencies are expressed within the MTT; we then describe some problems with the existing organization of LFs as defined by Mel'~uk eta/. and show how that organization can be developed further to be used for the modeling of various perspectives. In the section following, we then discuss the influence of lexis, when enriched by perspectives, on the generation process and, subsequently, we present a detailed example of the guidance this provides."]},{"title":"The Nature and Organization of Lexical Functions","paragraphs":["Lexical cooccurrence in the scope of MTT is provided","in terms of lexical functions which Mel'~uk defines as","follows [Mel'~uk and Polgu6re, 1987]: aA lexical ~_nction f is a dependency that associates with","lexeme L, called the argument of f, another iexeme (or a set of (quasi.)synonymous iexemes) L' which expresses, with respect to L, a very abstract meaning (...) and plays a specific syntactic role. For instance, tor a noun N-denoting an action, the LF Opera specifies a verb (...) which takes as its grammatical subject the name of the agent of the said action and as its direct object, the lexeme N itself. The values for any particular application of a LF to a lexeme are provided by an Explanatory Combinatorial Dictionary (ECD); dictionaries of this type for a number of languages have already been compiled by MTT researchers. Thus, for example, the ECD for English provides for the following applications of the LF Operl:","Operl (influence) = exert","Operl (punishment} = administer These give lexical verbs appropriate for use when the argument is to appear as a direct object to form a combination where an agent (optionally) acts upon some patient; e.g.: He exerted influence on P..., He administered a punishment..., but not, * he exerted a punishment..., * he administered an influence ....","Cooccurrence relations of this kind are pervasive in natural language and need to be captured in the representation of a language's lexical resources. Such cooccurrence relations can be rather arbitrary and so are unlikely to be supportable by, for example, distinctions maintained in the knowledge base. Their meaning is not, however, arbitrary. An important claim of MTT is that each LF represents a particular abstract meaning which remains invariant across its various applications. Thus, for example, further LFs include: Fuse0 with the meaning 'something takes place' (Func0 (accident) = {occur, happen}, as in the sentence: The accident occured two hours ago.); Result standing for a state following the process addressed (Result (study) = master, as in the sentence: John mastered his subject.); and Liqu expressing an active process termination. This latter LF is often used in so called composed LFs where a number of LFs are combined in a predefined order (LiquFunc0 (Fire) = {extinguish, put out}, as in the sentence: The fire brigade could put out the fire quickly).","MTT classifies LFs into two general types: lexieal parameters, which provide syntagmatie relationships (e.g., Operi with i = 1,2,...), and lexieal substitutes, which provide paradigmatic relationships (e.g., Gener -- a specific generalization relation) [Mel'~uk and Zholkovsky, 1970]. However, since LFs typically correspond to knowledge at varying levels of abstraction in addition to lexical information, these classes are still very heterogenous. Previous ap-","roaches that have made use of LFs in generation (e.g.,","ittredge and Mel'~uk, 1983; Iordanskaja et al., 1988; Bourbean et al., 1989]) have been hindered by this. In order to exploit the notion of LFs in generation more extensively, we need further organizational principles that emphasize the meanings distinct LFs possess.","Work in progress at IPSI suggests that the large number of heterogeneous LFs used within MTT can be organized coherently in terms of the functions and semantic distinctions that they represent. Based on this, we have defined part of a general model of lexis with a taxonomic organization underlying it, within which the most general structures provide the representations of lexical semantics and the most delicate ones lexicaliza-tion. For the purposes of this paper, we will restrict attention to the organization of LFs that are particularly relevant for modeling situation perspectives as illustrated in our examples above. In Figure 1 we set out 32 in network form general distinctive features that classify the meaning that the LFs we discuss here cover. 2 The network explicates LFs by classifying each of them according to a particular set of semantic features. The general function of the network is thus to relate particular LFs to the functional conditions for their application. This defines the meaning that any LF expresses and so provides a functionally organized key into the LF-oriented dictionaries being developed within MTT. The network also shows the hierarchical arrangement lying behind the meaning of LFs and so reflects the relation of perspectives to one another.","We will now briefly describe in semantic terms a representative set of the LFs covered by the network, showing how the network relates perspectival presentation decisions to choices of LFs. 3 Then, with the organizational network of perspectives in place and motivated, we show how it can be used to guide the generation process to produce the kinds of variation illustrated in"]},{"title":"(1)-(9).","paragraphs":["Situation introduction One of the basic terms used in the scope of MTT is that of abstract situations, circumscribed, roughly, as something that takes place. In the sense of Mel'~uk, abstract situations are defined by key terms and the participants of the situations; the key term is designated by the LF So, the participants as Si (i-th participant of the situation). We view this construct here as an abstract semantic partial specification of what is to be expressed linguistically. Thus, looking at the situation of teaching, the ECD for English offers us:","So (teaching) = teaching,","$1 (teaching) = teacher,","SO (teaching) = pupil. The notion of situational key terms is closely related to term of processes in the tradition of Systemic Functional Grammar [tlalliday, 1985; Steiner et al., 1987].","When a situation is introduced, this may be done respecting a number of varying attributions Of salience e.g., the salience of particular participants of a situation or the situation itself.","The selection of particular combinations of process and participants for the realization of abstract situa-","2The notation of Figure 1 follows that used within the NIGEL grammar of the PENMAN system for the specification of grammar possibilities. Names in capitals represent the names of choice points, and names in lower case features which may be selected: one from each choice point; also square brackets represent disjunction of features and braces conjunction. Such networks can be readily expressed in a number of distinct formalisms, e.g., FUG (cf. [Kasper, 1988]), LOOM (cf. [Kasper, 19895]).","3In the full version of this network, the consequences of each possible selection of features for LF selection is specified; space precludes a detailed discussion at this point, although examples are given below. tions according to differing attributions of salience is then provided in the scope of the ECD by LFs of various groups. For example: Func, which has the effect of attributing salience to the term labeling the situation; Oper, which has the effect of attributing salience to one of the participants; and Labor which has the effect of attributing salience to a combination of the participants. The selection of these broad groups is made in the network by the choices available under SITUATIONAL ORIENTATION, by the features 'situation oriented' (Func) and 'participant oriented' (Oper, Labor).","These are further differentiated according to which participants are affected; e.g.: Operl makes the 'first' participant of the situation salient (i.e., the participant for which the LF $1 provides a lexeme) and Oper2 the 'second' (i.e., the participant for which the LF $2 provides a lexeme): Oper2 (influence) = be under. Similarly, Func0 makes the key term of the situation itself salient, while Func: introduces the situation with particular respect to the first participant: Func0 (problem) = exist, FUnCl (problem) = come [from]. Labor12 makes the first and the second participant salient, the first more then the second, Labor21, on the contrary, makes the second participant more salient, e.g.: Laborl2 (pressure) = bring to bear [on], Labor21 (pressure) = get [from]. These options are controlled by the further selections of participants to be accorded salience in the choice points SITUATION ORIENTATION and PARTICIPANT ORIENTATION.","Finally, the third option in the SITUATIONAL ORIENTATION system, 'process orientation' is responsible for the neutral LF V0, which provides the most direct lexical verb for realizing the key term of a situation; e.g.,"]},{"title":"Vo ( i.lzuence) = [to] influence.","paragraphs":["Temporal dependency LFs also address the global arrangement of a process on the temporal axes by the definition of its preceding and succeeding processes. These considerations are reached in the network by a feature selection of {global temporal oriented, ..., } from the alternatives of the TEMPORAL ORIENTATION choice point. These alternatives call for the application of the LFs Prox and Perf; examples of which from the ECD for English are: ProxFunc0 (storm) = brew, Perf (storm) = subside. In addition, the internal temporal aspects of a process, represented by its stages, axe reflected by the corresponding triple of \"phasal\" LFs: Incep for the beginning, Cont for continuing, and Fin for the termination stage. These meanings are reached via the features under the 'stage oriented' option in the choice point PROCESS STAGES ORIENTATION in the network.

A specification of perspectival presentatation features as defined in the network of Figure 1 makes it possible to generate rather varied surface realizational forms. We can view this network as a candidate for the textual organization [Matthiessen, 1988] of lexis -- which complements the more traditional 'propositional' organization found in lexical discrimination nets (e.g., [Goldman, 1975]) and thesauri. The textual/communicative functional meanings of LFs we propose, although arguably inherent in the MTM, have not formerly been extracted as an explicit principle of organization. We suggest that this kind of organization may substantiMly enhance the information collected by MTM researchers. Finally, although we have restricted our-selves in this paper to details that are particularly relevant for modeling situation perspectives, we are working towards a general model of lexis including, e.g., a semantically motivated classification of verbs, relations, etc. as proposed by, for example, [Matthiessen, 1988; Hasan, 1987] and pursued in a computational context by [Fawcett and Tucker, 1989].
