Walker (ACL) Bellcore 445 South Street, MRE 2A379 Morristown, NJ 07960, USA Preface","paragraphs":["Generating multi-sentential text rcquires the ability to compose individual claus~'s into larger units, a process called text planning. C, learly, text planning is an important component of our linguistic competence: we do not always communicate by single, isolated, clause-sized utterances. Two approaches to this question in the field of text generation have proved seminal: McKeown's 1982 th,,sis, in which she uses rhetorical schemata to represent typical domain-independent text structures, and the text planners under development at ISI since 1988 under the direction of Ed Hovy, which us,, plan operators based on Mann and Thompson's Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) in a STR,IPSlike planning architecture. What these two approaches have in common is the term \"rhetorical\" and the claim that they are domain-independent architectures. While they have spawned a la.rg,' number of approaches, architectures, systems, and theories, there has been a general undercurre~tt of dissatisfaction with things \"rhetorical\"; for example, various discourse phÂ¢~nomena ha.v,\" Iw,,,, identified in the literature that, specific theories (usually, RST) cannot handle, or ca.lmot handle, ,,I-egantly. Furthermore, researchers in discourse analysis (as opposed to text gen,~ra.tion) ha.w' Ivy ;.m,I large ignored rhetorical approaches, or brushed them off as insignificant, often arguing thal. rh~q.or-ical relations are an epiphenomenon of deeper relations between communicatiw: intent.ions. This widespread use of, and simultaneous dislike of, rhetorical relations has motivated this workshc*l~. If a theory of rhetorical relations is useful (or required'?) for text planning, then it. must co~/.ain son,,, useful insight. If such theories are disliked, then present theories of rhetoric~d relations (su,'h ~s RST) need to be improved, or perhaps completely reworked. In order to approach thesr |.asks. :~ clearer understanding of the underlying theoretical issues is required. The goal of the workshol~ is t,, bring together researchers from different fields, including discourse understanding, discourse g,'~,'~ ation, and linguistic discourse analysis, and to discuss the relationship between discourse rcla.l.ionls, intentions, and the representation of the discourse participants' beliefs, desires, and intentions. Th,' hope is that a lively discussion will help identify useful insights that should be retained, a.t~d obvi,,~s errors that should be avoided, in future theories of discourse structure.
