The most challenging domain for all these tasks is spontaneous spoken language, which tends to be more terse, less grammatical, less structured, and more ambiguous than planned or written text. For this reason, the annotation of spoken language corpora with accurate, high-quality linguistic tags has become a topic of great interest recently (Dybkj¬ær et al., 1998; Ide, 1998; Core et al., 1999).","The target of our semantic annotations is the CallHome Japanese (CHJ) corpus (LDC, 1996). The CHJ corpus consists of digitized speech data and text transcriptions of 120 spontaneous, unscripted telephone conversations in Japanese. Each transcript is en- ∗","Visiting CSLI, Stanford University (1999-2000). coded in EUC-format Japanese characters and covers a contiguous 5 or 10 minute segment taken from a recorded conversation lasting up to 30 minutes. To illustrate, a brief fragment (the ûrst three utterances) of a CHJ transcript is given in Figure 1 (an English gloss appears below the fragment). Each utterance in a transcript is analyzed into individual morphemes, with transcriber comments in brackets. The speaker (A or B) and the start and end times of each utterance (i.e. speaker turn) are also provided in the transcripts. The 120 conversations in the CHJ corpus contain a total of about 340,000 word/morpheme tokens, 12,000 unique word/morpheme types, and 39,000 speaker turns.","The CHJ corpus was originally created for research in large vocabulary speech recognition. However, we hope to make the corpus useful for other types of NLP research (by ourselves and others) by supplementing it with a variety of linguistic annotations. When ûnished, we plan to make the annotated CHJ corpus available to the research community through the LDC.","We are annotating the CHJ corpus with a variety of syntactic, semantic, and acoustic/prosodic tags. In this paper we focus on our semantic annotations, which include the following: ¬• Semantic classes for all verbs and nouns. ¬• Verb senses for each main verb.","¬• Predicate-argument relations between main verbs and their explicitly mentioned verb complements, labeled with thematic roles.","By way of example, Table 1 shows the end time boundary te (i.e. duration), POS, pronunciation, canonical form (including verb sense 120.20 123.35 A: @ [[ ,col]] 123.26 123.70 B: 124.28 128.50 A: @ [[ ,col]]","@ [[ ,col]] {laugh} Translation: A: Uso, Lie, atashi I shoku employment -ga nom nakute not-have sa yïkno w nihon Japan -ni dat kaetta returned -ra. if. îNo way.

For speech corpora, notable contributions include the Corpus Encoding Standard (CES, http://www.cs.vassar.edu/CES/), MATE (Dybkj¬ær et al., 1998), and the îannotation graphï approach of Bird and Liberman (1998). adopting that scheme. However, our primary aim is to provide simple, accurate, low-level annotations (upon which other, higher-level annotations might be based) so that language researchers can use the corpus more üexibly and with greater conûdence.","Some of the annotations which we have already completed, or nearly completed, but will not discuss in this paper include the following:","¬• Phonetic transcriptions, in Roman characters (kunreisiki transliteration), of all 120 conversations.","¬• POS tags using the LDCïs existing inventory of 60 syntactic and morphological tags for Japanese.","¬• Raw acoustic data from the ESPS/waves+ speech processing software, including f0 (fundamental frequency) and power (root-mean-square amplitude) measurements at 10ms intervals.","¬• The duration of each word, based on semi-automatic word segmentation of the speech data.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe NTTïs Goi-Taikei semantic dictionary, which is the source of our semantic tagset. Section 3 describes our tagging methodology and our pilot study of the verb sense annotation task. Finally, Section 4 describes our browser-based annotation application."]},{"title":"2 Goi-Taikei","paragraphs":["As a base for our tags, we are using the Goi-Taikei (GT) Japanese lexicon (Ikehara et al., 1997), a 400,000-word lexicon and ontology developed by NTT for machine translation (MT) applications.","We decided that GT is an appropriate resource for our semantic annotation task for three reasons. First, semantic information from GT has already proved valuable in a variety of NLP applications in Japan, including parsing, morphological analysis, text-to-speech, proofreading, and MT (Ikehara et al., 1994; Shirai et al., 1995; Akiba et al., 1995; Oku, 1996; Nakaiwa and Seki, 1999; Baldwin et al., 1999; Baldwin and Tanaka, 1999; Yokoyama and Ochiai, 1999). Secondly, the GT lexicon and ontology, at 400,000 words, is signiû- cantly larger than earlier dictionaries, such as the 260,000-word EDR Dictionary (EDR, 1996) and the 2,000-word IPAL lexicon (IPA, 1987; IPA, 1990; IPA, 1996). GT also contains detailed valency information for 16,000 predicate senses, which makes it more suited to our task than the Kadokawa thesaurus (Hamanishi and Ono, 1990). Finally, GT is available in book and CD-ROM format at a price (around US $750) that is several times lower than EDR.","GT consists of three main components: (i) an ontology, (ii) a semantic word dictionary, and (iii) a semantic structure dictionary which includes subcategorization frames for verbs and adjectives. 2.1 Ontology GTïs ontology classiûes concepts to use in expressing relationships between words. The meanings of common nouns are given in terms of a semantic hierarchy of 2,710 nodes. Most of the top four levels of the semantic hierarchy are shown in Figure 2, with two examples of deeper nodes. Each node represents a semantic class. Edges in the hierarchy represent is-a or has-a relationships, so that the child of a semantic class related by an is-a relation is subsumed by it. For example, nation is-a organization. In addition to the 2,710 classes (12-level tree structure) for common nouns, there are 200 classes (9-level tree structure) for proper nouns and 108 classes (5-level tree structure) for predicates. 2.2 Semantic Word Dictionary The GT semantic dictionary includes 100,000 common nouns, 200,000 proper nouns, 70,000 technical terms and 30,000 other words: 400,000 words in all.","Figure 3 shows a simpliûed example of one record of the Japanese semantic word dictionary. Each record speciûes an index form, pronunciation, canonical form, syntactic information and a set of semantic classes. The syntactic information includes the part of speech, inüectional class, detailed parts of speech, conjunctive conditions and so on. Each word can have up to ûv e common noun semantic classes and ten proper noun semantic classes. The numbering system gives common-noun semantic classes a preûx of c, proper-noun classes a preûx of p, and predicate classes a preûx of v. In Figure 3, for example, the word nihon íJapanì belongs to the common-noun classes c0385 nation (⊂ organization) and c0463 territory (⊂ place), and to proper-noun class p0030 country (⊂ place name). More examples of semantic classes for the nouns and verbs from the annotated CHJ fragment in Table 1 are listed in that table under the column labeled îClassï. 2.3 Semantic Structure Dictionary The basic structure of a clause comes from the relationship between the main verb and nouns. GTïs structure transfer dictionary, de-signed for MT applications, provides this basic clause structure. GT provides 10,000 patterns in its common structure transfer dictionary and person","agent organization nation facility","concrete place region territory natural place","object animate","noun inanimate mental state","abstract thing action human activity","abstract event phenomenon natural phenomenon","relation [etc.] Figure 2: GTïs Semantic Hierarchy (top 4 levels)            Index Form Pronunciation /nihon/ Canonical Form Part of Speech noun Semantic Classes [ common noun nation (c0385), territory (c0463) proper noun country (p0030) ]            Figure 3: Japanese Lexical Entry for noun nihon íJapanì 5,000 patterns in its idiomatic structure transfer dictionary. The common structure transfer dictionary contains an average of 2.3 patterns for each verb.","Figure 4 gives an example from the common structure transfer dictionary. Each predicate is associated with one or more arguments labeled N1, N2, . . . . Each case-slot contains information such as grammatical function, case-marker, case-role, semantic restrictions on the ûller and default order (not all features are shown in the example). The arguments correspond between Japanese and English, thus giving the backbone of the transfer. 2.3.1 Case Roles Case-elements in the valency dictionary are associated with particular case roles (also known as thematic roles, θ-roles, or deep cases). The current set of case roles is given in Table 2, along with the most commonly associated case markers2","in Japanese, and prepositions or grammatical functions (gf) in English. The annotated CHJ fragment in Table 1 shows some speciûc","2","Japanese case markers (also known as îparticlesï) are postpositions, and are similar to English prepositions in many ways. case-role ûllers under the column labeled îArgumentsï. For example, word 008, nihon íJapanì, serves as the goal argument (N5) of the verb kaetta íreturned (home)ì in that utterance.","There seems to be no consensus among linguists on what the best set of case roles is, or even whether case roles should be replaced by more abstract primitives or more concrete participant-roles. In any case, case roles have in practice proved extremely useful for NLP and are used in most MT systems (Bond and Shirai, 1997)."]},{"title":"3 Tagging methodology","paragraphs":["We are annotating the CHJ corpus with (i) semantic classes for all nouns and verbs; (ii) verb senses for all main verbs; and (iii) predicate-argument relations between main verbs and their complements in the same utterance. Our tagging of verb senses and predicate-argument relations relies on the browser-based annotation application described in Section 4. The predicate-argument tags, based on GTïs semantic structure dictionary (Section 2.3), provide a basic dependency structure for each utterance.                         Pattern-ID -0002-00-Semantic Class (action) Japanese          pred toru (verb) N1 [ case-marker ga í nomì (Agent) restriction agent ] N2 [ case-marker o í accì (Object-1) restriction lodging, room, vehicle, ... ]          English      pred reserve (verb) N1 [ function subject (nominative) ] N2 [ function direct-object (accusative)]                              Figure 4: Part of the common structure transfer dictionary for one sense of toru ítak eì Label Name Case-marker English Label Name Case-marker English N1 Agent ga (kara, towa) Subj (gf) N8 Locative ni, o, de, e, kara in/at/on N2 Object-1 o (nituite) Obj (gf) N9 Comitative to with N3 Object-2 ni (. . . ) I-Obj (gf) N10 Quotative to N4 Source kara, yori from N11 Material kara, yori, de with, from N5 Goal ni, e, made to (until) N12 Cause kara, yori, de for N6 Purpose ni for N13 Instrument de with N7 Result ni, to as N14 Means de by Table 2: Case-roles Although spontaneous utterances like those in the CHJ corpus are often fragmentary and ungrammatical, rendering full syntactic parsing impractical, the basic relations between pred-icates and their arguments still hold. 3.1 Tagging semantic classes We assign GT semantic classes to individual CHJ nouns and verbs by automatic table lookup on their GT canonical form. In both GT and the CHJ lexicon, the canonical forms of words are generally in Chinese characters (kanji ). For example, the annotated CHJ fragment in Table 1 shows some canonical forms under the column labeled îCanonicalï. For the verbs in Table 1, the canonical (dictionary) form includes the GT verb sense number.","In the majority of cases, the GT canonical form of a verb or noun is identical to the canonical form which appears in the CHJ lexicon. The small percentage of cases where the canonical forms differ are corrected by hand. For the approximately 700 nouns in the CHJ corpus that are not covered in the GT lexicon (mainly personal names), we assign the closest available GT class(es) by hand.","We are marking each noun and verb in the corpus with all of its GT semantic classes, even those which might be inappropriate for the word in its particular utterance context. For example, in the annotated CHJ fragment in Table 1, the noun nihon íJapanì is marked with all three of its GT classes: c0385 nation (⊂ organization), c0463 territory (⊂ place), and p0030 country (⊂ place name). Naturally, it would preferable to exclude those semantic classes which are inappropriate for a given noun or verb in its particular context of use in the CHJ corpus. However, this would require human coders to classify hundreds of thousands of word tokens based on the perceived context in the conversation. In addition, it would be hard to obtain high inter-annotator reliability, given the context-dependent nature of the task and the amount of overlap in the semantic classes. 3.2 Tagging verb senses and arguments We are providing human-tagged verb sense and verb argument annotations for each main verb in the corpus. Auxiliary verbs and other forms of verb morphology are ignored, except in cases like the passive and causative in which the valence of the main verb is altered. In those cases, special passive or causative senses are provided.","Our plan is to annotate the GT verb senses and argument indexes according to the majority judgments of three native-speaker student assistants. The students will make the annotations by clicking on menu choices in a web application that we generate automatically from the GT dictionary ûles and CHJ transcript ûles (Section 4). 3.3 A pilot study In preparation for the verb sense tagging project, we conducted a pilot study in which we asked ûv e native speakers to select GT verb senses and identify intrasentential arguments for all 110 main verbs in one ûv e-minute CHJ transcript.","Our initial results showed that pairwise inter-annotator agreement on verb senses was 0.68. When chance agreement is taken into account via the kappa statistic, the result, κ = 0.63, shows that annotator agreement was not reliable (Carletta, 1996). However, we discovered that this result was largely attributable to the annotatorsï selection of the category ínone (of the above),ì which the ûv e judges picked with highly variable frequency ({7, 11, 22, 25, 26}, s = 8.6). For 51 of the 110 verb tokens (46%), ínoneì was selected by one or more judges, and agreement was low (0.48, κ = 0.42). When the ínoneì answers were disregarded, pairwise agreement on those verbs rose considerably (to 0.67, κ = 0.64). For the remaining 59 verb tokens (54%), ínoneì was never chosen and pairwise agreement was very reliable (0.84, κ = 0.82). For the second task, identifying the intrasentential arguments to verbs, pairwise agreement was also very high: 0.89 among annotators who chose the same verb sense.","We then examined more closely those cases in which the low agreement was attributable to inconsistent use of the category ínoneì. We found that most of these cases involved very common, îligh tï verbs such as suru ídoì and naru íb ecomeì. As it turned out, GT was lacking some common colloquial senses for these verbs. For example, the verb suru ídoì was often used as in utterance (1). (1) ato after ni-shuu-kan 2-weeks-long shita did ra if îin about two weeksï This sense of suru ídoì does not appear in the GT lexicon. In written Japanese suru would not normally be used in this way; rather, a more specialized verb such as tatsu ípassì would be preferred.","In sum, the results of our pilot study lead us to conclude that we are likely to obtain reliable inter-annotator agreement on the verb sense task, provided the following steps are taken:","¬• The highly general, spoken-language senses of certain common îligh tï verbs need to be added to GT.","¬• The conditions under which the coders are to use the category ínone (of the above)ì need to be carefully delineated. In particular, ínoneì should only be selected when there is a particular, standard, well-deûned sense of the verb in question that clearly should be listed in the lexicon but is not.","We are encouraged in this regard by the results of Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig (1999) who were able, using careful experimental methodology, to achieve replicable agreement on English word senses (albeit by lexicographers, not students) of 95% in the Senseval project. Our experience echoes the observation of Kilgarriff (1998) that annotators should be given the opportunity to offer feedback to the lexicographers, including information such as inadequate or missing verb senses."]},{"title":"4 The annotation application","paragraphs":["We developed a browser-based semantic annotation application speciûcally for this project. The application is implemented using HTML forms within a web browser (Figure 5). We wrote Perl scripts to generate the annotation forms automatically, using the CHJ transcripts, CHJ lexicon, and GT database as input. Figure 5: Screen shot of verb sense diambiguation application","The left frame of the application displays the transcript of a CHJ conversation. NPs in the transcript are enclosed in square brackets, and main verbs are underlined and hyperlinked. Clicking on a main verb in the transcript (left frame) brings up a verb sense menu for that verb in the right frame.","For example, in Figure 5, the verb sense menu for a token of the verb hazimaru íb eginì (fourth utterance in the left frame) has been brought up in the right frame. The four GT senses of hazimaru are listed as menu choices. Each sense is assigned a unique subcategorization frame, including the case roles (N1, N2, etc.; cf. Table 2). The subcategorized-for semantic categories are also underlined and hyperlinked to a diagram of the complete GT ontology (cf. Figure 2), so that the coders can see examples of each category and how that category ûts into the broader semantic framework. Finally, an English gloss of each verb sense (from the GT transfer component) is given at the end of each subcategorization frame.","Once a coder selects the correct verb sense for the verb token in question (in the case of Figure 5, it is the ûrst sense listed), the coder then selects that verbïs NP complements (case-role ûllers), if any, from within the same utterance. For example, in Figure 5, the coder has selected the ûrst verb sense for hazimaru íb eginì, which subcategorizes for the NP arguments N1 (subject) and N3 (start time). Separate menu forms are displayed for both N1 and N3, with all NPs in the utterance listed as possible ûllers. In this case the coder selected gakkou ísc hoolì as the subject and sanjuuichinichi íthe 31stì as the start time. If no NP in the utterance ûlls a given role, the zero option is selected (this is the default choice). Finally, the coder clicks î Submitï and then moves on to the next verb in the transcript (left frame).
