Previous meetings were organized in Madrid, Sydney, and Bergen, co-located with different, but always computational linguistics-oriented, events. We are pleased that this time we could combine efforts with the grammar induction and inductive logic programming for language processing communities. It is the explicit wish of the SIGNLL board to have the CoNLL meeting address all aspects of computational natural language learning, including issues that are not regularly discussed at computational linguistics meetings, such as computational models of human language acquisition, computational models of the origins and evolution of language, biologically-inspired learning methods, etc. We are thrilled by the quality and quantity of the submissions, which allowed us to set up an intense but rewarding program with one invited talk, 12 long talks, and joint paper sessions with LLL-2000 and ICGI-2000. On top of that, we introduced two innovations: there are 12 bullet presentations, short talks accompanied by a poster presentation, and a shared task session in which 11 authors report on how their machine learning method performed on our shared task -- the identification of syntactic constituents in text (chunking). In this part of the proceedings, you will find 37 papers providing a useful record of all presentations. You can find out more about SIGNLL and its activities at http : //www. aclweb, org/signll/.

This year LLL was integrated with the Fourth Conference on Language Learning (CoNLL) and the Fifth International Colloquium on Grammatical Inference (ICGI) with which LLL shares strong common scientific interests in language learning. The registration to ICGI, CoNLL and LLL was a joint registration so that registrants could freely move belLween the three events. As in the first edition, LLL has attracted pluridisciplinary submissions from the three research fields --","Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning and Computational Logic, demonstrating the growing interest in NLP methods based on ILP or non-classic logics, and hybrid methods. Relational learning more and more appears as complementary to data analysis in many NLP domains. Relational learning and logic-based learning prove here again their capacity to learn complex structured linguistic resources and knowledge such as ontology and grammar from corpora and explicit background knowledge. The scientific program of LLL-2000 consisted of one invited talk by Jrrg-Uwe Kietz on the acquisition of ontology and seven paper presentations. Six of them are reported here and the paper by Christophe Costa Florencio, accepted for presentation by both LLL and ICGI, has been published in the ICGI proceedings. The joint sessions with ICGI and CoNLL included one invited talk by Dan Roth and paper and poster presentations.
