Furthermore, we provide a treatment for the resolution of multiple anaphors, resulting from a range of possible antecedents including plurals and multiple antecedents.","The approach to discourse anaph°ra resolution we take in this paper integrates a rigorous formal semantic machinery within a theory Of discourse strtlc-ture. Before giving a detailed account of our treatmeat of di~murse reference resolution, we would llke to address explicitly some of the positions towards rdereace resolution and discour~ ~mcture which inform our work. 1.1 Theoretical and Methodological","Considerations To begin with, we should state explicitly that our enterprise is a semantic one~ we are interested in devetoping and implemen \"ring a formalization capable of ._,~'amln~ a con-ect interpretation to each utterance in a discourse. In this, we are fully committed to the Dynamic Semantics enterprise (Kamp 1981, H~m 1982, Groenendijk and Stokhof, 1990, 1991, Cider- ~i. 1992, van den Berg 1991, Kamp and Reyle 1993, Asher 1993, van den Berg 1998). Except in so far as it is provably necessary, we are not concerned with psychological L~sues of how human language users pro~ discourse nor with what human beings in-tend when they use language to commuIlicate with one another.","Our aim is to build machinery applicable to all genres and all modes of comm~nLication. Thus we can not assume that a discourse is n ec~xlly uco. hereat\" and that our goal is to provide an account of why that is so, nor can we assume that all discourse iswritten or spoken or.occurs in a task context where the demands or reasonable expectations of a~ external activity are available to guide parsing and interpretation."]},{"title":"110 0 0 O 0 @ 0 @ 0 0 0 0 0 @ 0 0 0 @ @ O 0 O 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 O O 0 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O @ O O ® O O O O O O O O O @ O O O O O O O O","paragraphs":["Our theory is a formal one, therefore we can rely on well-known, rule-driven, parsing methods developed for sentences which allows us ~parse discourse incrementally as it unfolds. In order to do so, our framework formalizes the relationship among constituent units in the discourse by specifying how ant tecedent units provide context for the interpretation of later units. In all cases, our method involves computing the resulting meaning of the combina-tion of the meanings of the combined units, rather than identifying appropriate labels under which to characterize the relationship obtaining between the units. Our units of analysis are welldefined semantic units. These units are usually encoded as single simple sentences or clauses but may also be realized by words, phrases or gestures which communicate exactly one elementary predication.","In our view, a formal theory of discourse structure should give well defined structures on which inferencing operates and on which world know, ledge applies. We strive to limit the role of world knowledge in so far as possible to a specific moment in d~;ourse processing--namely at the precise moment when a choice must be made about how a newly incoming unit must be integrated into the unfolding discourse. Just as in sentence grammar where world knowledge is used to decide between syntacticaUy equivalent alternatives in the case of pp attachment, for example, in discourse grammar the relationshilm between elements are purely grammatical, and world knowledge is only used to decide between syntactically equally reasonable alternatives.","Similarly, in calculating the structure of discourse, we do not rely on the use of cue words suchas so, angtway or thcfefor~ because these terms are never obligatory. The relationsl~p of one unit to another is always calculated on the relationshlp between the meanings of the constituent utterances which may then be ~in¢orced by the presence of terms which specify the nature of the intended relationship.","In the framework developed below, thea-e is a dose relationship I~en discourse rderents and discourse structure. We deal both with how anaphors are resolved to partienb, r antecedents using the structure of the discourse, and how an antecedent gives me,,nlng to an anaphor. The problem of identifying the antecedent to which an anaphor refe~ is dealt with in Centering Theory, discussed in Section 2 below. After reviewing Centering, we will discuss Dynamic Quantifier Logic (Section 3) and then show how the insights of Centering can be integrated into a benera] theory of discourse syntactic and semantic structure (Section 5.1), We shall point out how our approach accounts for multiple anaphors to different antecedents as well as ac~tmting for anaphoric reference to multiple antecedents, a problem which remain unsolved within that framework (5.2). 2 Centering Theory CenteringTheory first described in detail in Gro~z, Joshi and Weinstein (1983, 1986 [1995]) is designed to provide an assignment of a preference order among discourse entities in a sentence for the purpose of anaphora resolution. Centering Theory, which built upon earlier work by Joshi and Kuhn (1979) and Joshi and Weinstein (1981, 1998), proposed that (1) is perceived to be more coherent than (2) because in (1) (I) (a) JeH helped Dick wash the mr.

Centers are semantic entiUes • that ~re part of the discourse model for each utterance in a discourse segment.

In particular: the grammatical hierarchy with subjects ranking higher than objects (Grosz, Joshi, Weinstein 1983), topic or empathy marking (Kameyama 198,5), surface order position 111 (Rainbow, 1993) or grammatical function (Brennan, Friedman and Pollard 1987) of the encoding of discourse entities in the immediately preceding segment.","Roberts (1998) argues that C0 is an unordered set-of backward-looking centers in terms of classical Discourse Representation Theory notions of familiarity, compatibility and logical accessibility (Kamp 1981, Helm 1982, Kamp and Reyle 1993, Asher 1993), with an additional constraint that the set of discourse referents are attentionally accessible, a notion taken from Grosz and Sidner (1986). Under Roberts' treatment, the set of preferred centers, takes the place of the original C6. Walker (1998) also replaces a unique Ct with a set of possible backward looking centers computed from a set of possible forward looking centers using agreement features, selection constraints of the verb and contra-indexing conditions.","The choice of segment also remains contested ground in Centering, with mint linguists choosing for the sentence or clause while Walker (1998), argues for integrating Centering with a more global model of discourse focus.

Referring back to the set of hats is much more computationally expensive than referring back to the set of girls; to refer to the hats we must implicitly refer to the girls relative to which the set of hats is defined.","A consequence of the fact that the hats are introduced relative to the g/r/s, is that there is an implied ordering of the discourse referents that we use in reletting back to these sets.

To refer correctly to the set of cars, we must also refer indirectly to the set of women since we are interested in retrieving only the cars owned by the women, not cars owned by men.

Different approaches to centering will be better or worse at predicting ordering relations depending on the match between the ordering scheme decided upon and the underlying scopal ordering.","We argue as follows.","If the discourse referent A is introduced by a term that has scope over a term introducing discourse refe~.nt B, and discourse zefe~ent B is introduced by a term that has scope over discourse referent C, A will be preferred over B and B will be preferred. over C. Since this explanation is not dependent on conventions that might be different in different languages our treatment is universal. This is not the case for explanations based on linear ordexing of syntactic constituents or arguments based on gemnmatical function, for example. Because in .Engli~ the subject has scope over the objects, and the objects have scope over more deeply embedded terms, the ordering of discourse rderents familiar to us from the literature will result in the well known C! predictions.","Rejecting a preferred ordering for a less preferred ordering is a computationally complex operation.

In particular, Dynamic Quantifier Logic, the anaphora resolution mechanism based on quantifier scope we are working with here, has been designed to provide the semantic machinery for the Linguistic Discourse Model (LDM). The LDM provides an account for discourse interpretation in terms of structural and semantic relations among the linguistic constituents making up a discourse e. 5.1 The Linguistic Discourse Model The LDM is designed as a discourse ~ designed to construct a meaning representation of the input discourse icrementally.

Computationally, dur-ing parsing, a rich data structure is created representing the meaning of the discourse. This, we would argue, is a distinct advantage of Dynamic Semantic approaches such as the LDM/DQL system over current computational alternatives such as Discourse Structures Theory (Gro.~ and Sidner 1989) and Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson 1987) which rely upon inferring the at- - tentional and intentional states of language users, in one case, and on labe!ing the coherence relations among clauses, in the other. Looking towards formal discourse syst~m-__q, we believe that while it would be possible to integrate the insights of DQL into a DRT approach such as that t~ by Asher (1993), the appr.~ taken here is computationally more tractable than more standard implementation of DRT for discourse parsing. The increased tractability results from the separation of discourse syntax and semantics which our approach imposes, taken together with the restriction of appeals to inference and world knowledge to specific moments in interpretation. In the case of the LDM, appeals to external knowledge are made only at the moment of DCU attachment. to the parse.tree. • References","Nicholas Asher. 1993.
