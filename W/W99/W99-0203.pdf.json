For this purpose, in this paper, we propose a method to find coreferences between human names in the article of newspaper and human faces in the accompanying photograph. The method we proposed is based on the machine learning and the hypothesis driven combining method for identifying names and corresponding faces. Our experimental results show that the recall and precision rate of our method are better than those of the system which uses information exclusively from either text media or image media. 1"]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["In multimedia contents retrieval, almost all of researches have ibcused on information extracted from single media, e.g. (Han and Myaeng, 1996) (Smeaton and Quigley, 1996). These methods don't take into account semantic relations, like coreference between faces and names, holding between the contents of individual media. In order to retrieve multimedia contents with this kind of relations, it is necessary to find out such relations.","In this research, we use photograph news articles distributed on the Internet(Mai, 1997) and develop a system which identifies a person's name in texts of this type of news articles and her/his face on the accompanying photograph image, based on 1) the machine learning technology applied to individual media contents to build decision trees which extract face regions and human names, and 2) hypothesis based combining method for the results extracted by decision trees of 1). Since, in general, the number of candidates from image and that from language are more than one, the output of our system is the coreference between a set of face regions and a set of names.","There are many researches in the area of human face recognition (Rowley et al., 1996)(Hunke, 1994)(Yang et al., 1997)(Turk and Pentland, 1991) and human name extraction, e.g. (MUC, 1995). However, almost all of them deal with the contents of single media and don't take into account the combination of multimedia contents. As a case of combining multimedia contents, there is a research of captioned images (Srihari and Burhans, 1994) (Srihari, 1995). Their system analyzes an image and the corresponding caption to identify the coreference between faces in the image and names in the caption. The text in their research is restricted to captions, which describes contents of the corresponding images. However, in newspapers or photo news, captions don't always exist and long captions like the captions used in their research are rare. Therefore, in general, we have to develop a method to capture effective linguistic expressions not from captions but from the body of text itself.","In the research field of the video contents retrieval, although there are many researches ((Flickner et al., 1995),etc), few researches have been done to combine image and language media (Satoh et al., 1997)(Satoh and Kanade, 1997)(Smith and Kanade, 1997)(Wactlar et al., 1996)(Smoliar and Zhang, 1994) . In this field, as language media, there are soundtracks or captions in the video or sometimes in its transcriptions. For analysis of video contents, the information which consists along the time axis is effective and is used in such systems. On the other hand, for analysis of still images, some other methods that are different from the methods for video contents retrieval are required because the relatively small amount of and limited information than information from videos are provided.","In section 2, the background and our system's overview are stated. In section 3 and 4, we describe the language module and the image module, respectively. Section 5 describes the com-1\"1 bining method of the results of the language module and the image module. In section 6, the experimental results are shown. Section 7 is our conclusions. 2 System architecture for combining To find coreferences between names in the text and faces in the image of the same photograph news article, we have to extract human names from the text and recognize faces in the image (Figure 1)."]},{"title":"Photograph news article image","paragraphs":[":iiii~]~i:i::\" \"\"::!ili:i\" \"i:i:i:i ~ ...........

There-fore, we have to develop a method by which we automatically extracts a person whose name appears in the text and simultaneously his/her face appears on the image of the same article. For the convenience, we define common person, common name and common face as follows. Definition 1 A person whose name and face appear in the text of the article and in the photo image of the same article respectively, is called common person. The name of the common person is called common name, and the face of the common person is called common face.","This research is initiated by the intuition that is state as assumptions as follows:"]},{"title":"Assumption","paragraphs":["1 The name of a common person has a certain linguistic feature in the text distinct from that of a non common person."]},{"title":"Assumption","paragraphs":["2 The face of a common person has a certain image feature distinct from that of a non common person.","These two assumptions are our starting point to seek out a method to identify the difference between tlle way of appearing of common names or faces in each media and the way of appearing of non common names or faces, and assign certainties of commonness to names and faces respectively based on the above assumptions.","Since each media requires its proper processing methodology, our system has the language module to process the text and the image module to process the image. Our system also has the combining module which derives the final certainty of a name and a face from the certainty of name calculated by the language module and the certainty of face calculated by the image module respectively.","For the image module, it is necessary to use the resulting information given by the language module, such as the number of names of high certainty, because the features of regions like where and how large they are, depend on the number of common persons. For example, the image module should select the largest region if the language module extracts only one name. On the other hand, for the language module, it is also necessary to use the result we get from the image module, such as the number of faces of high certainty, to select names of the common person.","However, if we consider the nature of these in-teractive procedures between the language module and the image module, it is easily known that one module cannot wait until the completion of analysis of the other module. To resolve this situation, we consider two kinds of method."]},{"title":"Method","paragraphs":["1: First, the image (or language) module analyzes contents to proceed the process and outputs the partial results. Then assuming the result of the image (or language) module is correct, the language (or image ) module analyzes the text (or image). Needless to say, the assumed partial results might be wrong. In that case, the image (or language) module has to backtrack to resolve the conflict between the result of the image module and that of the language module. Namely, this method is a kind of search with backtrack and it also requires the threshold value by which the system decides whether the situation needs to backtrack or not. Moreover, the result depends on which media is analyzed first."]},{"title":"Method","paragraphs":["2: Before combining of the results of image processing and those of language processing, the system works out all the hypotheses about the number of common"]},{"title":"18","paragraphs":["persons. Using all of these hypotheses, the system selects the best combination of the results. Its strong advantages are 1) the optimal solution is always found, and 2) each module can process independently.","Considering the advantages and the shortcomings of two of the above described methods, it is reasonable to adopt Method 2. In this research, the hypotheses of the number of common persons are \"one\", \"two\" and \"more than two.\" The reasons of introducing \"more than two\" are the followings: the images containing four or more persons are very rare, and such images have similar features to the images containing three persons.

When the extracted name is a common name, the person is regarded as the important person in the article. Therefore, the linguistic expressions around the name probably have the specific linguistic features. Thus, our system decides whether an extracted name is a common name or not with information of the linguistic expressions around the human name. To select effective features for this purpose from the all features generated from the text, we employ a machine learning technique, because some important features could be fallen out if selected by hand. Moreover, machine learning technique might be able to learn incomprehensible phenomena for human.","It is hard to recognize meaningful linguistic features without morphological analysis. On the other hand, if the system does the syntax analysis, the handling of the ambiguity becomes a big problem. Furthermore, on the practical use, high processing cost becomes a problem to process huge amount of news articles. As the consequence, we adopt a word sequence pattern based approach. For this, firstly, we analyze texts of news articles with morphological analyzer JUMAN(version 3.6)(Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998) to extract the part of speech tags as the features in machine learning. Note that a compound noun is treated as one noun because if we treat component words of the compound noun individually, the patterns we have to deal with become too complicated for machine learning systems. The features to be used for learning are the followings. Compound noun which contains a human name The human name appearing in the news articles might have the adjacent words which describe additional information about the name such as title, age, year of birth and so on. The name with some kind of words, like title, sometimes becomes one compound noun and treated as one morpheme in our system. Our system tries to find this type of information as features for machine learning. Part of speech tags around a human name As well known, syntactic parsing is computationally heavy and usually has high ambiguities. Thus, instead of syntactic parsing, we extract the combination of a word, its part of speech tag and its relative position to the focused name for learning. Especially we focus on the words around the human name to capture the characteristic linguistic expressions about the human name. Our system employs two levels of the part of speech tag defined by the morphological analyzer JUMAN.","Since our system is for Japanese, object is described by a case particle. In pattern matching, instead of the sophisticated case analysis done by syntactic parsing, our system first applies the particle followed to the word as a feature. As for a predicate, we choose the predicate whose position is after the name and nearest to the name because in Japanese a predicate comes after subject, object, and other syntactic components. 19 Location and frequency of a human name Location of the word is important because it reflects structures of documents. Our system uses features as follows: 1) whether the word is in the title or not, 2) the line number of the line the word is in, and 3) the number of the paragraph the word is in. Our system also uses the order of the occurrence of the name in all the name occurrences and the frequency of the name in the text.","Using linguistic features described above extracted from training data as inputs, we use C5.0 (Rul, 1998) to generate decision trees. For each case in test data, C5.0 outputs th~ class predicted by the decision tree with the confidence of the prediction. We use the confidence as the output of this module.","Another factor for selecting feature for learning is how many morphemes around the name are used. In our experiment, ten morphemes around the name are used. The experimental results will be shown in section 6.","4 Extraction of human face candidates To identify coreferences between the face in the image and the name in the text, this module should extract regions that are candidates of common face. In this section, we describe the image module which extracts face candidates from the image. The face candidates are the faces of persons who might be common persons. Next, as same as the language module does, this module learns the characteristic features of the region of a common face that are used to decide whether an extracted region as a face is a common face or not. 4.1 Extraction of face regions To extract face regions, this module uses the following methods: 1) Filtering to remove noise, and 2)"]},{"title":"RGB","paragraphs":["based modeling of skin color to extract face region.

As for common face extraction, we did three fold cross-validation for the set of color photograph images which are contained by the articles used by the language module.
