Linguistic constraints are provided mostly by the syntactic modeling of language, whereas computational models of discourse bring forward the cognitive aesumplions of anaphora resolution. Three different methods of combining anaphoric constraints am known to date. The Rrst one integrates anaphora resolution in computational models of discourse interpretation. Dynamic properties of discourse, especially focusing and centering are invoked as the primary b~-~|~ for identifying antecedents. Such computational methods were presented in (Grosz et al., 1995) and (Webber, 1988).","A second category of approaches combines a v~ riety of syntactic, semantic and discourse factors as a multi-dimensional metric for ranking antecedent candidates. Anaphora resolution is determined by a composite of several distinct scoring procedures, each of which scores the prominence of the candidate with respect to a specific.type of information. The systems described in (Asher and Wada, 1988) (Carbonell and Brown, 1988) and (Rich and Luperfoy, 1988) are examples of the mixed evaluation strategy.","Alternatively, other discourse-based methods consider co~eference resolution a by-product of the recognition of coher~ce relations between sentences. Such methods were presented in (Hoblm et al., 1993) and ~flensky, 1978). Although M-complete, this approach has the appeal that it resolves the most complicated cases of coreference, uncovered by syntactic or semantic cues. We have revisited these methods by setting the relation between coreference and coherence on empirical grounds. 2.1 Pronominal Coreference Two tendencies characterize current pronominal coreference algorithms. The first one makes use of the advances in the parsing technology or on the availability of large parsed corpora (e.g. Trcebank (Marcus et al.1993)) to produce algorithms inspired by Hobbs' baseline method (Hobbs, 1978). For example, the"]},{"title":"Resolution of Anaphor~ Procedure (RAP)","paragraphs":["i~itroduced in (Lappin and Leass, 1994) combines syntactic information with agreement and salience constraints. Recently, a probabilistic approach to pronominal coreference resolution was also devised (Ge et al., 1998), using the parsed data available from Treebank. The knowledge-based method of Lappin and Leass produces better results. Nevertheless, RkPSTAT, a version of RAP obtained by using statistically measured preference patterns for the antecedents, prodticed a slight enhancement of performance over RAP.","Other pronominal resolution approaches promote knowledge-poor methods (Mitkov , 1998), either by using an ordered set of general heuristics or by combining scores assigned to candidate antecedents. The CogNIAC algorithm (Baldwin, 1997) uses six heuristic rules to resolve coreference, whereas the algorithm presented in (Mitkov, 1998) is based on a limited set of preferences (e.g. definitiveness, lexical reiteration or immediate reference). Both these algorithm rely only on part-of-speech tagging of texts and on patterns for NP identification. Their performance (dose to 90% for certain types of pronouns) indicates that full syntactic knowledge is not required by certain forms of pronominal coreference.","The same claim is made in (Kennedy and Bogu-","raev, 1996) and (Kameyama, 1997), where algorithm~ approximating RAP for poorer syntactic input obtain precision of 75% and 71%, respectively, a surprising small precision decay from RAP's 86%.

Table 5: Examples of 3rd person pronouns 2.2 Nominal Coreference Noun phrases can represent referring expressions in a variety of cases. For example, it is known that not all definite NPs are anaphoric. Conditions that define anaphoric NPs are still under research (cf. (Poesio and Vieira, 1998)). In the tagged corpora, we have found only 20.93% of the nominal coreference cases to be definites, the majority (78.85%) be-ing bare nominals 2, and only 1.32% were inclefiuites. However, more than 50% of the nominal referring expressions were names of people, org~n!-~tions or locations. Adding to this, 15.22% of nominal coreference links are accounted by appositives.
