It conveys how individual statements are connected within documents, across documents and across bodies of human knowledge. Consequently coreference resolution algorithms are at the core of Natural Language Processing. Most of the work done on coreference deals with a single language and a single text document (usually newswire).","As NLP research matures into \"application\" phases (as opposed to theory-development), NLP systems are moving beyond traditional research sources to document sets which reflect a more natural, research-oriented mix. This shift can be seen in both the document sets and tasks used in recent HUB, MET, and TDT evaluations. The new sources consist of documents in several different languages, documents with data from noisy sources, and documents containing multimedia. In order for NLP systems to make a successful transition to these new sources, it is critical for coreference resolution systems to also work on these new sources.","The Workshop on Coreference and Its Applications, held on June 22nd, 1999 at the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, USA, was organized around the goals of discussing, promoting, and presenting new research results (positive and negative) regarding the theory, design and evaluation of coreference resolution systems that deal with non-traditional data sources. In particular, the goal of the workshop was to focus on systems dealing with the following types of coreference: • Cross-document coreference • Coreference resolution in languages other than English • Coreference resolution on noisy data • Coreference resolution on non-text data (example: human speech) • Coreference resolution on multimedia data In addition, the workshop also focused on innovative NLP applications that rely heavily on coreference resolution systems. The workshop was sponsored by the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).","We would like to thank all authors who showed their interest by submitting papers to the workshop. We would also like to thank the members of the program committee: Branimir Boguraev (IBM Research), Ed Hovy (USC Information Sciences Institute), Mark T. Maybury (MITRE), and Ruslan Mitkov (University of Wolverhampton).
