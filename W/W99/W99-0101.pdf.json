Generally, a presupposition is satisfied in a context if the context contains a specific type of information and is organized in such a way that this information can be retrieved by the interlocutors. The model of discourse context we develop assumes that discourse structure is organized around a stack of questions under discussion, which plays a crucial role in narrowing the search for referents and other presupposed information. The algerithmA for maintaining the discourse structures and retrieving presupposed information are presented and illustrated by several example dialogues in which human users interact with an agent tomake hotel reservatious. I Introduction","\"Any theory of referring expressions must take into account the discourse context in which they ot~ur. Indeed, previous research has shown that the hierarchical organization of discourse is fundamentally related to the rderence resolution process. In this paper, we show how a highly structured discourse model, in conjunction with a treatment of referring expressions as presuppmitional, enables us to develop a common strategy for z~olving a number of reference resolution problems, such as pronominal anaphora and definite descriptions. We also out-line how this approach extends to a larger group of phenomena which we take to be presuppositional,. including domain restriction, ellipsis, and lexically and syntactically triggered presuppositions. All of these constructions are presuppositional in a broad sense, in that their use assumes that certain informarion can be retrieved from the discourse context. RecoL, nlzing the structure of the discourse will therefore play a crucial role in narrowing the search for referents and other presupposed information. We will illustrate our approach with four example human-computer dialogues, shown below.

This example is similar to the well-known examples of long-distance anaphora in task-oriented dialogues described by Grosz (1981). Our approach is consistent with previous research that uses the intentional structure of discourse to determine a set of potential antecedents for pronominal anaphora. The following examples will illustrate how a broader range of reference and presuppositional constructions may also be addressed by using the discourse structure to guide the search for relevant information.

As in Grosz & Sidner (1986), discourse is organized by the interlocutors' goals and intentions and the plans, or strategies, which conversational participants develop to achieve them. Following Stalnaker (1979), the primary goal of the language game is communal inquiry, i.e., interlocutors attempting to share information about their world, with the repository of that shared information characterized as the interlocutors' common groun~ CG. The set of acceptable moves in the game are defined by the (conventional and conversational) rules of the game, and are classified on the basis of their relatio_n~blp to the goals. Ignoring imperatives, there are two main types of moves (see also Carlson 1983): questions and assertions. If a question is accepted by the interlocutors, this commits them to a common dis(x)ur~ goal, l~lding a satisfactory (asserted) answer; like the commitment to a goal in Planning Theory, thiA strong commitment persists until the goal is satJ'~ed or else shown to be unsatisfi~le. The accepted question becomes the immediate topic of discussion, the quest/on under discussion. An assertion is a move which proposes an addition of information to the CG.","Roberts defines the structure of a discourse at a given point, its Information"]},{"title":"Structure,","paragraphs":["as a tupie which includes (among other things) the ordered set of moves in the discourse (M), CG, and the set of the questions currently under discussion at that point (QUD). The QUD is ordered by order of ute â€¢ terance and is updated in a stack-!i!~ f~b!on, I with questions popped when they are answered (or def.-mined to be practically unanswerable). The ordered set of questions under disc~-_~f~on corresponds to the hierarchical intentional structure of the discourse. The QUD in this structure constitutes the set of d/sco,rse goa/s of the interlocutors; the dis. course goals are only a subset of the set of common .goals of the interlocutors, their domain goals, and","1 However, all elements of the QUD list are accessible dur. ing the interpretation of an utterance.

Hence, the requirement that interlocutors stick to the question under discussion is just an instance of the more general commitment to plans; and in turn, in a fully integrated theory we would expect that domain goals and plans would influence interpretation as directly as the discourse goals represented by the questions under discussion.","Any move in a discourse game is interpreted with respect to the Information Structure of the discourse at that point. There are two main aspects to the interpretation of any given move: its presupposed content and its proffered content, the latter including what is asserted in an assertion and the non-presupposed content of questions and commands. When an utterance presupposes a proposition p, then in order for the utterance to be felicitous in the context, p must be entailed by the CG (Staluaker 1979). But in addition, any move in a discourse is interpreted by interlocutors under the Gricean met, a-presupposition of Relevance, with Relevance formally defined as follows in Roberts' framework:","(1) A move m is Relevant to the question under discussion q iff (i) m is an assertion such that CGU{m} entails a partial answer to q, or (ii) m is a question whose complete answer contextually entails a partial answex to q.","(10)) tells us that the interpretation of an assertion will be constrained so as to yield a partial answer (possibly via contextual entailment) to the question under discussion. (l(ii)) tells us that the Q UD in a felicitous Information Structure is constrained by Relevance so that each question on the QUD must address the (prior) question below it on the stack. Of course, (1) correctly predicts a variety of classical Gricean conversational implicatures, now characterizable as contextual entailments. But Roberts argues that Relevance is also crucial in presupposition resolution, broadly construed to include anaphora resolution, the interpretation of ellipsis, and domain restriction"]},{"title":"(Roberts 1995),","paragraphs":["as well as","lexically and syntactically triggered presuppositions.

These two constraints sufllce to characterize the presuppositional content of definite descriptions:","(3) Presuppositions of Definite Descriptions (informal): Given a context C, use of a definite description NPi presupposes that there is a discourse referent weakly familiar in C which is the unique weakly familiar discourse referent which satisfies the (possibly contextually restricted) descriptive content of NP/.","Unlike Russell's (1905) theory, this does not generady entail semantic uniqueness, although in certain special contexts it will yield the same effect via pragmatic means. Definite descriptions may have their descriptive content contextually enriched in the same way that domain restriction works for operators generally, i.e., via Relevance to the question under discussion. This will be illustrated in our discussion of example 4 below. Many apparent counter-examples to the presupposition of uniqueness for definite descriptions are solved by appeal to this principled contextual enric]~ment, as discussed at length in Roberts (1999). Pronouns carry an additional presuppomtion of maxima] salience:","(4) Presuppositions of Pronmmm (informal): Given a context C, use of a pronoun Pros presuplz3ses that there is a discourse referent i in C which is the unique weakly familiar discourse referent that is both maximally salient and satisfies the descriptive content suggested by the person, number and gender of Proi.","This amounts to an additional, conventional restriction on the search space for pronominal antecedents, implemented along the general lines suggested by Grosz & Sidner, and explains the differential distribution of pronouns and definite descriptions. We will discuss how m~-~dmal salience is implemented in terms of the QUD stack in Â§4. These presuppositional constraints result in a straightforward theory of anaphoric reference which explains a broad range of data and can be extended to a treatment of demonstrative NTs as definites, as well. - 3 process_utterance (U) \"/:1:1. 1.

Of central importance in this process is the maintenance of the QUD stack. Each entry on the stack is represented by a Question Data Log (QDL), an ordered triple which contains the utterance's logical form (ULF), its Contextually Under-stood LF (CULF), and a set of current discourse referents (CDRS). QDL entries represent i~orma-tion about units of discourse structure which roughly correspond to the discourse segments developed by Grosz and Siduer.","Process.utterance is the top-level function in-yoked for each discourse utterance.

After resolve_term has processed a presuppositional term, the variable that it binds will appear on the CDRS list, and will either be identified with a set of referents from the common ground or be tmanchored (indicated by the empty set or '?'). Once the CULF and CDRS are determined, the discourse structures, including the CG and QUD, are updated, depending.on the type of conversational move (i.e., assertion or question).

We claim that at any time there is a set of accessible entities in the discourse, and when a pronoun is used in a discourse felicitously (i.e., as constrained by Relevance), there needs to be a unique maximally salient discourse referent for the pronoun belonging to this set of accessible entities. Under our approach; the set of accessibh entities is represented by the union of the CDRS sets of all entries on the QUD stack.

Our overall approach could be adapted to use any theory of local coherence to determine a partial ordering over the CDRS within a discourse segment corresponding to a single QUD, but it is similar to Suri and McCoy's approach in allowing the CDRS of prior questions to be stacked. Further explanation of how centering constraints can be integrated with our approach is given by Roberts (1998). In our implementation of pronoun resolution (see Figure 2), the function r=-lr.accessible_referents gives the partial ordering of the accessible entities from the QUD, filtering out all entities that are incompatible with the agreement features of the pronoun, which are represented in the restriction component of a pronoun term.","In processing this dialogue, the system treats (I) as a question (requests and statements of need and desire should be coerced to questions), and produces (CDRS I), which is the set of discourse referents mentioned in sentence (1). (CDRS 1) {(x:person user)(y:hotel ?)(z:date D1)(w~.city NYC)} As the system attempts to find out more specific information (imagine that it is filling out a template), it asks subquestions, such as (2), (4), and (6). After each subquestion, a new entry is added on top of the QUD stack, and therefore a new CDRS as well, e.g., the set of discourse referents in the top QUD entry aRer (2) is (CDRS 2). (CDRS 2) ((w:city NYC)(x:area ?)(y.-perso n nser)} When a subquestion is answered, as in (3), the CDRS of the current QUD is updated, e.g., the referent (x:area ?) becomes (x:area Manhattan), and a new referent introduced in the answer is added: (z:area CentralPark). However, once a question is completely answered it is popped off the stack. Thus, after (3) is completely processed as an answer to (2), the stack is popped, and subquestious are also popped after processing (5) and (7). Therefore, when we arrive at (8), the QUD stack is just as it was aRer (I), since all of the intervening subquestions have been popped.

On the other hand, if it turns out that there are either no hotels named Holiday Inn in the database, or multiple Holiday Inns, the system could report the failure of these presuppositions, rather than giving an uninformative simple negative answer to the user's question (1). 4.3 Generalized Dom~|n Restriction:","Example HI Consider next the quantificational definer ever// in sentence (3) of example HI. It should be clear that the user is not ~.qld~ about every morning for all time, hut only about all mornings during the planned trip. As with definite descriptions, our algorithm allows the restriction of most operators with semantically contentfifl restrictions i to be further specified by information from the QUD, so the interpretation of every morn/rig will differ depending on whether the dialogue began with question (la)","or (Ib).

In this case, we take the basic type to be a temporal entity, so it will search for temporal descriptions in the QUD. s By using the QUD stack to constrain the search, every Will quantify over any temporal entities that are found at a level of discourse structure closest to the current segment, but crucially not over every tern- â€¢ poral entity in the entire common ground. Thus, to determine the response in:(4a), only the date range mentioned in (la) is relevant, and a positive response can be given, since the question relates to weekdays. In (4b) however, the date range includes a Saturday, so the system should generate a negative response. 4.4 Elliptical Questions: Example IV","Example IV is a somewhat more complex dialogue, including an elliptical question as well as several definite descriptions.

We have found that requests and statements of need and desire should be coerced to questions, but a general implementation of this coercion process remains to be completed. An even more challenging problem involves inferring the domain goals of the user that are related to the question under discussion. As will be readily apparent to most researchers in NLP, these problems are intertwined with larger AI problems, such as plan recognition, which are beyond the scope of this paper, but must ultimately be solved or approximated in any realistic application. As noted in our discussion of domain restriction (Â§4.3), it is sometimes possible to extract some explicitly mentioned content from the QUD which is relat~ to the user's domain goals, but we recoL,-i~e that this is only an apprarlmate solution.","Although we have shown several examples where this approach to discourse structure is successful, a comprehensive empirical evaluation still needs to be performed to dete _rm_in_e how frequently particular presupposition problems occur in actual corpora, and to assess what proportion of the actual occurrences are resolved effectively by our algorithms.
