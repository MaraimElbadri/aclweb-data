While there has been some work on generating appmwiate refening expressions, little attention has been given to the problem of when a pronoun should be used to ref= to an object. In most instances the assumption has been that a pronoun should be generated when referring to a discourse entity that is highly prominent (accessible). However, a study of naturally occurring texts reveals that factors beyond accessibility must be ~g*n into account in order to explain the patterns of pronoun use found.","Other researchers have indicated that fuller descriptions tend to bbe found at the beginning of discourse segments (Grosz & Sidaer, 1986; Reichman, 1985), even when the object being referred to is extzemely prominent in the preceding sentence.

For generation, the discourse segment boundary must be part of the input to a sentence generator (which, we assume, is responsible for making the referring expression choice). To evaluate proposals for generating referring expressions, the discourse segment boundary must also be recognizable.","While discourse segment boundaries may be important, note that fuller noun phrases are sometimes used when there is no discourse segment boundary (under any reasonable definition of boundary). This may occur when the referent is not accessible because the nearest antecedent is too far away or because it is confusable with another referent. We attempt to explain such instances as well.","In order to determine the circuntctances under which to choose a pronoun versus a definite descripfiont0 our tack has been to study naturally occurring examples and to try to hypothesize rules that explain the reference forms in those examples. To date we have concentrated our study on New York Times news articles. We hope to generalize some of our findings to other types of text genres as well.","Consider the following passage from the first several lines of one.of the stories we analyzed: EaJmple 1:","When Kenneth L. Curtis was wheeled into court nine years ago, mute, dull-eyed and crippled, it seemed clear to nearly everyone involved that it would be pointless t o put him on trial for the murder of his former girlfriend,","'We use the term definite description to mean either a definite noun phrase or a name.."]},{"title":"63","paragraphs":["Donna Kalson, and the wounding of her companion.","It had beenayear since Mr. Curtis had slammed his pickup truck into them, breaking their legs. He then shot them both and, finally, fired a bullet into his own brain. Mr. Curtis fingered in a coma for months, then awoke to a world of paralysis, pain and mental confusion from which psychiatric experts said he would never emerge.","One expert calculated his I.Q. at 62 .....","For convenience, we have indicated all references to the main character in bold.","A surprising thing to note about this passage is that not all of the anaphoric references to Mr. Curtis are pronouns even though he is arguably the focus of every sentence included. Some previous work on pronoun generation would predict that a pronoun should be used if the same item remains in focus. Thus it appears that something other than a straightforward application of focusing or other pronoun resolution algorithms is necessary. • A second thing to note about this passage is that the sentences are generally long and complex and often conrain several references to the same character. These types of sentences are very different from those that have been considered by any generation system that has rules for generating pronouns. In addition, it is not clear how most focusing or pronoun interpretation algorithms would handle them.","One hypothesis that might be made is that the under-lying structure of the text might affect pronoun generation. Care must be taken in choosing such a structure. The chosen structure must (1).explain the patterns of pronouns found in naturally occurring text' and (2) be based on information available to a sentence generation system. Notice that constructs such as paragraph breaks meet neither of these criteria.","In this work we hypothesize that discourse structure (segmentation) is indeed vital in the decision of whether or not to generate a pronoun. However, we argue that a single definition of disburse segment is not sufficient to explain the patterns of pronoun use found, and seek a more general notion. Here, to distingni~h o~ notion from other notions of discmuse segmentation found in the literature (e.g., Reidmum (1985) or Grosz & Sidner (1986)), we use the term discomae thread to capture the structuring notion to whidz we refer. We propose that a discourse generally contains multiple threads which run through the discourse and can serve to structure the discourse. In general, a single thread is evident at a particular point in the discourse, but this thread may be replaced by another thread and then picked up again at another point in the discourse (cf. Ros6 et al. (1995)). The \"threading device\" used to structure will be different for different kinds ofdisc0urses. For instance, in the kinds of discourses studied in Grosz & Sidner (1986) the thread-ing device may be the intentional structures (and each of their discourse segments would constitute a thread of the discourse), in the discourses that we studied (New York Times a~cles), threads defined in terms of the time referenced in a clause appeared to be quite prominent.","In this paper we present our preliminary work in uncovering factors that affect pronoun generation decisions. Our work so far has led us to hypothesize several factors including:","Sentence Boundaries - pronouns appear to be the preferred referring form for subsequent reference to an item within the same sentence.","Distance from Last Mention - when the last mention • of an item is several sentences back in the text' a definite description is preferred.","Discourse Structure in terms of multiple threads - when the previous reference to an item is in the same thread as the current reference, a pronoun is preferred. A definite description is preferred when the threads are differenC","Ambiguity - potential ambiguity must be taken into account when choosing an anaphoric expression in that a pronoun should only be generated if it can be resolved correctly.","In the next section we discuss previous research on pronoun generation. \"finis is followed by a discussion of some anaphoric expressions that do not require considering discourse structure to generation. This is followed by an introduction of time as a slructuring device which affects pronoun generation. Next we investigate ambiguous anapboric references. We follow this with an algorithm which decides when to use a pronoun versus a definite description when referring to some discourse entity. After this, we report on empirical results of the application of our algorithm to a corpus of New York Tunes articles. Finally, we provide some/~'i'~ted work, future research, and conclusions. 2 Previous Work on Pronoun Generation Few researchers have given serious consideration to the problem of pronoun generation. The most common factot considered has been the accessibility of the refer-eaL If the referent is sufficiently prominent in the ceding text, a pronoun is usecL Some early generation work (e.g., McDonald (1980), McKeown (1983), McKeown (1985), Appelt (1981)) used a simple mleto implement this idea based on focus (Sidner, 1979) that roughly stated that if the current sentence is about the same thing that the previous sentence was about, use a pronoun to refer to that thing. As was pointed out above, this rule does not provide a very good match with the referring expressions in our corpus.","Dale (1992)also ~ the generation of pronouns in the context of work on generating referring expressions (Appelt' 1985; Reiter, 1990).

As an example of the kinds of texts he generated consider: \"Soak the butterbeaus. Drain and rinse them.\" Such an account of pronoun generation, based on center constancy, appears to work quite well in the domain Dale considered. However, as pointed out in Example 1, it does not seem to explain the patterns found in the texts we analyzed.","The centering model (Orosz et al., 1995) itself makes predictions about pronoun generation only in a specific instance - that where Rule 1 is appficeble. Centering's Rule 1 states that if any element of the previous utterance's forward looking center list is realized in the current utterance as a pronoun, then the backward looking center must be realized as a pronoun as well (Grosz et al., 1995. p.214). Notice that the Mr. Curtis at the beginning of the second sentence in Example I is an apparent violation of this rule. But, more generally, we must have a theory that is able to handle all cases of pronoun use.","A pronoun interpretation algorithm based on centering which relied on centering transition preferences was developed in Brennan et aL (1987)~ Using transition preferences in a pronoun generation rule would cover more cases of pronoun use than is covered by Rule 1, but the application of such transition preferences also proved unhelpful in explaining pronoun patterns in our corpus.","Reichman (1985) and Grosz & Sidner (1986) indicate that discourse segmentation has an effect on the linguistic realization of referring expressions. While this is intuitively appealing, it is unclear how to apply this to the generation problem (in part because it is unclear how to define discourse segments to a generation system).

While Passonneau's algorithm seems quite appealing, notice that it provides no explanation of how a discourse segment should be defined. The evaluation that she provided used the discourse segments provided by aset of naive subjects who indicated discourse segment boundaries in her texts. Without such boundaries provided, it is impossible to apply her algoritlun.

On the other hand, we differ from Passonneau in that we do not attempt to make use of focus spaces in generation. Rather we argue for evaluating informational adequacy on the basis of confusable objects near the current sentence in a discourse.","In the following section we hypothesize that discourse structure in terms of multiple threads does have an effact on appropriate anaphoric expression choice and that the temporal structure of a discourse is a particular instantiation of these threads (in the stories that we have analyzed).

In short-distance situations a pronoun is almost always used (except in situations where this pronoun is ambiguous).

Since a shift in time scale is often indicated by linguistic means and the time being referred to must be part of the input to a sentence generator, we concentrated on this point. We also acknowledge that the changes in time seem quite important in the news stories that we analyzed. Other genres of text might depend on other kinds of structuring devices.","Changes in time scale or time, as we redefined the category, may require world knowledge reasoning to recoguize but are often indicated by either cue words and phrases (e.g., \"n/he years ago \", \" a year\", \"for months'; \"several months ago\"), a change in .grammatical time of the verb (e.g., past tense versus present tense), or changes in aspect (e.g., atomic versus extended events versus states as defined by Moens & Steedman (1988)).","In considering how time change might affect anaphoric expression choice, we consider the choice for the first mention of a discourse entity in a sentence where that entity has recently been referred to in the discourse. Our hypothesis is that: Changes in time reliably signal changes of the thread in newspaper articles; definite descriptions should appear when the current reference to a discourse entity is in a different thread from the last reference to that entity and pronouns should occur when the previous mention is in the same thread 3.","In order to evaluate this hypothesis, we mapped out the time being referenced in our texts on a clause-by-clause basis. For each clause in the texts we indicated the time which was referred to. We distinguished between events that occurred at a single instance in time (atomi c events) and events or states that occurred over a span of time (repeated atomic events, extended events, and states). For atomic events we allowed for both a specific time at which it occurred and for a non-specific time that indicated the range of uncertainty.

Dale (1992) generated referring expressions so that their referents could be distinguished from the other discourse entities mentioned in the context. This strategy can be interpreted as: Generate a pronoun whenever it is not ambiguous. However, how one should define context is not quite clear. For this definition we choose a span of text considered important in our previous work on anaphora resolution (Slrube, 1998), and define a referring expression as ambiguous if there is a competing antecedent (i.e. another discourse entity matching in number and gender) mentioned in the previous sentence or to the leR of the referring expression in the current sentence. Of the 437 referring expressions in the texts we analyzed, 104 were considered ambiguous by this definition. Of these only 51 were realized as a definite description. Thus a rule which specifies use of a definite description if a pronoun would be ambiguous according to this definition appears to be too strict. Therefore we need to consider ambiguous cases in more detail.","sNote that the use of this definite description cannot be explained by a topic shift since there is no topic shift in between the previous text and (49). At least two discourse entities (\"Mrs. Mandela\" and the \"football club\") are constant, only Mrs. Mandela's husband does not occur in the immediately preceding sentences.","Consider the following excerpt taken from later in the same story that contains Example i. For convenience. references to the main character appear in bold, while those to a competing antecedent appear in italics. Example 3:","Mr. Curtis might have lived out his live in obscurity if it were not for a New Haven television reporter. Jim Hoffer, of station WTNH. who got an anonymous tip last summer that Mr. Curtis had been attending college. Using a hidden camera, a crew taped Mr. Curlis going to his classes at Southern Connecticut State University, and a producer recorded a conversation with him in a cafeteria. In a clear, steady voice, Mr. Curtis can be heard to say that he...","Concentrating on the references to Mr. Curtis, we question when a pronoun can be used, and when the name should be used. To handle cases where competing antecedents occurred, we turned to pronoun resolution algorithms. Our intuition was that a pronoun could be generated to refer to a particular discourse entity if • a pronoun resolution algnr/thin woul d choose that entity as a referent for the pronoun. To our knowledge, there are only two focus-based pronoun resolution algorithms that are specified in enough detail to work on unrestricted naturally occurring text: Brennan et al. (1987) using the definition of utterance according to Kameyama (1998), and Struhe (1998). Strube evaluated the effectiveness of these two algorithms on the task of pronoun resolution in some naturally occurring texts. Because Strube's algorithm showed significantly better results, we have turned to it for guidance in pronoun generation.","The idea is that if we want to refer to a discourse entity, E, but there is a competing antecedent, C, we look to Strube'S algorithm in the following way. If Strube's algorithm would resolve a pronoun to be K we use a pronoun. If, instead, Strube's algorithm would prefer C as the referent of the pronoun, we would use a definite description to refer to ~-.","We evaluated this idea along with several other alternatives (e.g., using discourse structure alone, using long-and short-distance rules ignoring the ambiguity, distingnishing between first and subsequent reference within a sentence, using a definite description whenever there was ambiguity) on the ambiguous examples in our corpus. Our analysis showed that the use of Strube's algnrithm showed improvement, but it seemed to be too liberal with suggesting pronouns when the competing antecedent was in the previous sentence. Assuming Strube's algorithm reflects human processing of referring expressions (something NOT claimed), what this means is that in our texts the writer chose to generate a definite description even though a pronoun would have been in-formafionally adequate to resolve the referent correctly. This occurred most frequently over sentence boundaries. When a competing antecedcnt is within a sentence, how-ever, Strube's algorithm appears to be quite effective."]},{"title":"67","paragraphs":["• Thus the rule we .settled on acknowledged the importance of sentence boundaries and is shown in Figure 2.","I. if this is the first occurrence of X in the current sentence and","(a) /./'there is a competing antecedent in the previous sentence, use a definite description;","(b) /f there is a competing antecedent in the same sentence (i.e.. to the left) and i. if Struhe's algorithm would resolve a","pronoun in this position to be X. use a","pronoun; ii. e/se use a definite description;","2. /./'this is a subsequent occurrence of X in the current sentence and","(a) U\" there is an intervening competing an-","tecedent, use a definite description;","Co) ~ there is no intervening competing an-","t_ _,y~,,tttttJent, use a pronoun.

Nakhimovsky (1988) also uses changes in \"t̀ime scale\" as a marker for changes in time. We plan to investigate this to see whether it explains more of the examples. Nakhimovsky also describes several other markers for a setting change, and these will also be investigated to see if they are indicative of definite description use.","Another line of future research involves further in-vestigation of the ambiguous cases. Our current rule was developed by evaluating several different possibilities (e.g., using time change rules, different pronoun resolution algorithms) and selecting a rule that explains most of the cases. Still, the number of ambiguous cases is fairly small and analyzing more texts and concentrating on cases where the current rule makes an incorrect prediction may lead us to a more robust rule.","Finally, further thought must be put into evaluating the algorithm. In particular, our current evaluation methodology presupposes that the human writer has chosen the best anaphoric expression. It may be interesting to see if there are differences between reading time, eye movements, or comprehension of stories with the human-generated expressions and those using our algorithm. Thought must be put into setting up such experiments and into interpreting results. For example, a faster reading time may not indicate a better choice of referring expression (since the writer may have been interested in an effect other than ease of comprehension). On the other hand, such experiments have the potential for produc-ing a more adequate evaluation of the methodology than does mimicking the human-produced text and should be looked into further."]},{"title":"10 Conclusions","paragraphs":["Pronouns occur frequently in texts and have been hypothesized to play a significant role in text coherence. Yet, pronoun generation has not been studied in detail. If future natural language generation systems are to produce coherent, natural texts, they must use rules for generating pronouns that produce pronouns in roughly the same places that human-produced texts do. M~oreover, the rules must be based on informationthat would bc available to a sentence generator. At thesame time, in order to evaluate rules, they must be based on information that can be gleaned from a text.","In this work we have argued that discourse structure 69 in terms of multiple threads provides an explanation for patterns of pronoun use in naturally occurring text. As a particular instantiation of a threaded discourse Structure, we looked at changes in setting, as indicated by changes in time. That is, even in places where a pronoun would be unambiguous, a definite description might be used when the time of the sentence is different from the time of the sentence in which the previous mention was made. This hypothesis provides an explanation for many of the uses of definite descriptions found in the studied texts. Other uses of definite descriptions occur because of ambiguities. We have suggested a rule which addresses when such ambiguities should not preclude the generation \"of a pronoun. Our scheme appears to be a reasonable explanation for the patterns of pronoun use found in our corpus. Acknowledgments.
