A COLLECT module determines a list of potential antecedents (LPA) for each anaphor (pronoun, definite noun, proper name, etc.) that have the potential to resolve it,","2. A FILTER module eliminates referees incompatible with the anaphor f~m the LPA.","3. A PREFEI~NCE module detennm\" es the most likely antecedent on the basis of an Ordering policy. In most cases,, the COLLECT module determines an LPA by enumerating all antecedents in a window of text that pLeced__es the anaphor under scrutiny (Hobbs, 1978; Lappin and Leass, 1994; Mitkov, 1997; Kameyama, 1997; Ge et al., 1998). This window can be as small as two or three sentences or as large as the entire preceding text. The FILTER module usually imposes semantic constraints by requiring that the anaphor and potential antecedents have the same number and gender, that selectional restrictions are obeyed, etc. The PREFERENCE module imposes preferences on potential antecedents on the basis of their grammatical roles, parallelism, frequency, proximity, etc. In some cases, anaphora resolution systems implement these modules explicitly (I-Iobbs, 1978; Lappin and Leass, 1994; Mitkov, 1997; Kameyama, 1997). In other cases, these modules are integrated by means of statistical (Ge et al., 1998) or uncertainty reason-ing techniques (Mitkov, 1997).","The fact that current anaphora resolution systems rely exclusively on the linear nature of texts in Order to determine the LPA of an anaphor seems odd, given that several studies have claimed that there is a strong relation between discourse structure and reference (Sidner, 1981; Gmsz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et aL, 1995; Fox, 1987; Vonk et al., 1992; Azzam et al., 1998; Hitzeman and P .oesio, 1998). These studies claim, on the one hand, that the use of referents in naturally occurring texts imposes constmints on the interpretation of discourse; and, on the other, that the structure of discourse constrains the HAs to which anaphors can be resolved.

Since it is likely that both linear- and discourse-based anaphora resolution systems can implement similar FILTER and PREFERENCE strategies, we focus here only on the strategies that can be used to COLLECT lists of potential antecedents. Specifically, we focus on determining whether discourse theories can help an anaphora resolution system determine LPAs that are \"better\" than the LPAs that can be computed from a linear interpretation of texts. Section 2 outlines the theoretical as.~umptions of our empirical investigation. Section 3 describes our experiment. We conclude with a discussion of the results. 2 Background 2.1 Assumptions Our approach is based on the following assumptions:","1. For each anaphor in a text, an anaphora resolution s~,stem must produce an LPA that conrains a referent to which the anaphor can be resolved. The size of this LPA varies from system to system, depending on the theory a system implements.","2. The smaller the LPA (while retaining a correct antecedent), the less likely that errors in the FILTER and PREFERENCE modules will affect the ability of a system to select the appropriate referent.",". Theory A is better than theory B for the task of reference resolution if theory A produces LPAs that contain more antecedents to which anaphors can be correctly resolved than theory B, and if the LPAs produced by theory A are smaller than those produced by theory B. For example, if for a given anapbor, theory A produces an LPA that contains a referee to which the anaphor can be resolved, while theory B produces an LPA that does not contain such a referee, theory A is better than theory B. More-over, if for a given anaphor, theory A produces an LPA with two referees and theory B produces an LPA with seven referees (each LPA containing a referee to which the. anaphor can be resolved), theory A is considered better than theory B because it has a higher probability of solving that anaphor correctly. We •consider two Classes of models for determining the LPAs of anaphors in a text: Linearok models. This is a class of linear models in which the LPAs include all the references found in the discourse unit under scrutiny and the k discourse:ufiits that immediately precede it. Linear-O models an approach that assumes that all anaphors can be resolved intra-uuit; Linear-I models an appreach that corresponds roughly to centering (Grosz et aL, 1995). Linear-k is consistent with the assumptions that underlie most current anaphora resolution systems, which look back k units in order to resolve an anaphor. Discourse-VT-k models. In this class of models, LPAs include all the referential expressions found in the discourse unit under scrutiny and the k discourse units that hierarchically precede it. The units that hierarchically precede a given unit are determined according to Veins Theory (VT) (Cristea et al., 1998), which is described briefly below. 2.2 Veins Theory VT extends and formalizes the relation between discourse structure and reference proposed by Fox (1987). It identifies \"veins\", i.e., chains of elementary discourse units, over discourse stmctme trees that are built according to the requirements put forth in Rhetorical Sa-acture Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 198g).","One of the conjectures of VT is that the vein expression of an elementary discourse unit provides a coherent \"abstract\" of the discourse fragment that contains that unit. As an internally coherent discourse fragment, all anaphors and referential expressions (REs) in a unit must be resolved to referees that occur in the text subsumed by the units in the vein. This conjecture is consistent with Fox's view (1987) that the units that contain referees to which anaphors can be resolved are determined by the nuclearity of the discourse units that precede the anaphors and the.overall structure of discourse. According to VT, REs of both satellites and nuclei can access referees of immediately preceding nucleus nodes. REs of nuclei can only access referees of preceding nuclei nodes and of directly subordinated satellite nodes. And the interposition of a nucleus 47 after a satellite blocks the accessibility of the satellite for all nodes that are lower in the corresponding discourse structure (see (Cristea et el., 1998) for a full definition).","Hence, the fundamental intuition underlying VT is that the RST-specific distinction between nuclei and satellites constrains the range of referents to which anaphors can be resolved; in other words, the nucleus-satellite distinction induces for each anaphor (and each referential expression) a Domain of Referential Accessibility (DRA). For each anaphor a in a discourse unit u, VT hypothesizes that a can be resolved by examining referential expressions that were used in a subset of the discourse units that precede u; this subset is called the DRA of u. For any elementary unit u in a text. the corresponding DRA is computed automatically from the rhetorical representation of that text in two steps:",". Heads for each node are computed bottom-up over the rhetorical representation tree. Heads • of elementary discoune units are the units themselves. Heads of internal nodes, i.e., discourse spans, are computed by taking the union","• of the heads of the immediate child nodes that are nuclei. For example, for the text in Figure 1, whose rhetorical structure is shown in Figure 2, the head of span [5,7] is unit 5 because the head of the immediate nucleus, the elementary unit 5, is 5. However, the head of span [6,7] is the list (6,7) because both immediate children are nuclei of a multlnuclesr relation.",". Using the results of step 1, Vein expressions are computed top.down for each node in the tree. The vein of the root is its head. Veins of child nodes are computed recursively according to the rules described by Cristea et al.(1998). The DRA of a unit u is given by the units in the vein that precede u. For example, for the text and RST tree in Figures 1 and 2, the vein expression of unit 3, • which contains units 1 and 3, suggests that anaphors from unit 3 should be resolved only to referential expressions in units I and 3. Because unit 2 is a satellite to unit 1, it is considered to be \"blocked\" to referential links from unit 3. In contrast, the DRA of unit 9, consist-ing of units I, 8, and 9, reflects the intuition that anaphon from unit 9 can be resolved only to referential expressions from unit 1, which","1. l.~ch--/D. ,.,.]. cop ~oh.o.~oh~o. manager, moved co ~, a small b~o~chnology concern hero,","2. to becgme~t~ presLdent a'ncl chief ol~srlt~ng officer.

However, this does not create problems because we are focusing here only on co-referential relations of identity (see section 3). Since these relations induce equivalence classes over the set of referential expressions in a text, it is sufficient that an anaphor or referential expression is resolved to any of the members of the rulev-ant equivalence class, For example, according to VT, the referential expression Mr. Casey in unit 5 in Figure I can be linked directly only to the referee Mr Casey in unit !. because the DRA of unit 5 is { 1,5}.

Based on this information, we evaluated the potential of each of the two classes of models discussed in section 2 (Linear-k and Discourse-VT-k) to correctly estab- • lish co-referential links as follows: For each model, each k, and each marked referential expression a, we determined whether or not the corresponding LPA (defined over k elementary units) contained a referee from the same equivalence class. For example, for the Linear-2 model and referential expression the smaller company in unit 9, we estimated whether a co-referential link could be established between the smaller company and another referential expression in units 7, 8, or 9. For the Discourse-VT-2 model and the same referential expression, we estimated whether a co-referential link could be established between the smaller company and another referential expression in units 1, 8, or 9. which correspond to the DRA of unit 9.","To enable a fair comparison of the two models,","• when k is larger than the size of the DRA of a given unit, we extend that DRA using the closest units that precede the unit under scrutiny and are not already in the DRA. Hence, for the Linear-3 model and the referential expression the smaller company in unit 9, we estimate whether a co-referential link can be established between the smaller company and another referential expression in units 6, 7, 8, or 9. For the Discourse-VT-3 model and the same referential expression, we estimate whether a co-referential link can be established between the smaller company and another referential expression in units 1, 8, 9, or 7, which c:orrespond to the DRA of unit 9 (units 1, 8, and 9) and to unit 7, the closest unit preceding unit 9 that is not in its DRA.","For the Discourse-VT-k models, we assume that the Extended DRA (EDRA) of size k of a unit u (EDRAk(u)) is given by the first I < k units of a sequence that lists, in reverse order, the units of the DRA of u plus the k - I units that precede u but are not in its DRA. For example, for the text in Figme 1, the following relations hold: F_~RAo(9) = 9; F, DP, A~(9) = 9,8; F_,DRAa(9) = 9,8,1; EDP~(9) = 9, 8,1, 7; EDRA4(9) - 9, 8,1, 7, 6. For Linear-k models, the EDRAt(u) is given by u and the k units that immediately precede u.","The potential p( M, a, EDRAt) of a model M to determine correct co-referential links with respect to a referential expression a in unit u, given a corresponding EDRA of size k (EDRAt(u)), is assigned the value 1 if the EDRA contains a co-referent from the same equivalence class as a. Otherwise, p(M, a, EDRAk) is assigned the value 0. The potential p(M, C, k) of a model M to determine correct co-referential links for all referential expressions in a corpus of texts C, using EDRAs of size k, is computed as the sum of the potentials p(M, a, EDRAk) of all referential expressions a in C. This potential is normalized to a value between 0 and I by dividing p(M, 6\", k) by the number of referential expressions in the corpus that have an antecedent.","By examining the potential of each model to correctiy determine co-referential expressions for each k, it is possible to determine the degree to which an implementation of a given approach can contribute to the overall efficiency of anaphora resolution systems. That is, if a given model has the potential to correctly determine a significant percentage of co-referential expressions with small DR/is, an anaphora resolution system implementing that model will have to consider fewer options overall. Hence, the probabifity of error is reduced. 3.2.2 Results The graph in Figure 3 shows the potentials of the Linear-k and Discourse-VT-k models to correctly determine co-referential links for each k from 1 to 20. The graph in Figure 4 represents the same potentials but focuses only on ks in the interval [2,9]. As theze two graphs show, the potentials increase monotonically with k, the VT-k models always do-ing better than the Linear-k models. Eventually, for large ks, the potential performance of the two models converges to 100~.","The graphs in Figures 3 and 4 also suggest resolution strategies for implemented systems. For example, the graphs suggests that by choosing to work with EDRAs of size 7, a discourse-based system has the potential of resolving more thun 90~ of the co-referential links in a text correctly. To achieve the same potential, a linear-based system needs to look back 8 units. If a system does not look back at all and attempts to resolve co-referential links only within the unit under scrutiny (k -- 0), it has the potential to correctly resolve about 40~ of the co-referential links.","To provide a clearer idea of how the two models differ, Figure 5 shows, for each k, the value of the Discourse-VT-k potentials divided by the value of the Linear-k potentials. For k = 0, the potentials of both models are equal because both use only the unit in focus in order to determine cwreferential links.

However, from a computational perspective (and presumably, from a psycholinguistic perspective as well) it also makes sense to compare the effort required by the two classes of models to establish correct co-referential links. We estimate this effort using a very simple metric that assumes that the closer an an ~teo~__ent is to a corresponding referential expression in the EDRA, the better. Hence, in estimating the effort to estabfish a co-referential link, we treat EDRAs as ordered lists. For example, using the Linesr-9 model, to determine the correct antecedent of the referential expression the smaller company in unit 9 of Hgure 1, it is necessary to search back through 4 units (to unit 5, which contains the refezent Genet/c Therapy). Had unit 5 been Mr. Cosset succeeds M. James Barrett, .50, we would have had to go back 8 units (to unit 1 ) in order to correctly resolve the RE the smaller company.

As a consequence, for small ks the effort required to establish co-referential linksis similar for both theories, because both can establish only a limited number of links.

Our analysis suggests that by exploiting the hierarchical structure of texts, one can increase the potential of natural language systems to correctly determine co-referential links, which is a requirement for correctly resolving anaphors. If one treats all discourse units in the preceding discourse equally, the increase is statistically significant only when a discourse-based corefererice system looks back at most four discourse units in order to establish co-referenfial links. However, if one assumes that proximity plays an important role in establishing co-referential links and that referential expressions are more likely to be linked to referees that were used recently in discourse, the increase is statistically significant no matter how many units a discourse-based co-reference system looks back in order toestablish co-referenfial links.
