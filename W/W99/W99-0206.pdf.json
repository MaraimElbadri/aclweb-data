Unlike conventional work which was semantic markers for semantic constraints, we used examples for semantic constraints and showed in our experiments that examples are as useful as semantic markers. We also propose many new methods for estimating referents of'pronouns. For example, we use the form \"X of Y\" for estimating referents of demonstrative adjectives. In addition to our new methods, we used many conventional methods. As a result, experiments using these methods obtained a precision rate of 87% in estimating referents of demonstrative pronouns, personal pronouns, and zero pronouns for training sentences, and obtained a precision rate of 78% for test sentences."]},{"title":"1 Overview","paragraphs":["This paper describes how to resolve the referents of pronouns: demonstrative pronouns, personal pronouns, and zero pronouns. Pronoun resolution is especially important for machine translation. For example, if the system cannot resolve zero pronouns 1, it cannot translate sentences containing them from Japanese into English. When the word order of sentences is changed and the pronominalized words are changed in translation into English, the system must detect the referents of the pronouns.","A lot of work has been done in Japanese pronoun resolution (Kameyama 86) (Yamamuraet al. 92) (Walker et al. 94) (Takada & Doi 94) (Nakaiwa & Ikehara 95).

The antecedents of pronouns are determined by heuristic rules from left to right. Using these rules, our system assigns points to possible antecedents, and judges that the one having the maximum total score is the desired antecedent.","Heuristic rules are classified into two kinds: Candidate enumerating rules and Candidate judging rules. Candidate enumerating rules are used in enumerating candidate antecedents and giving them points (which represent the plausibility of being the correct antecedent). Candidate judging rules are used in giving points to the candidate antecedents selected by Candidate enumerating rules. These rules are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Surface expressions, semantic constraints, referential properties, etc. are written as conditions in the Condition part. Possible antecedents are written in the Possible-Antecedent part. Points means the plausibility of the possible antecedent.","An estimation of the referent is performed using the total scores of possible antecedents given by Candidate enumerating rules and Candidate judging rules. First, the system applies all Candidate enumerating rules to the anaphor and enumerates candidate antecedents having points. Next, the system applies aLl Candidate judging rules to all the candidate antecedents and sums the scores of all the candidate antecedents.

The errors made by the structure analyzer were corrected by hand. We used IPAL dictionary (IPAL 87) as a verb case frame dictionary. We put together the case frames of the verb phrases which were not contained in this dictionary by consulting a large amount of linguistic data.","An example of resolving the demonstrative \"kono (this)\" is shown in Figure 4, which shows that the referent of the noun phrase \"kono dorudaka (this dollar's surge)\" was properly judged to be the previous sentence.","By Candidate enumerating rule 2 in Section 3, the system took a candidate \"the previous sentence\" and gave it 15 points. By Candidate enumerating rule 5 in Section 3, the system took a candidate \"new individual\" and gave it 10 points. By Candidate enumerating rulel in Section 3, the system took three candidates, \"130 yen (130 yen)\", \"kitai (expectations)\", and \"dorusouba (dollar)\", and gave them 17, 15, and 15 points, respectively. The system applied Candidate judging rule 6 to them. This uses examples of \"X no Y\". In this case, it used examples of \"X no dorudaka (the dollar's surge of X)\". The only example noun phrase X of this form \"X no dorudaka\" in the EDR occurrence dictionary was \"saikin (recently)\". All three candidates, \"130 yea (130 yen)\", \"kitai (expectations)\", and \"dorusouba (dollar)\", were low in similarity to \"saikin (recently)\" in \"Bun Rui Goihyou\", and were given -30 points by Table 8. Two candidates, \"the previous sentence\" and \"new individual', so they are not noun phrases, and were not given points by Candidate judging rule 6. As a result, \"the previous sentence\" had the highest score and was judged to be the proper referent.","We show the results of our resolution of demonstratives, personal pronouns, and zero pronouns in Table 11. The detailed results for demonstratives are shown in Table 12. The precision rate of zero pronouns is in the case when the system knows whether the zero pronoun has a referent or not in advance. 6.2 Discussion With respect to demonstratives, the precision rate was over 80% even in the test sentences. This indicates that the rules used in this system are effective. But since Japanese demonstratives are classified into many kinds, the precision may be increased by making more detailed rules. In this work we used the feature that \"kono (this)\" rarely functions as a daikou-reference. There were four cases analyzed correctly because of this rule.","With respect to personal pronouns, since only first and second personal pronouns appeared in the texts used in the experiment, almost all of the personal pronouns were resolved correctly by estimating the first and second persons in the quotation. The main reason for the errors in the personal pronoun resolution is that the n/-case zero pronoun was resolved incorrectly and the second person was estimated incorrectly."]},{"title":"45","paragraphs":["Text Tr~ning Test","Table 12: Detailed results for demonstrative demonstrative demonstrative demonstrative","pronoun adjective adverb 83% (15/18) 86% (19/22) 100% (7/7) 82% (14/17) 88% (23/26) 83% (5/6) total score 87% (41/47) 86% (42/49)"]},{"title":"Table 13: Results of com","paragraphs":["Method 1","Demonstrative 87% (41/47) 86% (42/49)","Personal pronoun 100% (9/ 9) 82% (9/11)","Zero pronoun 86%(177]205) 76%(159/208)"]},{"title":")arison between semantic marker and example-base","paragraphs":["Method 2 Method 3 83% (39/47) 87% (41/47) 88°£ (43/49) 88% (43/49) 100% (9/ 9) 100% (9/ 9) 64% (7/11) 82% (9/11) 83%(171/205) 86%(176/205) 76%(158/208) 79%(164/208)","Method 4 83% (39/47) 84% (41/49)"]},{"title":"100% (9/ 9) 55% (6/11)","paragraphs":["82%(169/205) 75%(155/208) Method 5"]},{"title":"79% (3r/4r)","paragraphs":["86% (42/49)"]},{"title":"89% (8/9) 64% (r/11)","paragraphs":["66%(135/205) 63°£(131/208) Method 1 : Using both semantic marker and example Method 2 : Using semantic marker Method 3 : Using example (using modified codes of bnnrui goi hyou) Method 4 : Using example (using original codes of bunrui goi hyou) Method 5 : Using neither semantic marker nor example","There are several reasons for the errors of the zero pronoun resolution: there are errors in Japanese thesaurus \"Bunrui goi hyou\", Noun Semantic Marker Dictionary, and Case Frame Dictionary. 6.3 Comparison Experiment As mentioned before, we use both the example rule and the semantic marker rule as judging rules. To check which rule is more effective, we made a comparison between the example method and the semantic marker method. The results are shown in Table 13. The upper and lower rows of this table show the accuracy rates for training and test sentences, respectively. The precision of the method using examples was equivalent or superior to that of the method using semantic markers, as shown in Table 13. This indicates that we can use examples as well as semantic markers. Since some codes in BGH are incorrect, we modified them. Since the precision using modified codes was higher than that using original codes, this indicates that the code modification is valid. 7 Summary In this paper, we presented a method of estimating referents of demonstrative pronouns, personal pronouns, and Zero pronouns in Japanese sentences using examples, surface expressions, topics and foci. Unlike conventional works, which use semantic markers for semantic constraints, we use examples for semantic constraints and showed in our experiments that examples are as useful as semantic markers. We also proposed many new methods for estimating referents of pronouns. For example, we used the form \"X of Y\" for estimating referents of demonstrative adjectives. In addition to our new methods, we used many conventional methods. As a result, experiments using these methods obtained a precision rate of 87~0 in estimating referents of demonstrative pronouns, personal pronouns, and zero pronouns for training sentences, and obtained a precision rate of 78% for test sentences."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Electronic Dictionary Research Institute, ltd.: Electronic Dictionary, Japanese Word Dictionary, Version 1.5, (in Japanese), 1995.
