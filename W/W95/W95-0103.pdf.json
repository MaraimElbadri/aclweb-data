Typically, ambiguous verb phrases of the form v rip1 p rip2 are resolved through a model which considers values of the four head words (v, nl, p and 77,2). This paper shows that the problem is analogous to n-gram language models in speech recognition, and that one of the most common methods for language modeling, the backed-off estimate, is applicable. Results on Wall Street Journal data of 84.5% accuracy are obtained using this method. A surprising result is the importance of low-count events - ignoring events which occur less than 5 times in training data reduces performance to 81.6%."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Prepositional phrase attachment is a common cause of structural ambiguity in natural language. For example take the following sentence: Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, joined the board as a nonexecutive director. The PP 'as a nonexecutive director' can either attach to the NP 'the board' or to the VP 'joined', giving two alternative structures. (In this case the VP attachment is correct): NP-attach: (joined ((the board) (as a nonexecutive director))) VP-attach: ((joined (the board)) (as a nonexecutive director)) Work by Ratnaparkhi, Reynar and Roukos [RRR94] and Brill and Resnik [BR94] has considered corpus-based approaches to this problem, using a set of examples to train a model which is then used to make attachment decisions on test data. Both papers describe methods which look at the four head words involved in the attachment - the VP head, the first NP head, the preposition and the second NP head (in this case joined, board, as and director respectively). This paper proposes a new statistical method for PP-attachment disambiguation based on the four head words. 2\"7"]},{"title":"2 Background","paragraphs":["2.1 Training and Test Data The training and test data were supplied by IBM, being identical to that used in [RRR94]. Examples of verb phrases eontMning a (v np pp) sequence had been taken fl'om the Wall Street Journal Treebank [MSM93]. For each such VP the head verb, first head noun, preposition and second head noun were extracted, along with the attachment decision (1 for noun attachment, 0 for verb). For example the verb phrase: ((joined (the board)) (as a nonexecutive director)) would give the quintuple: 0 joined board as director The elements of this quintuple will from here on be referred to as the random variables A, V, N1, P, and N2. In the above verb phrase A = 0, V = joined, N1 = board, P = as, and N2 = director. The data consisted of training and test files of 20801 and 3097 quintuples respectively. In addition, a development set of 4039 quintuples was also supplied. This set was used during development of the attachment algorithm, ensuring that there was no implicit training of the method on the test set itself. 2.2 Outline of the Problem A PP-attachment algorithm must take each quadruple (V = v, N1 = nl, P = p, N2 = n2) in test data and decide whether the attachment variable A = 0 or 1. The accuracy of the algorithm is then the percentage of attachments it gets 'correct' on test data, using the A values taken from the treebank as the reference set. The probability of the attachment variable A being 1 or 0 (signifying noun or verb attachment respectively) is a probability, p, which is conditional on the values of the words in the quadruple. In general a probabilistic algorithm will make an estimate, 15, of this probability: 15(A= llV=v, Nl=nl, P=p, N2=n2) For brevity this estimate will be referred to from here on as: p(l[v, nl,p, n2) 28 The decision can then be made using the test:"]},{"title":"~(llv, nl,p, n2 )","paragraphs":[">= 0.5 If this is true the attachment is made to the noun, !f not then it is made to the verb. 2.3 Lower and Upper Bounds on Performance When evaluating an algorithm it is useful to have an idea of the lower and upper bounds on its performance. Some key results are summarised in the table below. All results in this section are on the IBM training and test data, with the exception of the two 'average human' results.

The human performance results are taken from [RRR94], and are the average performance of 3 treebanking experts on a set of 300 randomly selected test events from the WSJ corpus, first looking at the four head words alone, then using the whole sentence. A reasonable lower bound seems to be 72.2% as scored by the 'Most likely for each preposition' method. An approximate upper bound is 88.2% - it seems unreasonable to expect an algorithm to perform much better than a human."]},{"title":"3 Estimation based on Training Data Counts","paragraphs":["3.1"]},{"title":"Notation","paragraphs":["We will use the symbol f to denote the number of times a particular tuple is seen in training data.

Note that it is difficult to compare this result to results on Wall Street Journal, as the two corpora may be quite different. The Wall Street Journal Treebank [MSM93] enabled both [RRR94] and [BR94] to extract a large amount of supervised training material for the problem. Both of these methods consider the second noun, n2, as well as v, nl and p, with the hope that this additional information will improve results. [BR94] use 12,000 training and 500 test examples.

They use a maximum entropy model which also considers subsets of the quadruple. Each sub-tuple predicts noun or verb attachment with a weight indicating its strength of prediction - the weights are trained to maximise the likelihood of training data. For example (P = of) might have a strong weight for noun attachment, while (V = buy, P = for) would have a strong weight for verb attachment. [RRR94] also allow the model to look a.t class inlbrmation, this time the classes were learned automatically from a corpus. Results of 77.7% (words only) and 81.6% (words and classes) are reported. Crucially they ignore low-count events in training data by imposing a frequency cut-off somewhere between 3 and 5."]},{"title":"4 The Backed-Off Estimate","paragraphs":["[KATZ87] describes backed-off n-gram word models for speech recognition.

An experiment was made with all counts less than 5 being put to zero, 6 effectively making the algorithm ignore low count events. In [RRR94] a cut-off 'between 3 and 5' is used for all events.
