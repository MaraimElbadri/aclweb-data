The first tests for the presence of particular context words within a certain distance of the ambiguous target word. The second tests for collocations -- patterns of words and part-of-speech tags around the target word. The context-word and collocation methods have complementary coverage: the former captures the lexical \"atmosphere\" (discourse topic, tense, etc.), while the latter captures local syntax. Yarowsky [1994] has exploited this complementarity by combining the two methods using decision lists. The idea is to pool the evidence provided by the component methods, and to then solve a target problem by applying the single strongest piece of evidence, whatever type it happens to be. Yarowsky applied his method to the task of restoring missing accents in Spanish and French, and found that it outperformed both the method based on context words, and one based on local syntax. This paper takes Yarowsky's method as a starting point, and hypothesizes that further improvements can be obtained by taking into account not only the single strongest piece of evidence, but all the available evidence. A method is presented for doing this, based on Bayesian classifiers.","The work reported here was applied not to accent restoration, but to a related lexical disambiguation task: context-sensitive spelling correction. The task is to fix spelling errors that happen to result in valid words in the lexicon; for example: I'd like the chocolate cake for ,desert. where dessert was misspelled as desert. This goes beyond the capabilities of conventional spell checkers, which can only detect errors that result in non-words. 39","We start by applying a very simple method to the task, to serve as a baseline for comparison with the other methods. We then al)ply each of the two component methods mentioned above -- context words and collocations. We try two ways of combining these components: decision lists, and Bayesian classifiers. We evaluate the above methods by comparing them with an alternative approach to spelling correction based on part-of-speech trigrams.","The sections below discuss the task of context-sensitive spelling correction, the five methods we tried for the task (baseline, two component methods, and two hybrid methods), and the evaluation. The final section draws some conclusions."]},{"title":"2 Context-sensitive spelling correction","paragraphs":["Context-sensitive spelling correction is the problem of correcting spelling errors that result in valid words in the lexicon.

There are several ways to obtain such a collection. One is based on finding words in the dictionary that are one typo away from each other [Mays"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1991]. 1 Another finds words that have the same or similar pronunciations. Since this was not the focus of the work reported here, we simply took (most of) our confusion sets fl'om the list of \"Words Commonly Confused\" in the back of the Random House unabridged dictionary [Flexner, 1983].","A final point concerns the two types of errors a spelling-correction program can make: false negatives (complaining about a correct word), and false positives (failing to notice an error). We will make the simplifying assumption that both kinds of errors are equally bad. In practice, however, false negatives are much worse, as users get irritated by programs that badger them with bogus complaints. However, given the probabilistic nature of the methods that will be presented below, it would not be hard to modify them to take this into account. We would merely set a confidence threshold, and report a suggested correction only if the probability of the suggested word exceeds the probability of the user's original spelling by at least the threshold amount. The reason this was not done in the work reported here is that setting this confidence threshold involves a certain subjective factor (which depends on the user's \"irritability threshold\"). Our simpli~,ing assumption allows us to measure performance objectively, by the single parameter of prediction accuracy.","1Constructing confllsion sets in this way requires assigning each word in the lexicon its own confusion set.

Each method will be described in terms of its operation on a single confusion set C = (Wl,..., w~}; that is, we will say how the method disambiguates occurrences of words wl through wn from the context. The methods handle multiple confusion sets by applying the same technique to each confusion set independently.","Each method involves a training phase and a test phase. The performance figures given below are based on training each method on the 1-million-word Brown corpus [Ku~:era and Francis, 1967] and testing it on a 3/4-million-word corpus of Wall Street Journal text [Marcus et al., 1993]. 3.1 Baseline method The baseline method disambiguates words wl through wn by simply ignoring the context, and always guessing that the word should be whichever wi occurred most often in the training corpus. For instance, if C -- (desert, dessert}, and desert occurred more often than dessert in the training corpus, then the method will predict that every occurrence of desert or dessert in the test corpus should be changed to (dr left as) desert.","Table 1 shows the performance of the baseline method for 18 confusion sets. This collection of confusion sets will be used for evaluating the methods throughout the paper. Each line of the table gives the results for one confusion set: the words in the confusion set; the number of instances of any word in the confusion set in the training corpus and in the test corpus; the word in the confusion set that occurred most often in the training corpus; and the prediction accuracy of the baseline method for the test corpus. Prediction accuracy is the number of times the correct word was predicted, divided by the total number of test cases. For example, the members of the confusion set {I, me} occurred 840 times in the test corpus, the breakdown being 744 I and 96 me. The baseline method predicted I every time, a.nd thus was right 744 times, for a score of 744/840 = 0.886.","Essentially the baseline method measures how accurately one can predict words using just their prior probabilities. This provides a lower bound on the performance we would expect from the other methods, which use more than just the priors. 3.2 Component method 1: Context words One clue about the identity of an ambiguous target word comes from the words around it. For instance, if the target word is ambiguous between desert and dessert, and we see words like arid, sand, and sun nearby, this suggests that the target word should be desert. On the other hand, words such as chocolate and delicious ill the context imply dessert. This observation is the basis for the method of context words. The idea is that each word wi in the confusion set will have a characteristic distribution of words that occur in its context; thus to classify an ambiguous target word, we look at the set of words around it and see which wi's distribution they most closely follow. 41","Confusion set No. of training","cases","No. of","test","cases whether, weather 331 245 I, me 6125 840 its, it's 1951 3575 past, passed 385 397 than, then 2949 1659 being, begin 727 449 effect, affect 228 162 your, you're 1047 212 number, amount 588 429 council, counsel 82 83 rise, raise 139 301 between, among 1003 730 led, lead 226 219 except, accept 232 95 peace, piece 310 61 there, their, they're 5026 2187 principle, principal 184 69 sight, site, cite 149 44 Most frequent word Baseline whether 0.922 I 0.886 its 0.863 past 0.861 than 0.807 being 0.780 effect 0.741 your 0.726 number 0.627 council 0.614 rise 0.575 between 0.538 led 0.530 except 0.442 peace 0.393 there 0.306 principle 0.290 sight 0.114 Table 1: Performance of the baseline method for 18 confusion sets.

(In subsequent tables, confusion sets will be referred to by their most frequent word.) The \"Baseline\" column gives the prediction a,ccuracy of the baseline system on the test corpus.","Following previous work [Gale et al., 1994], we formulate tile method in a Bayesian framework.

By ignoring such words, we eliminate a source of noise in our discrimination procedure, as well as reducing storage requirements and run time. To determine whether a context word e is a useful discriminator, we run a chi-squa.re test [Fleiss, 1981] to check for an association between the presence of c and the choice of word in the confusion set. If the observed association is not judged to be significant, a then c is discarded. The significance level is currently set to 0.05.","Figure 1 pulls together the points of the preceding discussion into an outline of the method of context words. In the training phase, it identifies a list of context words that are useful for discriminating among the words in the confusion set. At run time, it estimates the probability of each word in the confusion set. It starts with the prior probabilities, and multiplies them by the likelihood of each context word fl'om its list that appears in the Â±k-word window of the target word. Finally, it selects the word in the confusion set with the greatest probability.","The main parameter to tune for the method of context words is k, the half-width of the context window. Previous work [Yarowsky, 1994] shows that smaller values of k (3 or 4) work well for resolving local syntactic ambiguities, while larger values (20 to 50) are suitable for resolving semantic ambiguities. We tried the values 3, 6, 12, and 24 on some practice confusion sets (not shown here), and found that k = 3 generally did best, indicating that most of the action, for our task and confusion sets, comes fl'om local syntax. In the rest of this paper, this value of k will be used.","=We are interpreting the condition \"cj occurs within a =l=k-word window of wi\" as a binary feature -- either it happens, or it does not. This allows us to handle context words in the same Bayesian framework as will be used later for other binary features (see Section 3.3). A more conventional interpretation is to take into account the number of occurrences of each cj within the ::l=k-word window, and to estimate p(cjlwi ) accordingly. However, either interpretation is valid, as long as it is applied consistently -- that is, both when estimating the likelihoods from training data, and when classifying test. cases.","3An association is significant if the probability that it occurred by chance is low. This is not a statement about the strength of the association. Even a weak association may be judged significant if there are enough data to support it. Measures of the strength of association will be discussed in Section 3.4. 43 Training phase (1) Propose all words as candidate context words. (2) Count occurrences of each candidate context word in the training corpus. (3) Prune context words that have insufficient data or are uninformative discriminators. (4) Store the remaining context words (and their associated statistics) for use at run time. Run time (1) Initialize the probability for each word in the confusion set to its prior probability. (2) Go through the list of context words that was saved during training. For each context word","that appears in the context of the ambiguous target word, update the probabilities. (3) Choose the word in the confusion set with the highest probability. Figure 1: Outline of the method of context words.","Table 2 shows the effect of varying k for our usual collection of confusion sets. It can be seen that performance generally degrades as k increases. The reason is that the method starts picking up spurious correlations in the training corpus. Table 4 gives some examples of the context words learned for the confusion set {peace, piece}, with k = 24. The context words coTTs, united, nations, etc., all imply peace, and appear to be plausible (although united and nations are a counterexample to our earlier assumption of independence). On the other hand, consider the context word how, which allegedly also implies peace. If we look back at the training corpus for the supporting data for this word, we find excerpts such as:","But oh, how I do sometimes need just a moment of rest, and peace ...","No matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace ... How best to destroy your peace ? There does not seem to be a necessary connection here between how and peace; the correlation is probably spurious. Although we are using a chi-square test expressly to filter out such spurious correlations, we can only expect the test to catch 95% of them (given that the significance level was set to 0.05). As mentioned above, most of the legitimate context words show up for small k; thus as k gets large, the limited number of legitimate context words gets overwhelmed by the 5% of the spurious correlations that make it through our filter. 3.3 Component method 2: Collocations The method of context words is good at capturing generalities that depend on the presence of nearby words, but not their order. When order matters, other more syntax-based methods, such as collocations and trigrams, are appropriate. In the work reported here, the method of collocations was used to capture order dependencies. A collocation expresses a pattern of syntactic elements around the target word. We allow two types of syntactic elements: words, and part-of-speech tags. Going back to the {desert, dessert} example, a collocation that would imply desert might be: PREP the 44 Confusion set whether I its past than being effect your number council ri se between led except peace there principle sight Baseline 0.922 0.886 0.863 0.861 0.807 0.780 0.741 0.726 0.627 0.614 0.575 0.538 0.530 0.442 0.393 0.306 0.290 0.114","Avg no. of context words","Cwords Cwords Cwords Cwords :1=3 =t=6 =i:12 =t=24 0.902 0.922 0.927 0.922 0.914 0.893 0.883 0.851 0.862 0.795 0.743 0.702 0.861 0.849 0.801 0.743 0.931 0.901 0.896 0.855 0.791 0.795 0.793 0.755 0.747 0.741 0.759 0.716 0.816 0.783 0.774 0.736 0.646 0.622 0.636 0.639 0.639 . 0.614 0.602 0.614 0.575 0.575 0.585 0.498 0.759 0.697 0.671 0.586 0.530 0.530 0.521 0.557 0.695 0.526 0.516 0.558 0.754 0.705 0.574 0.574 0.726 0.623 0.557 0.466 0.290 0.290 0.290 0.435 0.455 0.250 0.364 0.318 27.9 36.9 55.9 92.9 Table 2: Performance of the method of context words as a function of k, the half-width of the context window. The bottom line of the table shows the number of context words learned, averaged over all confusion sets, also as a function of k. This collocation would match the sentences: Travelers entering from the desert were confounded...","... along with some guerrilla fighting in the desert.","...two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert ... Matching part-of-speech tags (here, PREP) against the sentence is done by first tagging each word in the sentence with its set of possible part-of-speech tags, obtained from a dictionary. For instance, walk has the tag set {NS, V}, corresponding to its use as a singular noun and as a verb. 4 For a tag to match a word, the tag must be a member of the word's tag set. The reason we use tag sets, instead of running a tagger on the sentence to produce unique tags, is that taggers need to look at all words in the sentence, which is impossible when the target word is taken to be ambiguous (but see the trigram method in Section 4).","The method of collocations was implemented in much the same way as the method of context words. The idea. is to discriminate among the words wi in the confusion set by identifying the collocations that tend to occur around each wi. An ambiguous target word is then classified by finding all collocations that match its context. Each collocation provides some degree of evidence","4Our tag inventory contains 40 tags, and includes the usual categories for determiners, nouns, verbs, modals, etc., a few specialized tags (for be, have, and do), and a dozen compound tags (such as V+PRO for let's). 45 for each word in the confusion set.

Note, incidentally, that there can be at most two non-conflicting collocations for any decision -- one matching on the left-hand side of the target word, and one on the right.","Having said that we resolve conflicts between two collocations by eliminating one of them, we still need to specify which one.

The method is described in terms of \"features\" rather than \"collocations\" to reflect its full generality; the features could be context words as well a.s collocations. In fact, the method subsumes the method of context words -- it does everything that method does, and resolves conflicts among its features as well. To facilitate the conflict resolution, it sorts the features by decreasing strength.","Like the method of context words, the method of collocations has one main parameter to tune: e, the maximum number of syntactic elements in a collocation. Since the number of collocations grows exponentially with e, it was only practical to vary g from 1 to 3. We tried this on some practice confusion sets, and found that all values of g gave roughly comparable performance. We selected g = 2 to use from here on, as a compromise between reducing the expressive power of collocations (with g = 1) and incurring a high computational cost (with g = 3).","Table 3 shows the results of varying f for the usual confusion sets.

We looked at a method based on part-of-speech trigrams, developed and implemented by Schabes [1995].","Schabes's method can be viewed as performing an abductive inference: given a sentence containing an ambiguous word, it asks which choice wi for that word would best explain the observed sequence of words in the sentence. It answers this question by substituting each wi in turn into the sentence. The wi that produces the highest-probability sentence is selected. Sentence probabilities are calculated using a part-of-speech trigram model.","We tried Schabes's method on the usual confusion sets; the results are in the last column of Table 7. It can be seen that trigrams and the Bayesian hybrid method each have their better moments. Trigrams are at their worst when the words in the confusion set have the same part of speech. In this case, trigrams can distinguish between the words only by their prior probabilities -- this follows from the way the method calculates sentence probabilities. Thus, for {between, among}, for example, where both words are prepositions, trigrams score the same as the baseline method. In such cases, the Bayesian hybrid method is clearly better. On the other hand, when the words in the confusion set have different parts of speech -- as in, for example, {there, their, they%e} -- trigrams are often better than the Bayesian method. We believe this is because trigrams look not just at a few words on either side of the target word, but at the part-of-speech sequence of the whole sentence. This analysis indicates a complementarity between trigrams and Bayes, and suggests a 52 combination ill which trigrams would be applied first, but if trigrams determine that the words in the confusion set have the same part of speech for the sentence at issue, then the sentence would be passed to the Bayesian method. This is a research direction we plan to pursue."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["The work reported here builds on Yarowsky's use of decision lists to combine two component methods -- context words and collocations. Decision lists pool the evidence fl'om the two methods, and solve a target problem by applying the single strongest piece of evidence, whichever type that happens to be. This paper investigated the hypothesis that even better performance can be obtained by basing decisions on not just the single strongest piece of evidence, but on M1 available evidence. A method for doing this, based on Bayesian classifiers, was presented. It was applied to the task of context-sensitive spelling correction, and was found to outperform the component methods as well as decision lists. A comparison of the Bayesian hybrid method with Schabes's trigram-based method suggested a further combination in which trigrams would be used when the words in the confusion set had different parts of speech, and the Bayesian method would be used otherwise. This is a direction we plan to pursue in future research."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Bill Freeman, Yves Schabes, Emmanuel Roche, and Jacki Golding for helpful and enjoyable discussions on the work reported here."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Joseph L.
