The form of a model","1Although these are always involved in developing probabilistic classifiers, they may not be broken out into three separate steps in a particular method; an example is decision tree induction (14). 101 specifies the stochastic relationships, the interdependencies, that exist among the variables. The parameters define the distributions of the sets of interdependent variables, i.e., the probabilities of the various combinations of the values of the interdependent variables. As an illustration, consider the following three parametric forms, each specifying different sets of interdependencies among variables in describing the joint distribution of a classification variable, Tag, and a set of non-classification variables, F1 through Fn. In the equations below, tag represents the value of the classification variable and the fi's denote the values of the non-classification variables.","The model for interdependence among all variables:","V tag, fl, f2,..., fn P(tag, fl, f2 .... , fn) = P(tag, fl,f2,...,fn) (1)","The model for conditional independence among all non-classification variables given the value of the classification variable:","V tag, fl,f2,...,fn P(tag, fl,f2 .... ,fn) = P(flltag) x ... x P(fnltag) x P(tag) (2)","The model for independence among all variables:","V tag, fl,f~,...,fn P(tag,fl,f2,...,fn) = P(tag) x P(fl) x P(f2) x ... x P(fn) (3) The objective in defining the parametric form of a model is to describe the relationships among all variables in terms of only the most important interdependencies. While it is always true that all variables can be treated as interdependent (equation 1), if there are several features, such a model could have too many parameters to estimate in practice. The greater the number of interdependeneies expressed in a model the more complex the model is said to be.","3. Estimation of the model parameters from the training data. While the form of a model identifies the relationships among the variables, the parameters express the uncertainty in-herent in those relationships. Recall that the parameters of a model describe the distributions of the sets of interdependent variables by defining the likelihood of seeing each combination of the values of those variables. For example, the parameters of the model for independence are the following:","V tag, fl,f~,...,fr, : P(tag), P(fl), P(f2) .... , P(f,~) There are no interdependencies in the model for independence, so the parameters describe the distributions of the individual variables. 102","In the model for conditional independence stated in equation 2, the parameters are as follows:","V tag, fl,f2,...,fn : P(flltag) .... , P(fnltag), P(tag) Each parameter in this model describes the distribution of the tag in combination with a single contextual feature.","The parameters of any model are eslima~ed if their values are based on functions of a data sample (i.e., statistics) as opposed to properties of the population.","4.

We describe measures that can be used to evaluate the effect of each of these three steps on classifier performance. Using these measures, we demonstrate that it is possible to analyze the contribution of each step as well as the interdependencies that exist between these steps.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The first section is a description of the experimental setup used for the investigations performed in this paper. Next, the evaluation measures that we propose are presented, followed by a discussion of the results and finally a presentation of our conclusions.","2When the values of all non-classification variables are known and there are no interdependent ambiguities among the classes. I The Experimental Setup In this paper, we analyze the performance of classifters developed for the disambiguation of twelve different words. For each of these words, we develop a range of classifiers based on models of varying complexity. Our purpose is to study the contribution that each of feature selection, selection of the form of a model, and parameter estimation makes to overall model performance. In this section, we describe the basic experimental setup used in these evaluations, in particular, the protocol used in the disambiguation experiments and the procedure used to formulate each model. Protocol for the Disambiguation Experiments There are three parameters that define a word-sense disambiguation experiment: (1)the choice of words and word meanings (their number and type), (2) the method used to identify the \"correct\" word meaning, and (3) the choice of text from which the data is taken. In these experiments, the complete set of non-idiomatic senses defined in the Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (13) is used as the tag set for each word to be disambiguated. For each use of a targeted word, the best tag, from among the set of LDOCE sense tags, is determined by a human judge. The tag assigned by the classifier is accepted as correct only when it is identical to the tag pre-selected by the human judge.","All data used in these experiments are taken from the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus (10). This corpus was selected because of its availability and size. Further, the POS categories assigned in the Penn 'IYeebank corpus are used to resolve syntactic ambiguity so that word-meaning disambiguation occurs only after the syntactic category of a word has been identified.","The following words were selected for disambiguation based on their relatively high frequency of occurrence and the appropriateness of their sense distinctions for the textual domain. * Nouns: interest, bill, concern, and drug. Â• Verbs: close, help, agree, and include. Â• Adjectives: chief, public, last, and common. Because word senses from a particular dictionary are used, the degree of ambiguity for each word is fixed, and the overall level of ambiguity addressed by the experiment is determined by this selection of words. For each of these words, the sense tags and their distributions in the data are presented in Tables 1 through 3."]},{"title":"103","paragraphs":["Noun senses of interest: (total count: 2368) 1 \"readiness to give attention\": 15% 2 \"quality of causing attention to","be given\" : <1~ 3 \"activity, subject, etc., which one","gives time and attention to\": 3~ 4 \"advantage, advancement, or favor\": 8~ 5 \"a share in a company, business, etc.\": 21~ 6 \"money paid for the use of money\" : 53Â°~ Noun senses of concern: (total count: 1488) 1 \"a matter that is of interest or","importance\": 3~ 2 \"serious care or interest\": 2~ 3 \"worry; anxiety\": 32~ 4 \"a business; firm\" : 64~ Noun senses of bill: (total count: 1335) 1 \"a plan for a law, written down for","the government to consider\": 69~ 2 \"a list of things bought and their","price\": 10g 4 \"a piece of paper money\" (extended","to include treasury bills): 21~ Noun senses of drug: (total count: 1217) 1 \"a medicine or material used for","making medicines\": 58~ 2 \"a habit-forming substance\": 42~ Table 1: Data summary- Nouns. Feature Selection For simplicity, the contextual features used in all models were selected per the following schema.

While collocation-specific variables are, by definition, specific to the word being disambiguated, the procedure used to select them is general. The search for collocation-specific variables is limited to the 400 most frequent spelling forms in a data sample composed of sentences containing the ambiguous word. Out of those 400, the three spelling forms whose presence was found to be the most dependent on the value of the classification variable, using the test for independence described in (12), were selected as the collocational variables for that word. 104 Formulation of a Range of Parametric Forms To support these experiments, for each word, a range of models of varying complexity were formulated, with each model defining a new classifier. To distinguish among these models, we introduce a measure of model complexity: the total number of pairwise interdependencies that are specified in the model. For each word, the model of maximal complexity is the model in which all variables are considered to be interdependent (equation 1). The model of minimal complexity formulated for each word is the model in which all non-classification variables are considered to be conditionally independent given the value of the classification variable (equation 2); this is the simplest model that still uses each non-classification variable in predicting the value of the classification variable.","The formulation of these models is conducted as a series of stepwise refinements, starting with the model of maximal complexity. At each step, a new model is formulated from the current model as follows (initially the current model is the starting model). Each of the pairwise interdependencies in the current model is evaluated, using a goodness-of-fit test. The test used is an exact test (12) for evaluating the interdependency between two variables, where two variables are interdependent if they are not conditionally (or fully) independent. The test determines the degree to which that interdependency is manifested in the training data. The new (less complex) model formulated is the current model with the interdependency that is least apparent in the training data removed. The new model is used to classify the test data and then serves as the current model in the next simplification step. A more complete description of this procedure can be found in (2). Parameter Estimation In these experiments, we use"]},{"title":"maximum-likelihood estimates (M.Â£. estimates)","paragraphs":["of the model parameters. The theoretical motivation behind this approach is intuitively appealing: the model parameters are represented by the numerical values that maximize the probability of generating the training data from a model of the specified form. The implementation is straightforward. For each set of interdependent variables in the model, the associated parameters are the probabilities of the combinations of the values of those variables. The estimates of those parameters are equal to the relative frequencies with which those combinations occur in the training data. The drawback is that the estimates of parameters corresponding to events that occur infrequently in the training data are not reliable; for example, if an event is not observed in the training data, then the estimated probability of that event is zero. Description of Evaluation Measures This paper describes measures that can be used to examine the appropriateness, for the test set, of the features used in a model, the parametric form of the model, and the parameter estimates. Figures 1-12 plot model complexity against a number of model performance measures. The gaps between the overall classification performance of a model (indicated as \"Overall Model\" in the figures) and the other measures is variously due to error introduced by the three factors under study.

In this case, the performance of the full model is necessarily 100%.","If the performance is not 100%, since the model describes the exact joint distribution, the degraded performance can only be due to the lack of complete discriminatory power of the features-- i.e., there are combinations of feature values with which more than one tag occurs.

For each word, we formulate a range of models of varying complexity. The model of maximal complexity is the model in which all variables are considered to be interdependent (equation 1). The model of minimal complexity that is formulated is the model in which all non-classification variables are considered to be conditionally independent given the value of the classification variable (equation 2).","For each word to be disambiguated there is a figure depicting the various measures of model performance as a function of model complexity, where model complexity ranges from the maximal to the minimal model.","Our purpose is to study the effect that each of the three facets of model formulation has on model performance. By evaluating each facet independently we can gauge the impact that each has on the overall performance of a classifier. This is important for many reasons, but here our primary concern is understanding the limitations of model performance.","Using the measures described previously, we are able to demonstrate four main points regard-ing model formulation. Note that all measures used in establishing these claims are applied with respect to some specific test set and therefore the results are dependent on the characteristics of the particular test set being used. The feature set fixes the upper bound of model performance. As discussed in item 6, if the feature set is ideal for the test set, then each context will uniquely correspond to a single tag. In other words, the feature set is an infallible indicator of the correct tag. When this is not the case (i.e., there are contexts in which two or more tags occur), then all but the most frequently occurring tag (for that context) will be misclassified, and there is nothing that can be changed with regards to the parametric form or the parameter estimates to remedy this situa-tion. Therefore the feature set establishes the upper bound of model performance. This is demonstrated in Figures 1 through 12. It is interesting to note that for four of the words (\"bill\", \"chief\", \"include\", and \"concern\") the feature set was optimal for the test set (i.e., the measure of feature-set was 100%). Even in the worst case, the error introduced by the lack of discriminatory power of the feature set did not exceed 8%. Note that when the feature set is not optimal, the resulting error affects the precision of the model. This can be observed by comparing the gap between recall and overall model performance (the misclassification error, equivalent to 1 -precision) for models with relatively large feature-related error (such as the models for \"public\") to that of models in which the features are optimal, such as those for \"bill\" and \"include\". When the feature set is optimal, it contributes nothing to misclassification error. When this is the case, misclassification error is strictly a function of the appropriateness of the parametric form and the parameter estimates. We consider measures of these contributions next. As the complexity of the model"]},{"title":"is","paragraphs":["reduced, important information is lost from the parametric form. The measure of the appropriateness of the parametric form (the measure of form) is included in the performance measures plotted in Figures 1 through 12. When the model is maximally complex, this measure indicates the quality of the feature set, as discussed above. As soon as the complexity of the model is reduced, the model form is no longer an exact expression of the distribution apparent in the test set; assumptions of conditional independence have been introduced into the model. The process used to reduce model complexity assures that each time an assumption of conditional independence is made (i.e., an interdependency between two variables is removed), it is, at least in a local sense, the most appropriate one to have selected based on an analysis of the training data. In Figures 1 through 12 we see that, up to a point, judicious selection of the conditional independence assumptions allows us to reduce model complexity without impacting our ability to characterize the distribution of tags in the test set (i.e., starting from the right, the parametric form remains flat for some time as complexity is decreased). But, in all cases, as the process of reducing model complexity continues, the model loses its ability to properly characterize this distribution. This failure to properly characterize the test set occurs when the interdependencies removed from the model are important in describing the conditional distribution of the tags given the values of the non-classification variables (equation 4). The exact point at which this occurs varies in Figures 1 through 12, but the fact that it does occur is apparent in the drop-off of the measure of form as well as in the increase in misclassification error that accompanies that drop. In all figures, as the measure of form drops, the gap between recall and overall model performance increases, indicating the contribution that the inappropriateness of model form makes to misclassification error."]},{"title":"As the complexity of the model is","paragraphs":["reduced, the quality of the parameter"]},{"title":"estimates","paragraphs":["improves. The final factor contributing to misclassification error is the quality of the parameter estimates. The gap between the measure of form and the overall model performance is the error that results from using parameter estimates made from the training data as opposed to using parameters that exactly describe the characteristics of the test set (recall that the only difference between these measures is whether the parameters are estimated from the test set or from the training data). In all figures, this gap shrinks dramatically as the complexity of the model is reduced. The decrease in this gap indicates that the quality of the parameter estimates made from the training data improves as model complexity is reduced. Similarly, this improvement is reflected in recall, which also increases as the complexity of the model is reduced. The quality of the non-zero parameter estimates can be isolated. In the previous subsection, we considered the quality of the parameter estimates by considering the overall model performance. The negative effect of the parameter estimates on this measure includes both losses due to lack of recall and losses due to incorrect tagging. We can isolate the losses due to incorrect tagging in certain cases, namely when the measure of form is 100%. When the measure of form is 100%, there is no error due to the parametric form or to the feature set (see the discussion of the measure of feature-set above). Thus, the lack of precision (i.e., the misclassification error) is due only to the inappropriateness of the parameter estimates for the test set. For four of the words--\"bill\", \"chief\", \"concern\", and \"include\"--the measure of form for the most complex models is 100%. For these models, the precision is very good, ranging from roughly 95% for \"bill\" to 100% for \"include.\" What lack of precision there is (for models with measure of form of 100%) is due to inappropriateness of non-zero 107 parameter estimates. Discussion Before concluding, it is important to discuss the interdependencies that exist among the three determinants of model performance. The ideal model is, of course, one in which all three are optimal. But is it possible to design a model that is optimal in all three using a fixed amount of training data? Not surprisingly, the answer for most interesting problems is no. An optimal set of features is one that serves to fully distinguish among the tags being assigned. An optimal set (if one exists) or even a reasonably good set is likely to be large for any interesting problem. Defining a good model of the joint distribution of a large set of variables using a fixed amount of training data is a process of finding the level of model complexity that provides the right balance between quality of form and quality of parameter estimates (where only the most important interdependencies are included at each complexity level).","The need for this balance is demonstrated in Figures 1 through 12 and can be explained as follows. Reducing the complexity of a model entails reducing the number of interdependencies specified in the form of that model and this, in turn, results in a reduction in the number of model parameters. While reducing the number of model parameters increases the quality of the parameter estimates, reducing the number of interdependencies specified in the model results in a loss of information. This loss negatively affects the characterization of the joint distribution by the parametric form. Thus, the best overall model performance is obtained when the appropriate balance is reached. Conclusions This paper described measures for evaluating the three determinants of how well a probabilistic classifter performs on a given test set. These determinants are the appropriateness, for the test set, of the results of (1) features selection, (2) formulation of the parametric form of the model, and (3) parameter estimation. These are part of any model formulation procedure, even if not broken out as separate steps, so the tradeoffs explored in this paper are relevant to a wide variety of methods. The measures were demonstrated in a large experiment, in which they were used to analyze the resuits of roughly 300 classifiers that perform word-sense disambiguation. These evaluations suggest that the three determinants of model performance are not independent and that the best overall model performance is obtained when they are appropriately balanced."]},{"title":"108","paragraphs":["References","[1] P.
