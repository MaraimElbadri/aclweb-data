In the evaluation work, the anaphors in five test texts generated by three test systems employing generation rules with different complexities ~vere compared with the ones in the same texts created by twelve native speakers of Chinese. We took the average number of anaphors matching between the machine and human texts as a measure of the quality of anaphors generated by the test systems. The results suggest that the one we have chosen and which has the most complex rule is better than the other two. There axe, however, real difficulties in establishing the significance of the results because of the degree of disagreement among the native speakers. 1 Introduction We have established several rules for the generation of anaphors in Chinese, including rules to make the decision between zero, pronominal and nominal anaphors.

In addition, we have established a rule for the choice of a description if a nominal anaphor is decided upon which, for instance, would choose between fang zuozi (square table), and simply zuozi (table) if a nominal form is decided upon to refer to a square table. These rules were implemented in our Chinese natural language generation system and a number of texts for de-scribing entities in a national park were generated (Yeh95). As shown in our previous studies (YM94; YM95; Yeh95), these rules were obtained from empirical studies. The experimental results show that the anaphors generated by using these rules largely match the ones in the test texts we used , assuming the same semantic structures and contextual information. This shows the performance of the rules. However, in this previous work the same data served as both training and test data. Furthermore, the assumed contextual information, for example, discourse structures, may be difficult to implement in a real system. Thus, 111 the performance of a real anaphor generation algorithm based on the previous rules may be different to the .experimental results. In this paper, we attempt a post-evaluation by asking some native speakers of Chinese to judge the result of the anaphors generated by our system. 2 Previous Work and Our Approach Though the field of natural language generation has progressed towards composing complex texts, the evaluation of natural language generation systems has remained at the discussion stage (May90; MM91). Two broad methods have been identified for evaluating natural language generation systems:"]},{"title":"glass box","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"black box","paragraphs":["evaluation (MM91).

Even if the"]},{"title":"black box","paragraphs":["method is adopted, however, it is difficult to determine what is the appropriate input for generation and to be objective in evaluating the output text.","In this paper, we aim to investigate the quality of anaphors generated by the referring expression component in our Chinese natural language generation system. The referring expression component lies between the text planner and the linguistic realisation component in the system, as shown in Fig. 1. On accepting an input goal from the user, the system invokes the text planner which uses the operators in the plan library to build up a plan which is a hierarchical discourse structure to satisfy the input goal. After the text planning is finished, the decision of anaphoric forms and descriptions is then made by traversing the plan tree. As is discussed in (YM95; Yeh95), the algorithm of the referring expression component first determines an appropriate form for an anaphor to be generated.","Suppose that the referring expression components we wish to compare all adopt the above basic algorithm. Then the essential character-Input goal Text planner","Referring expression component Linguistic realisation Surface sentences Figure 1: Referring expression component in the Chinese natural language system. istic to distinguish them from each other be-comes the rules used in the components and how these rules are implemented. If all of these referring expression components are embedded in the same Chinese natural language generation system, as in Fig. 1, for example, then, given an input to the system, anaphors in the result-ing texts can be characterised by the rules used in the referring expression component and their implementation.","By adopting this approach, we need not worry about the problems of either of the evaluation methods stated above, except the objective evaluation of output text. Since there is no machine that can read the generated texts and give an impartial judgement about them, we rely on the opinions of human readers who are native speakers of Chinese to investigate the quality of the generated anaphors. This is an easier task than assessing the quality of whole texts. To compensate for possible bias among the individual readers, we sent the output texts to a group of readers for viewing and took the average of their outcomes as the measurement.","In brief, each object system in our evaluation work is thought of as having the same individual components, including control and knowledge bases (which are discussed in full in (Yeh95) but 112 immediate// X~ng Â• violating syntactic ?onstr~ts?

In the existing literature, we cannot find other work on the generation of Chinese referring expressions (or indeed on the full evaluation of anaphor generation for any other language), which means that we have no real working systems to compare with. In practice, we employ our Chinese natural language generation system described in (Yeh95) as the backbone of the evaluation work because it is easy for us to control and maintain. What we have to do for each generation system is simply to insert the corresponding generation rule. 3 Systems to Compare and the Test"]},{"title":"Task","paragraphs":["Having described the framework of the evaluation, in this section, we give details about the object systems to be compared in the evaluation work and the tasks to be performed in the evaluation work. 3.1 Systems to compare","The anaphor generation rule we obtained in our previous studies (YM94; YM95; Yeh95) is shown in Fig. 2, where the internal nodes represent constraints and the terminal nodes are the decisions of using a zero (Z), pronominal (P), or nominal (N) form.

Consequently, subsets of constraints in the above rule can be thought of as possible rules, if not complete, for the generation of anaphors in Chinese. As described previously, the systems to compare in this evaluation work are assumed to share the same individual components, except the anaphor generation rules. In this paper, we equipped each system with such a possible anaphor generation rule.","We chose three rules, termed TR1 TR2 and TR3, with different complexities among the possible candidates as the targets of the test 3.

In the following, we use the above rule names to represent the systems. 3.2 The test task","The task can be divided into an annotation and a comparison stage. Each of twelve native speakers of Chinese was given a number of test sheets to finish. On each sheet is a text generated by our generation system. Each anaphor position in a generated text was left empty and all candidate forms of the anaphor, including zero, pronominal, and full, or reduced descriptions were put under the empty space. The task for a speaker to perform was to annotate which form he or she preferred for each anaphor position on the sheets.","We selected five texts generated by our system for the test. The numbers of clauses in the texts are 5, 12, 12, 21 and 34; the numbers of anaphors in the texts are 4, 11, 11, 20 and 34. See the Appendix for the first three test texts. For convenience, we summarise the occurrence of anaphors in the test texts in a graphical form in Fig. 4.

Each box is divided into three parts which represent the topic, the subject and the direct object positions of the clause.

The problem is partly because the test texts used in the former comparison are human-created, while the test texts used here are machine-generated. The grammatical structures of the machine-created texts are simplified; they are not as sophisticated as human texts. In the evaluation work, when the speakers were asked to decide their preferences for anaphors in the machine-generated texts, they may find less complete information shown in the test texts than what they are used to in creating their own texts and hence it may be difficult for them to make their own decisions. In the empirical study, the human-created texts perhaps provided more sufficient information for the hypothetical machine to decide on an appropriate anaphoric form.","A more important reason why the matching rates are lower than before could be that in some circumstances there may be more than one acceptable solution and the speakers may not always choose the same one as the machine. This hypothesis can be investigated by look-ing at the extent to which the speakers agree among themselves. To see how the speakers agree among themselves, we further made a comparison between the speakers' annotations, which is summarised as below.","for each speaker i","for each text j compare i's with the rest of speakers' annotations and note down the average number of the matches The comparison result is shown in Table 2. For each speaker, the number for each test text is the average number of matches with the other eleven speakers. For example, Speaker 1 receives, on average, 8 matches for Text 2. At the end of the table are the average numbers for the speakers' agreement among themselves. The figures in the table show that the speakers do not achieve an agreement among themselves for the use of anaphors in this test. These figures are further supported by the kappa statistic, a standard measure of agreement between a set of judges (SC88). The overall kappa value for all speakers is about 0.41, whereas a value of 0.8 or over would normally be required for good evid-ence of agreement. The measure of agreement gets worse if only the zero/ pronoun/ nominal distinction is considered or if zero and non-zero pronouns are lumped together. Only two speakers agree with one another with a kappa value of more than 0.7 (none with a value of greater 117 than 0.8). The speakers as a whole agreed with kappa greater than 0.7 on 30 out of the 80 anaphors, with complete agreement only 14 times. To get an overall agreement of greater than 0.8 would require reducing the set of speakers from 12 to a carefully selected 3.","As shown in Fig. 4, the anaphors in Text 1 form a \"topic chain\" 4 within a single \"sentence\". These anaphors are all zeroed according to the conditions of locality and syntactic constraints in the three test rules. All three systems produce the same result for Text 1 and, hence, unsurprisingly all three systems have the same matching rate, 90%, as shown in Table 1.","Text 2 similarly contains a single \"sentence\" but has three topic shifts in addition to \"topic chains\" within the \"sentence\" as shown in Fig. 4. Since no discourse segment boundaries occur within the \"sentence\", the discourse segment boundary constraint in TR2 has no effect on this test text, which means that both TR1 and TR2 produce the same output. However, there are three topic shifts within the \"sentence\", namely, clauses 5 and 6, 8 and 9, and 10 and 11, as shown in Fig. 4. The shifts would make the rule containing the salience constraint, TR3, obtain different output from those without this constraint, TRi and TR2 obtain the same matching rate, 70%. TR3 obtains higher matching rates than the other two, 79%, which shows the effectiveness of the salience constraint in it.","We then examine another middle-sized test text, Text 3, which is broken into three \"sentences,\" as shown in Fig. 4. The beginning of a \"sentence\" is the beginning of a discourse segment in our implementation (Yeh95). Further-more, there are three topic shifts occurring in Text 3, i.e., clauses 8 and 9, 10 and 11, and 11 and 12. The constraint of discourse segment beginnings in TRP and TR3 and the salience constraint in TR3 would therefore have some effects on the output texts. The matching rates, as shown in Table 1, increase from 62 to 66% for TR2, which shows that the constraint on","4A \"topic chain\" is a situation where a referent is referred to in the first clause, and then several more clauses follow talking about the same referent, namely, the toi'~c. discourse segment beginnings in TRP is effective. TR3 obtains 65% matching rate, on average, which is 1% lower than its predecessor TR2. However, this decrease of average matching rate does not deny the effectiveness of the salience constraint in TR3. TR2's text differs from TR3's in the three topic shifts: TR2 generates zero anaphors for these shifts, while TR3 generates full descriptions. The speakers varied greatly in choosing anaphoric forms for these topic shifts: among twelve speakers, four chose all full descriptions, three used all zero anaphors, and the other five chose zero, pronominal and nominal anaphors. Thus, four among the twelve speakers completely agree with TR3, while three agree with TR2. This shows that the salience constraint in TR3 is still effective.","Then we examine the more complicated texts, Texts 4 and 5. As shown in Table 1, the in-creases of matching rates show the effectiveness of the constraint of discourse segment beginning in TR2. Again, the average matching rates of TR3 are sightly lower than TR2 for these two texts. However, similar to the situation in Text 3, the speakers have varied agreement on the choice of anaphors for the topic shiftings in these two texts. For Text 4, three and one speaker completely agree with TRP and TR3, respectively. As for Text 5, two speakers completely agree with TR2, while the others partly agree with TR2 and TR3.","The above discussions show that the salience constraint in TR3 is sometimes effective in getting small improvements in the output texts. This shows the difference of concepts of salience used between the speakers and TR3. In brief, the more sophisticated constraints a rule contains, the better it performs. Both TR2 and TR3 perform better than TRi. TR3 performs better than TR2 for texts with simple discourse segment structure. For the texts having complicated discourse segment structures, TR2 is slightly better than TR3 on average matching rates. Adding the results of the rules to those of the speakers leads to a slight decrease in kappa for TR1 but progressively better (though only from 0.41 to 0.43) values for kappa for TR2 and TR3. This indicates that the better rules 118 seem to disagree with the speakers no more than the speakers disagree among themselves. There art 9 anaphors where the kappa score including TR3 is less than that for the speakers alone (in many other cases, the results being better). These seem to involve places where the speakers were more willing to use a zero pronoun (where the system used a reduced nominal anaphor) and where the speakers reduced nominal anaphors less than the system did. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we evaluated the quality of anaphors in the texts generated by using various rules. As shown in the results of comparisons between the anaphors created by computers and native speakers of Chinese, the individual constraints we collected in our previous studies (YM94; YM95; Yeh95), seem to be effective to a large extent in the generation of anaphors in Chinese. Also they can be implemented successfully. The comparison results suggest that a Chinese natural language generation system employing the combination of these constraints might produce more effective anaphors than one using individual constraints. Although the average matching rates between the different rules and the speakers are lower than those from our previous experiments based on human-generated texts, this at least in part reflects considerable disagreement among the speakers themselves.
