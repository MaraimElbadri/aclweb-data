It is worth pointing out that these techniques are required although the input information chunks are of clause size. Another requirement is that this intermediate representation is easy to control, since a mathematical text must conform to the syntactic rules of its sublanguage. In the next section, we first give a brief overview of PROVERB. Then we describe the architecture of our microplanner, and illustrate how Meteer's Text Structure can be adopted as our central representation. In Sec. 5 and 6 we describe the handling of paraphrases and aggregation rules, two of the major tasks of our microplanner."]},{"title":"2 The Macroplanner of P R 0 VERB","paragraphs":["The macroplanner of PROVERB combines hierarchical planning [13] with local organization [15] in a uniform planning framework [6]. The hierarchical planning is realized by so-called top-down presentation operators that split the task of presenting a particular proof into subtasks of presenting subproofs. While the overall planning mechanism is similar to the RST-based planning approach, the plan operators resemble the schemata in schema-based planning. The output of the macroplanner is an ordered sequence of proof communicative acts (PCAs).","PCAs are the primitive actions planned during macroplanning to achieve communicative goals. Like speech acts, PCAs can be defined in terms of the communicative goals they fulfill as well as in terms of their possible verbalizations. Based on an analysis of proofs in mathematical textbooks, there are mainly two types of goals:","Conveying derivation step: In terms of rhetorical relations, PCAs in this category","represent a variation of the rhetorical rela-","tion derive [8]. Below we examine the simple","PCA called Derive as an example.","(Derive Reasons: (a 6F, F C G)","Method : def-subset","Conclusion: a 6G)","Depending on the reference choices, the following is a possible verbalization: \"Since a is an element of F and F is a subset of G, a is an element of G by the definition of subset.\"","Updating the global attentional structure: These PCAs either convey a partial plan for the forthcoming discourse or signal the end of a subproof. PCAs of this sort are also called meta-comments [16].","The PCA","(Begin-Cases Goal : Formula Assumptions: (A B)) produces the verbalization: \"To prove Formula, let us consider the two cases by assuming A and B.\""]},{"title":"3 Text Structure in P R 0 VERB","paragraphs":["3.1 Introduction and General Structure Text Structure is first proposed by Meteer [11, 12] in order to bridge the generation gap between the representation in the application program and the linguistic resources provided by the language. By abstracting over concrete linguistic resources, Text Structure should supply the planner with basic vocabularies, with which it chooses linguistic resources. Meteer's text structure is organized as a tree, in which each node represents a constituent of the text. In this form it contains three types of linguistic information: constituency, structural relations among constituents, and in particular, the semantic categories the constituents express.","The main role of the semantic categories is to provide vocabularies which specify type 22 restrictions for nodes. They define how separate Text Structures can be combined, and ensure that the planner only builds expressible Text Structures. For instance if tree A should be expanded at node n by tree B, the resulting type of B must be compatible to the type restriction attached to n. Panaget [14] argues, however, that Meteer's semantic categories mix the ideational and the textual dimension as argued in the systemic linguistic theory [5]. Here is one of his examples:","\"The ship sank\" is an ideational event, and it is textually presented from an EVENT-PERSPECTIVE. \"The sinking of the ship\" is still an ideational event, but now presented from an OBJECT-PERSPECTIVE.","On account of this, Panaget split the type restrictions into two orthogonal dimensions: the ideational dimension in terms of the Upper Model [1], and the hierarchy of textual semantic categories based on an analysis of French and of English. In our work, we basically follow the approach of Panaget.","Technically speaking, the Text Structure in PROVERB is a tree recursively composed of kernel subtrees or composite subtrees:","An atomic kernel subtree has a head at the root and arguments as children, representing basically a predicate/argument structure.","Composite subtrees can be divided into two subtypes: the first has a special matrix child and zero or more adjunct children and represents linguistic hypotaxis, the second has two or more coordinated children and stands for parataxis. 3.2 Type Restrictions Each node is typed both in terms of the Upper Model and the hierarchy of textual semantic categories. The Upper Model is a domain-independent property inheritance network of concepts that are hierarchically organized according to how they can be linguistically expressed. Figure 1 shows a fragment of the Upper Model in PRO VERB. For every domain of application, domain-specific concepts must be identified and placed as an extension of the Upper Model.","The hierarchy of textual semantic categories is also a domain-independent property inheritance network. The concepts axe organized in a hierarchy based on their textual realization. For example, the concept clause-modifier-rankingl t is realized as an adverb, clause-modifier-rankingll as a prepositional phrase, and clause-modifier-embedded as an adverbial clause. Fig. 2 shows a fragment of the hierarchy of textual semantic categories. 3.3 Mapping APOs to UMOs The mapping from the content to the linguistic resources now happens in a two-staged way. While Meteer associates the application program objects (APOs) directly with so-called resources trees, we map APOs into Upper Model objects, which in turn are expanded to the Text Structures. It is worth noting that there is a practical advantage of this two-staged process. Instead of having to construct resource trees for APOs, the user of our system only needs to define a mapping from the APOs to Upper Model objects (UMOs).","When mapping APOs to UMOs, the microplanner must choose among available alternatives. For example, the application program object para that stands for the logical predicate denoting the parallelism relation between lines may map in five different Upper Model concepts. In the 0-place case, para can be mapped into object leading to the noun \"parallelism,\" or quality, leading to the adjective \"parallel.\" In the binary case, the choices are property-ascription that may be verbalized as \"x and y are parallel,\" quality-relation that allows the verbalization as \"x is parallel to y\", or process-relation, that is the formula \"x II Y.\"","The mapping of Upper Model objects into the Text Structure is defined by so-called resource trees, i.e. reified instances of text structure subtrees. The resource trees of an Upper Model concept are assembled in its realization class.","~Concepts of the hierarchy of textual semantic categories are noted in sans-serif text. 23 concept \" modified-concept f- conscious-being","- object ---q .. t- non-concious-Uung [- relational-processes- - process t. mental-processes ._~- modal-qualio' quality t. material-word-quality r\" logical","- arbitraty-place-relation-~ ,- sequence","- generalized-possession","- quantifications ., .","discrete-place-relation ~ . . r\" taenttty r\" property-ascription","tntenstve ---'1 . .","t- ascription -1_ circumstantial class-ascription Figure 1: A Fragment of Upper Model in PROVERB - text - sentence - clause","category - vp -np modifier-clause-modifier vp-modifier np-modifier intensifier"]},{"title":"_","paragraphs":["clause-modifier-rankingl clause-modifier-rankingll clause-modifier-embedded Figure 2: A Fragment of the Hierarchy of Textual Semantic Categories in PROVERB"]},{"title":"4 Architecture and Control","paragraphs":["The main tasks of our microplanner include aggregation to remove redundancies, insertion of cue words to increase coherence, and reference choices, as well as lexical choices. Apart from that, the microplanner also handles sentence scoping and layout. An overview of the microplanner's architecture is provided in Figure 3.","Our microplanner takes as input an ordered sequence of PCAs, structured in an attentional hierarchy. The first module, the derivation reference choice component (DRCC), suggests which parts of a PCA are to be verbalized. This is done based on the hierarchical discourse structure as well as on the textual distance. PCAs annotated with these decisions annotated are called preverbal messages (PMs).","Starting from a list of PMs as the initial Text Structure, the microplanner progressively maps application program concepts in PMs into text structure objects of some textual semantic type by referring to Upper Model objects as an intermediate level. The Text Structure evolves by the expansion of leaves top-down and left to right. This process is controlled by the main module of our microplanner, the Text Structure Generator (TSG), which carries out the following algorithm:","Â• When the current node is an APO with more than one son, apply ordering and aggregation, in order to produce more concise and more coherent text. The application of an aggregating rule before the expansion of a leaf node may trigger the insertion of cue words.","Â• An APO is mapped into an UMO, which is in turn expanded into a Text Structure by choosing an appropriate resource tree. 24 Natural Deduction Proof Macroplanner .........................

To achieve the second verbalization of equation (1) in the introduction, however, we have to combine Set(F) and Subset(F, G) to form an embedded structure Subset(Set(F), G). Clearly, although still in the same format, this is no more an Upper Model object, since Set(F) is an Upper Model process, not an object. Actually, this documents a textual decision that no matter how Subset and Set should be instantiated, the argument F in Subset(F, G) will be replaced by Set(F). This textual operation eliminates one of the duplicates of F. This section is devoted to various textual reorganisations which eliminate such redundancies. Following the tradition, we call them aggregation rules.","As it will become clear when handling concrete aggregation rules, such rules may narrow the realization choices of APOs by imposing additional type restrictions. Further-more, some realization choices block desirable textual reorganisation. On account of this we carry out aggregations before concrete resources for the APOs like object and class-ascription are chosen.","APOs, before they are mapped to UMOs, can be viewed as variables for UMOs (for convenience, we continue to refer to them as APOs). In this sense, our rules work with such variables at the semantic level of the Upper Model, and therefore differ from those more syntactic rules reported in the literature. For a comparison see Sec. 6.4.","So far, we have investigated three types of aggregation which will be addressed in the next two subsections.

Some of their rules, nevertheless, make decisions which we would call reference choice. Since this is treated in another module, we define our aggregation at the semantic level. The following are several significant features of our aggregation rules.","The first difference is that our aggregation rules are defined in terms of manipulations of the Upper Model. They remove redundancies by combining the linguistic resources of two adjacent APOs, which contain redundant content. They cover the more syntactic rules reported in the literature at a more abstract level.","Second, Text Structure provides us stronger means to specify textual operations.
