Introduction","paragraphs":["Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) is a DARPA-sponsored initiative concerned with ûnding groups of stories on the same topic (tdt, 1998). The goal is to build systems that can segment, detect, and track incoming news stories (possibly from multiple continuous feeds) with respect to pre-deûned topics. While the detection task detects the ûrst story on a particular topic, the tracking task determines, for each story, which topic it is relevant to. In more precise terms, the tracking task is speciûed as follows: givenN","t training stories on a topic, the system must ûnd all subsequent stories on the same topic in all tracked news sources. These sources include radio and television news broadcasts, as well as newswire feeds. The initial set of training stories (usually 1, 2, or 4) is the only information about the topic available to the tracking system. This paper will discuss the algorithm currently used for evaluating systems for the tracking task, present some of its limitation, and propose a new algorithm that enhances the current evaluation."]},{"title":"2. Description of the Current Tracking Evaluation Algorithm","paragraphs":["The current algorithm measures the performance of systems in terms of miss and false alarm (FA) rates. A ímissì occurs when, for a particular topic, the system identiûes a story to be non-relevant when it actually is relevant. A ífalse alarmì, on the other hand, occurs when, for a particular topic, the system identiûes a story as relevant when it actually is not. The computation of the miss and false alarm rates can be done in two ways:"," By computing the miss and false alarm rates without any regard to the topic ê the unweighted or Pooled method."," By computing the miss and false alarm rates such that all topics have equal weight ê the Weighted method. While the pooled method minimizes the variance caused by individual story decisions, the weighted method has the advantage of minimizing the variance of the estimates caused by topic differences. Because of the small number of topics in TDT-2, and because of topic inhomogeneity, the weighted method was actually used for that evaluation. We describe, in detail, each of these methods. 2.1. The Unweighted or Pooled Method","The unweighted tracking evaluation algorithm mea-","sures the miss and the false alarm rates as shown in the","equations in Figure 1. In these equations, the summation","is over all topics, where Storiest",", for each topic t",", is the","number of non-training stories to be tracked, and where","","sys t s","","is as shown in Figure 2. Similar to","sys","t","s","",",","","ref t s","","is 1 if the answer key (or, the truth) deemed that","topic t was discussed in story s, and 0 otherwise. A more","detailed explanation of the equations in Figure 1 follows.","As mentioned earlier, P","Miss estimates the percentage","of times the system identiûes a relevant story as being non-","relevant. Therefore, the denominator in the P","Miss equation","counts, for each topic, the number of stories that are actu-","ally relevant to that topic since","ref","t","s","","is 1 iff topic t","is","mentioned in story s",". Computing the sum over all topics","yields the total number of stories, in the collection, that are","relevant to at least one topic. It should be noted that the","TDT evaluation enforces that a story is relevant to only one","topic.","In the numerator of the equation for P","Miss, the","","","sys t s","","","ref","t","s","","product is 1 iff","sys","t","s","","is 0 and","","ref t s","","is 1. In other words, the product is 1 iff the sys-","tem determines that t","is not mentioned in s","when the truth","determines that it is. Therefore, computing the sum of this","product over all stories and over all topics yields the total","number of occurrences of a missed story.","Similarly, the denominator in the P","FA equation com-","putes, for each topic, the number of stories that are not rel-","evant to that topic. However, since a story is relevant to","only one topic, when the sum is computed over all topics,","each story is counted Topics","","(where Topics is the to-","tal number of topics) times as it is not relevant to each of","these Topics","","topics. Therefore, this sum is signiûcantly","greater than the total number of stories, Storiest",", in the col-","lection since, for each topic, a large number of stories are","not relevant to it.","P Miss X t ","Topics    X s ","Storiest n","","","","sys","t","s","","","ref","t","s"," o     X t ","Topics    X s ","Storiest","","ref t s","   ","P FA X t ","Topics    X s ","Storiest n","","sys","t","s","  ","","","ref","t","s"," o     X t ","Topics    X s ","Storiest","","  ref","t","s","    Figure 1: Equations for the Current Evaluation Algorithm","","sys t s"," ","","if the system deemed that topic t was discussed in story s","","otherwise","Figure 2: Deûnition of","sys t s","","The","sys","t","s","",""," ","","ref","t","s","","product in the numerator","of the P","FA equation is 1 iff","sys","t","s","","is 1, and","ref","t","s","","is","0.

Therefore, computing the sum over all stories","and over all topics yields the total number of occurrences","of a false alarm.","The Weighted method is discussed later in the paper in","Section 5."]},{"title":"3. Limitation of the Current Algorithm","paragraphs":["While the evaluation algorithm has been successful in measuring the performance of systems, it has three main limitations.","1. It is possible for a system to get low miss and false","alarm rates in cases where the system actually makes","a lot of errors. Consider the following example. Sup-","pose we are tracking only one topic, and the num-","ber of stories that are going to be tracked is 1000","(S","","S","","","","S","","). Also suppose that the truth iden-","tiûes thatS  S","","S","","are the stories relevant to the","topic while the others are not relevant. Now if a system","responds by tracking S","","S","","S","","S","","","S","","as relevant to the topic while identifying the rest to","be non-relevant, then","P Miss  ","  ","since it only misses one story, S ",". In addition,","P FA  ","  ","since the system identiûes 91 (S  S","",")ofthe","990 non-relevant stories as actually being relevant.","But, the precision in this case is  ","","","","","i.e.","the system correctly tracked only 9 out of the 100 arti-","cles. The poor performance of the system in this case","is not accurately reüected by the low miss and the false","alarm rates which actually indicate good performance.","2. The algorithm penalizes all errors equally. Consider","the following example. Suppose we have four top-","ics t","","t","","t"," , and that, for each topic, Storiest",",","the total number of stories to be tracked for that","topic, is 500. Also suppose that the truth deems that","S","","","S","","are relevant to topic t","",", S","","","S","","are relevant to t  , S","","S","","are relevant to t","",",","and S","","S ","are relevant to t","",". Now if a re-","sponse, R","",", has a system identifying that S","","","S","","are relevant to t  , S","","S","","are relevant to t","",",","and S","","","S ","are relevant to t","",", then,","P Miss   ","","    ","","   ","  ","since the only stories missed are the 50","(S","   S","",") relevant to t","",". In addition,","P FA   ","","      ","","   ","  ","since the system identiûes, for topict","",", 50 stories","(S","   S","",") as being relevant when they actually","are not.","But, if a response, R","",", has the system identifying that","S","","S","","","","S","","are relevant to t","",", S","","S","","are","relevant to t","",", and S","","S","","are relevant to t","",",","then,","P Miss   ","","    ","","   ","  ","and,","P FA  ","","      ","","   ","  ","Therefore, the current algorithm assigns equal miss","and false alarm scores for both the responses in the","example above when in fact R","","merged all the arti-","cles corresponding to a large topic (in the number of","documents relevant), t","",", and a small topic, t","",", together","while R"," merged all documents corresponding to the","two small topics, t","",", and t","",", together. We feel that R","","should have been penalized more heavily than R","","be-","cause R"," implicitly creates a larger number of errors","by linking the 200 document topic with the 50 docu-","ment topic.","3. The False Alarm measure deüates the actual error rate because for each story it credits the system for not making a mistake multiple times. This happens because the algorithm considers all non-relevant stories when computing the false-alarm rate. Since a story is relevant to only one topic (i.e. it is not relevant to the remaining topics), the system is credited for not making a mistake for each of the t","","","topics (if t","is the total number of topics). The deüation actually occurs because of the denominator of the equation that calculates P","FA . As mentioned earlier, the value of the denominator is usually signiûcantly greater than the total number of stories in the collection since, for each topic, a large number of stories are not relevant to it. Therefore, computing this sum over all topics yields a rather large number compared to the number of stories. For instance, in the example described above, the denominator for P","FA is 1500, or three times the total number of stories."]},{"title":"4. The B-CUBED Algorithm","paragraphs":["The B-CUBED algorithm is based upon an algorithm developed to score coreference chains(Bagga and Baldwin, 1998). It was designed speciûcally to identify and penalize both explicit as well as implicit errors. The algorithm measures performance in terms of precision and recall. These are deûned as shown in Figure 3. In the equations shown in the ûgure,ST is the set of stories being tracked, Topics is the set of topics in the response, and","ref, and","sys are as deûned earlier for the current algorithm.","Alternatively, for each story, s",", Precision","s",", and Recall","s can be explained, in words, as in Figure 4. The ûnal precision and recall numbers are computed by taking an average of P","s",", and R","s",", for all stories s","in ST.","The B-CUBED algorithm computes precision and recall with respect to the stories tracked. As shown in Figure 4, the algorithm computes the numerator of the precision equation, for each story s",", by analyzing the topic that s is actually relevant to (as deemed by the truth), and computing the number of stories in common with the topic in the response containing s",". The denominator of the equation is computed by counting the total number of stories relevant to the topic in the response that s","is relevant to. While the numerator of the recall equation is the same as that of the precision equation, the denominator is computed by counting the number of stories relevant to the topic in the truth that s","is relevant to.","The equations in Figure 4 are almost equivalent to the","formulae in Figure 3 the only difference being that the for-","mulae in the latter ûgure compute ûnal precision and recall.","In the formula for precision,","sys","t","s","","has value 1 only","when t","is instantiated to the topic that the system deems","s","relevant to. For all other topics it has value 0. Suppose","the topic that the system determines that s","is relevant to is","topic x",", then the denominator of the fraction computes the","total number of stories that are relevant to topic x",", as deter-","mined by the response. The numerator of the fraction, on","the other hand, is the sum of the products of three expres-","sions:","ref","t","","s","",",","ref","t  s","","",", and","sys","t","s","","",". Therefore,","the numerator counts the number of times each of these","three expressions simultaneously have value 1.","ref","t","","s","","has a value 1 when t","","is the topic that s","actually is relevant","to, say topic y","(note: if the response is correct, then y","is the","same as x","). Therefore, ref","t","","s","","","is 1 iff s","","is one of the","stories relevant to topic y in the truth. Finally,","sys","t","s","","","is","1 iff the story that is relevant to topic y","in the truth is also","relevant to topic x","in the response. Thus, the numerator","of the fraction counts, for each story s",", the number of sto-","ries in common between the truth and the response topics","containing s",".","For recall, the numerator of the fraction is the same as","the numerator of the fraction in the formula for precision.","However, the denominator is the sum of the products of","two expressions:","ref","t"," s","",", and","ref","t","","s","","",". Therefore,","the denominator counts the number of times both these ex-","pressions simultaneously have value 1.","ref","t","","s","","is 1 iff t","","is the topic that s","is actually relevant to (topic y","). Moreover,","","ref","t","","s","","","is 1 iff s","","is a story that is actually relevant to","topic y",". Therefore, the product counts the total number of","stories that are relevant to the topic that s","actually is rele-","vant to.","Consider, for example, the response R","","presented ear-","lier while describing the second limitation of the current","algorithm.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["Given the build-test-improve cycle of development that is dominant in the development of natural language processing systems today, there is greater reliance on the use of standard evaluation algorithms than ever before. The type of scoring algorithm used greatly inüuences system development, and tuning. Therefore, it is extremely important that these scoring algorithms measure diverse aspects of the system performance so that the developers can use the collective scores to tune their systems accordingly.
