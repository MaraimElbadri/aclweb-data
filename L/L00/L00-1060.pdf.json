Segmentation of speech is not a trivial process - in high noise conditions it is very difficult to determine weak fricatives and nasals at end of the words. An efficient threshold (a priory defined) independent speech segmentation algorithm, robust to level of disturbance signals, is developed. The results show a significant improvement of robustness of proposed algorithm with respect to traditional algorithms."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["Current commercial systems for speech recognition are mainly used in the field of digital communication. Mobile access and extracting of information from global networks as Internet, as well as control through voice commands of devices connected to the network appear good condition for developing ASR systems which are able to keep their performance in the presence of various disturbance signals. One of the methods for increasing the noise immunity of ASR systems is the implementation of training with a lot of speech material, obtained in different working conditions (multi-condition training). To model speech faster and accurately, it is necessary that training is implemented of the level of segments containing phonetically balanced information, rather than on the basis of asynchronously generated segments with a fixed length. Automatic segmentation has to be also used when the vocabulary size of the system is very large, in order to reduce the time for generation of the base with the training records. During speech segmentation records inappropriate for the training process have to be removed. Those are records which mainly contain non-verbal sounds or transient noise (door slams, lip smacks, bread noise etc.) with high amplitude. It is difficult to determine the beginning and the end of each word when weak fricatives (s, f, h), nasals (m, n) or trailing vowels at the end are present. In these cases, when SNR<5dB, the disturbance signals mask the speech signal and reliable segmentation is possible only when it is combined with noise reduction."]},{"title":"Basic Algorithms for Automatic Segmentation","paragraphs":["Existing algorithms for speech segmentation and endpoints detection are based on features like: energy estimation, E; zero crossing rate, ZCR; spectral slope, periodicity, degree of likelihood of adjacent segments etc. The main disadvantage of algorithms using E and ZCR is that a some threshold levels have to be specified in advance. This algorithms give satisfactory results only in the absence of high-amplitude noise. With MLR (Maximum Likelihood Ratio) algorithm [1] an evaluation of the significant changes of the signal through the frequency content is used. It is assumed that within each segment speech features have Gaussian distribution. In this case the segmentation is reduced to comparison of the likelihood ratio logarithm of the segments with a thresholds defined in advance. The algorithm doesnÂ’t give any satisfactory result when SNR<5dB. Hirsch has developed an algorithm [2] based on analysis of histograms of the spectral magnitudes below a dynamically updated threshold. The segmentation is based on the smoothed along time noise level estimated as maximum of distribution in each spectral subband. The algorithm gives unsatisfactory result when transient noise present. Histogram clustering algorithm [3] is similar to Hirsch histograms. In this case histograms of logarithmic short-time power are computed on relatively long speech segments. They are approximated by two normal distributions - one for speech and one for noise. The threshold value is defined by the point of intersection of the distributions. When level of noise is high, peaks are closer to each other and accurate segmentation is not possible."]},{"title":"Description of Algorithm","paragraphs":["Proposed algorithm is based on the analysis of significant acoustic changes of speech signal in time-frequency domain. As with MLR algorithms, it is assumed that the input signal for the different frequency subbands has a distribution similar to Gaussian. In comparison with base MLR algorithm where analysis is realized by low-order IIR filters or Bark/Mel filters after FFT [4], the proposed algorithm is implemented by a wavelet transformation, WT. We use good time resolution for high frequencies and good frequency resolution for low frequencies (multiresolutional analysis) of WT. Thus the accurate localization of spectral transitions and transient nonstationary noise is possible. Daubechies 16-coefficient wavelet filter and 5 level of decomposition of signal are used: level 1: 2000Hz - 4000Hz; level 2: 1000Hz - 2000Hz; level 3: 500Hz - 1000Hz; level 4: 250Hz - 500Hz; level 5: 125Hz - 250Hz. Frequency range up to 125Hz is not used as it doesnÂ’t contain any information important for the segmentation.

With this initial segmentation, significant errors (incorrectly defined boundaries of phonemes or their omitting) are possible only when weak fricative and nasal sounds are present and when SNR<2dB. Because of the high level of the noise an increase of the number of segments are possible. The unification of acoustically similar segments is based on magnitude of peaks and the distance between them. Since at a high level of noise the start and the end of each word are the most difficult to be obtained, the following correction of their position is implemented: the start is defined by index i of peak with a magnitude above Th, or by index j of the peak with a magnitude not lower than Th/2 and abs(i-j)<8 (80ms). In the same way the end of word is defined. To find invalid records the following parameters are introduced: - min_rec_th - minimal duration of record, 250ms; - min_seg_len - minimal length segment, 30ms. Records with a duration less than Â‘min_rec_thÂ’ are removed from the base and segments with a length less than Â‘min_seg_lenÂ’ are merged with their adjacent segment.
