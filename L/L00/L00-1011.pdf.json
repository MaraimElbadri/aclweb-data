A mathematical model is constructed to disambiguate word in terms of context phrasal collocation. A rules learning algorithm is proposed, and an application algorithm of the learned rules is also provided, which can increase the recall ratio. Finally, an analysis is given by an experiment on the algorithm. Its application gives an increase of 10% in precision."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["The WSD is a semantic concern which has been involved in a wide range of applications, such as natural language understanding, machine translation, speech processing and so on. A variety of approaches have been proposed to address this problem. Generally, methods of WSD can be classified into two categories: rule-based method and statistics-based method. The advantage of Rule-based WSD method is of its high precision and long distance relatedness, but its disadvantage is strenuous manual work, low coverage and interference of rules. Statistics-based method provides a supplement way to make up the disadvantages, which shows a high coverage and detail knowledge granular resolution. So our research on WSD is focused on the combination of the two methods.","Because it needs a lot of manpower to tag word sense of a large corpus in statistics-based WSD method, efforts have been made to automatically sense-tag a training corpus via bootstrapping methods. Hearst proposed an algorithm that includes a training phase during which each occurrence of a set of nouns to be disambiguation is manually sense-tagged in several occurrences. Statistical information extracted from the context of these occurrences is then used to disambiguate other occurrences. Yarowsky proposed transformation-based method, which assumes that the similar sense would appear more likely in similar context whether it belongs to a polysemous word or single-sense word. So the context information of single-sense word can be applied to the disambiguation of polysemous word. Church proposed the use of bilingual corpora (Ide, Nancy. 1998) to avoid hand tagging of training data. His premise is that the different senses of a given word often translate differently in another language (for example, pen in English is stylo in French for its Â‘writing implementÂ’ sense, and enclose for its Â‘enclosureÂ’ sense). By using a parallel-aligned corpus, the translation of each occurrence of a word such as pen can be used to automatically determine its sense. ChurchÂ’s method shows high precision. But it also has the disadvantage due to few large-scale parallel corpora available for use. To decline the requirement for a bilingual parallel-aligned corpus, this paper proposes a WSD method used in English-Chinese machine translation, which uses syntactic relation and bilingual materials. The experiment proves that this method is effective. Section 2 of the paper describes the model for the disambiguation; Section 3 renders the algorithm of the WSD; Section 4 gives an experiment result of the model; Conclusion is given in Section 5."]},{"title":"2. Sense Disambiguation Model","paragraphs":["Proposed WSD method needs support from following respects: 1) Bilingual corpus; 2) Sense coding system; 3) Statistical model. The following sections give the detail description."]},{"title":"2.1. Sense coding","paragraphs":["Currently most researchers in WSD are relying on the sense distinctions provided by established lexical resources, such as machine-readable dictionaries or WordNet. But the problem of sense division is still an object of discussion. Some people suggest that the sense divisions in dictionaries are too fine for the purpose of natural language processing. Overly fine sense distinctions cause practical difficulties for automated WSD. So we define sense categories in terms of the wordsÂ’ part of speech (POS) and their actual meaning in consideration of its application in English-Chinese machine translation system. The catalogue is simple but it is effective in application. All the wordsÂ’ senses are divided into about 70 classes. A machine readable sense dictionary has been created according to this catalogue. Table 1 gives some samples of the code instances. The authors investigate the","Noun Adjective","Code Category Code Category","h Humankind a Commendatory","Y Vehicle b Derogatory","e Material f Negative","x Animal h Sentiment","r Organ k Spacious","y Tools o Probability","$ Money y Color Table 1 Samples of Sense Coding situation of polysemous words of English text according to sense definition of this English-Chinese electronic dictionary. The result shows an average of 36% of all words have sense or POS ambiguity. After having the text processed by POS disambiguation, 20% still remains the sense ambiguity. The task of sense disambiguation is to select the proper sense from the ambiguous wordÂ’s sense set."]},{"title":"2.2. Sense Selection through Context","paragraphs":["Context is the only means to identify the meaning of a polysemous word. Therefore, all work on sense disambiguation relies on the context of target word to provide information for its disambiguation. Broadly speaking, context can be considered as words in a window surrounding the target word, regarded as a group without consideration for their relationships to the target in terms of grammatical relations. But in natural language, there is some certain rules for a word to form phrase or sentence together with other words. A word may correlate with some kinds of words to form a phrase while it can not apply to other kinds of words. Correlative relation in a sentence describes the basic laws that control the linear word arrangement in natural language. Sense-driven glossary theory indicates that the legitimacy of word combination to form a phrase is not only determined by wordsÂ’ POS, but also by their senses. So context is considered in terms of some relation to the target to form a phrasal collocation here.","This idea can be adopted into the application of sense disambiguation. If a polysemous word is taken into account together with other related words in the context, the most reasonable sense can be selected by appraising all the possible sense correlation. For example, the word Â“driveÂ” in English is in Chinese for its Â“force animal to goÂ” sense, and for its Â“control and guide a vehicleÂ” sense. If Â“driveÂ” appears in context Â“drive a carÂ”, the context corresponds to two possible Chinese translation: and . If a method can be used to appraise the two possible results of translation and gives a higher score to translation than that of translation to , Â“driveÂ” should be chosen the sense of ."]},{"title":"2.3. Mathematical Description of Sense Selection","paragraphs":["An English sentence S can be denoted in mathematical form as: S=W1Â...WiÂ...WN , where Wi denotes the ith word in the sentence.

Context constraints","paragraphs":["In fact, the sense selection of word Wi has close relation with some words in the sentence while has little relation with others. From the section 2.2, the sense of Wi can be determined by its context. So it is necessary to simplify the problem by determining related word of Wi. Because the phrasal collocation is stable among POS, it is possible to find the closest related word with Wi by using shallow or partial parsing. To a given noun, for example, its closest related word can be determined by the following phrasal collocation:","Noun positioned leftward Noun positioned rightward","~ +verb verb+~","~ +noun adjective+~","noun+~","preposition+~","The symbol Â‘~Â’ denotes the current noun.
