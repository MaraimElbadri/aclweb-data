It is an evaluation-based project for Information Retrieval and Information Extraction in Japanese. The project started in May 1998 and concluded in September 1999 with the IREX workshop held in Tokyo with more than 150 attendance (IREX Commettee, 1999). There is a homepage of the project at (IREX, Homepage) and anyone can download almost all the data and the tools produced by the project for free."]},{"title":"1. Background","paragraphs":["Needless to say, the need for IR and IE technologies is getting larger because of the improvements in computer technology and the appearance of the Internet. In particular, it is really hard to ûnd useful information from large quantities of electronic documents, such as newspapers and homepages. Because of this situation, research on Information Retrieval and Information Extraction is being actively conducted all over the world. Many researchers in the ûeld feel that the the evaluation-based projects in the USA, MUC(MUC, Homepage) and TREC(TREC, Homepage), have played a very important role in the ûeld. In Japan, however, there has been good research, but we have had some difûculties comparing systems based on the same platform, since our research is conducted at many different universities, companies, and laboratories using different data and evaluation measure. Our goal is to have a common platform in order to evaluate systems with the same standard. We believe such projects are useful not only for comparing system performance but also to address the following issues: • To share and exchange problems among researchers. • To accumulate large quantities of data.","• To let other people know the importance and the quality of Information Retrieval and Information Extraction techniques. • To attract young researchers into the ûeld. • To start a long term and larger-size project of this kind. The IREX project called for participants who share such goals. The project has been conducted under an open environment mainly based on mailing-list discussions and by volunteers."]},{"title":"2. Tasks","paragraphs":["There were two tasks in IREX. Anyone can participate in one or both tasks.","• Information Retrieval task (IR) IR is the task of retrieving documents relevant to a given topic from a database of newspaper articles. Each topic is expressed by a description using a few noun phrases and a narrative using a few sentences. The dataset to be retrieved consisted of two years of the Mainichi Newspaper (1994 and 1995), which is available to anyone at a reasonable price. The total number of articles in the dataset was 211,853 articles. At the formal run, there were 30 topics and for each topic, participants were requested to submit up to 300 articles in the order of conûdence.","• Named Entity task (NE) NE is the task to extract Named Entities, such as names of organizations, persons, locations, and artifacts, time and numeric expressions, money and percentage expressions. At the evaluation, participants were asked to identify NE expressions with SGML tags as correct as possible. There were two types of runs at the formal run: one was on a restricted domain and the other was on an unrestricted domain.","We set the two tasks, IR and NE, in order to evaluate the basic techniques. For example, in IR and IE, it is also important to design a good user interface and to extract the userïs intention. However, the tasks of this project should be closely related to these techniques and the data accumulated in the project must be useful for improving such techniques.","We conducted a survey of the participantïs systems. One can see the system descriptions in the survey and determine the corresponding system performance using the systemïs ID. Doing this, one might be able to ûnd out what kind of techniques lead to better performance. There were about 100 items in each IR and NE survey."]},{"title":"3. Participants","paragraphs":["There were 15 and 14 participants from Japan and US for IR and IE task, respectively, and the total number of collaborators, including those performing IR judgments, and creating the NE deûnition and the answers, were 45.

IR","paragraphs":["IR is the task of retrieving documents relevant to a given topic from a set of newspaper articles. We used Mainichi newspaper articles from ï94 and ï95 on a CDROM. There were bugs in the data, i.e. there were duplicated article IDïs in two dayïs articles (August 23 and 24, 1995), so all the articles of these days were excluded from the evaluation. The total number of articles was 211,853, as shown in Table 3.","At the formal run, each participant can submit two systems. For each topic, systems are asked to submit up to 300 articles in the order of conûdence. A topic consists of the following two pieces of information. Systems can use any part or all of this information. Description: Simple expression of the topic. Normally a compound noun with modiûer. It consists of at most three content words.

Judgment was done from all the articles submitted from the participants (pooling). At ûrst, two student judges made judgments and basically only the articles which did not get the same judgment were judged by the ûnal judge. Final judges are volunteers from the groups which did not participate in the IR formal run. There are three judgments, A, B and C. These are deûned as follows: A : The subject of the article matches the topic.","B : The subject of the article does not match, but a part of the article matches the topic. There are some relationships between the articles and the topic. C : No relationship between the article and the topic. The number of articles to be judged and the numbers of A and B judgments by the ûnal judge for each topic are shown in Table 4. The number of participants in the dry run was 7 groups and 10 systems. The number of participants in the formal run was 15 groups and 22 systems.","The evaluation of the system performance was conducted using the trec eval program, which was also used in the TREC project. This program can be downloaded from Cornell University by ftp (TREC EVAL, FTP site).","The results were not open in the dry run, but were anonymously open (using randomly assigned system IDïs) in the formal run. Table 5 shows the highest, median and lowest scores of R-Precision at the dry run. R-Precision is only one of several IR evaluation measurements, but since it is a single value, R-Precision is used in this paper. R-Precision measures precision (or recall, theyïre the same) after R docs have been retrieved, where R is the total number of relevant docs for a query. Thus if a query has 20 relevant docs, then precision is measured after 20 docs, while if it has 200 relevant docs, precision is measured after 200 docs. In the table, ìAnswer=Aì means that only the articles judged as ìAì are considered answers (relevant articles) and ìAnswer=A&Bì for ìAì and ìBì are considered answers.

As the participants of the dry run and the formal run are not completely overlapped, it is difûcult to compare. However, when ìAnswer=Aì, the results of the formal run are generally better than that of the dry run. When ìAnswer=A&Bì, the best score in the dry run is better than that of the formal run."]},{"title":"6. NE","paragraphs":["NE is the task of extracting Named Entities, such as organization names, person names, location names, time expressions, or numeric expressions. It is one of the basic techniques in IR and IE. The deûnition of NEïs is described in an 18-page document (which is available through the IREX homepage). There are 8 kinds of NEïs shown in Table 7. At the exercise, participants were asked to tag NE expressions with the corresponding SGML tags as accurately as possible. We also introduced a tag íOPTIONALì to help in cases where even a human could not tag unambiguously. If a system tags an expression within the OPTIONAL tag, it is just ignored for the scoring. However, if a system tags an expression across the beginning or ending tags, then it is considered an overgenerated tag. The process of making the deûnition was not easy, which was partially reported in (Satoshi Sekine, 1999). There were long and active discussions on this subject at the meeting and in the IREX mailing-list.","There were three kinds of NE exercises, the dry run, a restricted domain formal run, and an unrestricted domain formal run. Also we supplied three kinds of training data: the dry run training data, the CRL NE data and the formal run domain restricted training data. Table 8 shows the size of each data set. Note that CRL NE data belongs to the Communication Research Laboratory (CRL), but it is included in the table, because the data was created by IREX participants, using the deûnition of IREX-NE, and distributed through IREX.","8 groups and 11 systems participated in the dry run exercise.

It includes articles mentioning an arrest event in the past. It excludes articles which have only information about requesting an arrest warrant, an accusation or sending the papers pertaining to a case to an AttorneyÂ’s Office.","In the formal run, 14 groups and 15 systems participated in the exercise.

Comparing the score of the general domain and arrest domain, 5 systems got a better score on the general domain and 10 systems got a better score on the arrests. We observed a big improvements from the systems which took the domain shift into account.","We found that there are three kinds of systems. One was pattern based systems, in which patterns are written by human. This can be a very laborious job, but the best performing system came from this category. Second was also pattern based systems, but the patterns are extracted from a tagged corpus by some automatic means. The last type was fully automatic systems which do not use explicit patterns. It is interesting to see that the top three systems came from the three categories; we canït simply conclude which type of systems outperform others.
