ABSTRACT A major problem In automatically anaiy~dng the text of m~lltary messaq;les In m~lar to synthesize data b~le elements is separating fact from opinion, I.e., Ident~n9 factual statements versus evaluative commentary such 4,; degree Of belief or confidence In the parameters of s particular event, comparative evaiual~ons of entitles and events, predictions of future events, etc. This paper desmlbes a m~iel which accmmta for the range of factual to evaluative Information In the message traffic, and dlocusses a means for repreaenUng such Ioformation In the context of an oxperlmentsJ system for automated data bale generstlo~ 1.0 EIACI~GFIOUND For several years, with some Inl;erroptlone, a research end development effort hal been In procmm In the Operating Systems Division of Logicon (and its predecame' company, OpereUng Systems, Inc.) aimed at the automated creation of data base elements from the text ~f electronically transmitted military messages. 1 [Kuhna and Montgomery 1973, Kuhns 1Q74, Kuhns ot ai 1975, SIlva end Montgomery 1977, Silva et el 1979e, 19T9b, Owigglns and Silva 1981.] The objective of this research has been to provide an automated capability to supplement the presently largely manuel, isbor-intermive task of meintainlng the currency of data bases which derive their InformaUon elements from the text of military rues=ages. Although some effort has been devoted to primarily Interactive approaches to the problem, and to mwmages which have highly predictable cniumnar summary formats, the majority of the research and development work has concentrated on the more difficult task of analyzing unformatted narrative l:axt with user Interaction limited to occasional sssistmlca to the automated system. A teethed system called MATRES has been constructed In Prolog to run under the UNiX operating system on the POP 11/70. MATRES Is a knowledge based system for undorotanding the natural language text of event-oriented massages tn the domains of air activities and space/missile (S&M) activities. The knowledge structures In MATRES, called \"templates a, are essentially frames or scripts describing entities and events, which answer the military u~er's bsolc questions about these","1. This work has been carried out under the sponsorship of the Rome Air Development Center (RADC), U. S. Air Force Systems Command, Grlffiss Air :'~,-~e 8aBe, New York. MlenmmmL as Illustrated In the simplified view of an event template prlmentod In Figure 1. The templatee are hierarchically organized; lower level templates deal with ot)Jects or times, mid level with evarlts containing objects and times, higher level with activities composed of events. The slots in the tamplates contadn procedures which operate upon the out-put of the Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) to Instantlata the templatlm. We are currently using a corpus of spprcximstaF/ 125 messages In the S&M domain s~ a basis for developing a scenario for evaluation of the extended MATRES teatl~bed, ms well ms a teethed for a related knowledge baaed ayltem, the Active/Introspective information System [desCribed In Montgomery and Ruapini 1981, and Ruapinl 1982] for which MATRES serves an a front end. The scanmlo Involves two simulated nations, the Delta Col~edaratton of the Atlantic States and the Epsilon Repobllk:. Both netlone have space programs, and each Is interested in monitoring the technological progress of the other, using their own sataillte and sensor resources mid those of other friendly neUon8. The sot of fifessages to be analyzed by MATRES are mainly reports of space and satellite launches and orbital activities of the Delta Confederation, which are being monitored and evaluated by the Epsllon RepubUc. The text o1' messages used In the scenario has the structure and format of actual messages reporting on S&M activities, although the lexicon is substantially different. All discumled In several previous technical reports prepared under earlier contracts with RAOC (~Kuhns and Mantgamary 1973], [Silva at el 19790], [Silva et sl 1979b]), the subset ot' the English language on which the text Of Intelligence messages 18 based Is essentislly a specialized language for reporting events. Intermixed with factual statements reporting on entitles and events, however, Is much evaluative commentary. Moreover, proms announcements of the Oeita Confederation are Included In the reports, and evaluative comments are made both about the events reported In the press announcements and the announcements themselves. In synthesizing data base elements from these messages, it is crucial to sort out these different levels of information. This paper defines an approach to identifying and label-Ing those types of Information so that they can be exploited In the context of MATRES and the data base systems which It serves. 55 QUESTION WItAT WHO WHEN WHERE TO WHOM ~n4Y INFORMATION PARAMETER8 OF A PROTOTYPE TEMPt.ATE PROTOTYPE EVENT EVENT TYPE AGENT (OR OBJECT PLUS OWNER) TIME OF THE EVENT LOCATION AT WHICH EVENT TOOK PLACE PATIENT, OR ENTITY AF-FECTED BY THE EVENT INTERPRETATION OF THE EVENT PROTOTYPE OF SPECIFIC EVENT AIRSPACE VIOLATION AIRCRAFT OWNED BY COUNTRY C TIME AT WHICH VIO\" LATION OCCURRED LOCATION AT WHICH VIOLATION OCCURRED OWNER OF VIO-LATED AIRSPACE PROBABLE REASON FOR VIOLATION EVENT EXAMPLE AIRSPACE VIOLATION A UGANOAN FIGHTER AIRCRAFT AT AB(~T 0200 HOURS ON 25 APRIL 1978 8 MILES FROM THE KENYA 80ROER NEAR SUAM KENYA PROBABLE RECONNAISSANCE MiSSiON Flguro 1, Four Aspects of an Event Template. 2.0 THE RESEARCH PROBLEM /Ul noted above, the subiengusge of the message carpore for the air sotivitJes and S&M domains Is essentially a vehicle for ~ng events. Kuhns and Montgomery [1978] presented • detailed .:ethodology for classifying the various types of events described In the .:essages, which Is shown In Figure 2, and summmtzed below. Before describing the event clmlflcatlon, however, It Is enlightening to review briefly soma example .:esaages In order to understand the motivation for this rather complex model Some mmsgas w for example, those encountered In our previotm research on the air activities domain -- may report only primitive events. However, as noted shove and IlluatTerted in Figure 3, s message may in fact be a report of • report-- that Is, It may Include e report of an event by so.:e other source than the originator of the message. The \"announcement m Is thus a row0rt of • • launch m event, which Is the basic or prlmiUve event being reported. The mmnrmunoementm ],., an event, but It Is clearly not on the same level as the primitive event. Rather, it is s report about the launch, s .:eta-event that Incidentally introduces s new Infatuation source of different credibility than the originator of the .:esaege. However, this dlsUnotJon alone Is not sufficient to account for the difference between the Initial two sentencea of the sxa.:pia message end the third sentence, whloh contains an evaluation of the announce.cent, stat-Ing that It wu characterized by \"routine\" wording. It Is thus an evalueUve com.:entary on the press snrmunce- ,:ant of the launch event Since the announcement has been defined am s .:eta-event, the comment represents another mete-leveL In fact, In reviewing additional example8 of the .:emsege traffic in this scenario, it Is clear that, In order to accurately distill and represent Information contained in the text of these messages, the enalyl:lcal .:ethodo~ogy must Identify end uniquely label the following types of information: Mate-events llon.-meta-evm~bn OIbsel, vational events Primitive events AtUtbutlva events Relational events World point events (location events)","World point qualification events (location event qualifications)","N(m-world point events, or events involving or more objects or locations Figure 2.

Part of the modet derives from the event clmificaUon schema mentlmled shove, and Illustrated in Figure 2, which was deveiooed to account for the levels of content occurlng in the event-oriented message disooume, in this clanslficetion, there are two major types of events, mete meats and n~t-mete event I. Of the letter, events may bo al~lorvartkNlei, Or prlmltive. An obaervetlonaJ evenf~ la a direct perception of an event, which may be a visual percopUon (e.g., \"observe\", \"sightS), Or In Ute cane of a sensor, an electronic measurement of the emitted energy charanterizlng the event. A primlt|ve event is thus a physical event of some kind which does not Involve an obaervaUon Or per~epUQn. Primitive evento may be attributive Or relatloeai. An attribuUve event doacriben a situation In which a particular entity hag • partiooiar attribute at a certain time or during a particular time Interval (other than the attribute location, which Is coveted under relational events), for example: WTerrex 534 operates In the high density mode\". A relational event Involves entitles which stand In an n-sty relation with oath other st a certain Urea or during s fixed time period.
