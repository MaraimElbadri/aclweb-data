One is knowledge-based approach with particular subject fields (Reimer, 1988), (Jacobs, 1990). This approach, based on deep knowledge of particular subject fields, is useful for restricted tasks, such as, for example, the construction of 'weather forecasts' summaries. However, when unrestricted subject matter must be treated, as is often the case in practice, the passage retrieval and text summarisation methods proposed have not proven equal to the need, since deep knowledge of particular subject fields is required (Paice, 1990), (Zechner, 1996).","The other, alternative strategy is the approach that relies mainly on corpus statistics (Paice, 1990), (Palce, 1993). The main task of this approach is the sentence scoring process. Typically, weights are assigned to the individual words in a text, and the complete sentence scores are then based on the occurrence characteristics of highly-weighted terms (keywords) in the respective sentences.","Term weighting technique has been widely investigated in information retrieval and lots of techniques such as location heuristics (Baxendale, 1958), rhetorical relations (Miike, 1994), and title information (Edmundson, 1969) have been proposed. These techniques seem to be less dependent on the domain. However, Salton claims that it is difficult to produce high accuracy of retrieval by using these term-weighting approaches (Salton, 1993).","The other term weighting technique is based on keyword frequency (Luhn, 1958). Keyword frequency is further less dependent on the domain than other weighting methods and therefore, well studied. Major approaches which are based on keyword frequency assume on the fact that the keywords of the article appear frequently in the article, but appear seldom in other articles (Luhn, 1958), (Nagao, 1976), (Salton, 1993), (Zechner, 1996). These approaches seem to show the effect in entirely different articles, such as 'weather forecasts', 'medical reports', and 'computer manuals'. Because each different article is characterised by a larger number of words which appear frequently in one article, but appear seldom in other articles. However, in some articles from the same domain such as 'weather forecasts', one encounters quite a number of words which appear frequently over articles. Therefore, how to extract keyword from these words is a serious problem in such the restricted subject domain.","In this paper, we propose a method for extracting key paragraphs in articles based on the degree of context dependency and show how the idea of context dependency can be used effectively to extract key paragraphs than other related work.","The basic idea of our approach is that whether a word is a key in an article or not depends on the domain to which the article belongs. Let 'stake' be a keyword and 'today' not be a keyword in the article. If the article belongs to a restricted subject domain, such as 'Stock market', there are other articles which are related to the article. Therefore, the frequency of 'stake' and 'today' in other articles are similar with each other. Let us consider further a broad coverage domain such as newspaper articles; i.e. the article containing the words 'stake' and 'today' belongs to a newspaper which consists of different subject domains such as 'Stock market' news, 'International'"]},{"title":"291","paragraphs":["news, 'Weather forecasts' news. 'Today' should appear frequently with every article even in such a domain; i.e. newspaper articles, while 'stake' should not. Our technique for extraction of keywords explicitly exploits this feature of context dependency of word: how strongly a word is related to a given context.","In the following sections, we first explain context dependency using newspaper articles, then we present our term weighting method and a method for extracting key paragraphs. Finally, we report some experiments to show the effect of our method. 2 Context Dependency Like Luhn's assumption about keywords, our method is based on the fact that a writer normally repeats certain words (keywords) as he advances or varies his arguments and as he elaborates on an as-pect of a subject (Luhn, 1958). In this paper, we focus on newspaper articles. Figure 1 shows the structure of Wall Street Journal corpus. Article r Domain • • • Ee~n~¢ Intemat~nal $ m r Paragraph1 Par~raph2 Paragraph3 1 o: K~me Figure 1: The structure of newspaper articles In Figure 1, one day's newspaper articles consist of several different topics such as 'Economic news', 'In-ternational news', etc. We call this Domain, and each element ('Economic news', or 'International news') a context. A particular domain, for example, 'Economic news', consists of several articles each of which has different title name. In Figure 1, 'General signal corp.', 'Safecard services inc.', and 'Jostens inc.' show title names. We call this Article, and each element ('General signal corp.' etc) context. Furthermore, a particular article, for example, 'General signal corp.' consists of several paragraphs and keywords of the 'General signal corp.' article appear throughout paragraphs. We call each paragraph context in the Paragraph.","We introduce a degree of context dependency into the structure of newspaper articles shown in Figure 1 in order to extract keywords. A degree of context dependency is a measure showing how strongly each word related to a given context, a particular context of Paragraph, Article, or Domain. In Figure 1, let 'O' be a keyword in the article 'General signal corp.'. According to Luhn's assumption, 'O' frequently appears throughout paragraphs. Therefore, the deviation value of 'O' in the Paragraph is small. On the other hand, the deviation value of 'O' in the Article is larger than that of the Paragraph, since in Article, 'O' appears in a particular element of the Article, 'General signal corp.'. Furthermore, the deviation value of 'O' in the Domain is larger than those of the Article and Paragraph, since in the Domain, 'O' appears frequently in a particular context, 'Economic news'. We extracted keywords using this feature of the degree of context dependency. In Figure 1, if a word is a keyword in a given article, it satisfies the following two conditions: 1. The deviation value of a word in the"]},{"title":"Paragraph","paragraphs":["is smaller than that of the Article.","2. The deviation value of a word in the Article is smaller than that of the"]},{"title":"Domain.","paragraphs":["3 Term Weighting Every sense of words in articles for extracting key paragraphs is automatically disambiguated in advance. This is because to disambiguate word-senses in articles might affect the accuracy of context dependent (domain specific) key paragraphs retrieval, since the meaning of a word characterises the domain in which it is used. Word-sense disambiguation (WSD in short) is a serious problem for NLP, and a variety of approaches have been proposed for solving it (Brown, 1991), (Yarowsky, 1992). Our disambignation method is based on Niwa's method which uses the similarity between a sentence containing a polysemous noun and a sentence of dictionarydefinition (Niwa, 1994). Furthermore, we linked nouns which are disambignated with their semantically similar nouns mainly in order to cope with the problem of a phrasal lexicon. A phrasal lexicon such as Atlantic Seaboard, New England gives a negative influence for keywords retrieval, since it can not be regarded as units, i.e. each word which is the element of a phrasal lexicon is assigned to each semantic code (Fukumoto, 1996).","To the results of WSD and linking methods, we then applied a term weighting method to extract keywords. There have been several term weighting based on word frequencies, such as TF(Term Frequency), IDF(Inverse Document Fre-quency), TF*IDF, WIDF(Weighted Inverse Document Frequency) (Luhn, 1957), (Sparck, 1973), (Salton, 1983), (Tokunaga, 1994).

Therefore, 2 is marked with a '*'. 6.4 Comparison to Other Related Work Zechner proposed a method to extract key sentences in an article by using simple statistical method; i.e. TF*IDF term weighting method. In order to show the applicability of our method, we applied Zechner's key sentences method to key paragraphs extraction and compared it with our method. In Zechner's method, the sum over all TF*IDF values of the content words for each sentence are calculated, and the sentences are sorted according to their weights. Finally a particular number of sentences are extracted as key sentences. The data we used consists of 1.92 sentences par a paragraph and was not so many sentences within a paragraph. Then, in order to apply his method to key paragraphs extraction, we calculated the sum over all sentences for each paragraph, and sorted the paragraphs according to their weights. From these, we extracted a certain number of paragraphs (method_A). In our method, every sense of words in articles for extracting key paragraphs is disambiguated in advance and linking method is performed. In order to examine where the performance comes from, we also compared our method to the method which WSD and linking method are not applied. The result is shown in Table 5.

This shows that our method is effective even in a restricted domain such as financial articles, e.g. Wall Street Journal, although the test set was small (50 articles). Furthermore, the correct ratio does not depend on the number of paragraphs in an article. This shows that our context dependency model is applicable for different size of the samples. Problem of the Method","According to Table 3, the worst results of Recall and Precision was (46.5/50.2) when the number of 295 paragraphs was 14. As a result, the result of the extraction of key paragraphs shown in Table 4 was also worst (56.5%). The possible causes of the error were summarised the following two points: (1) The formulae of context dependency","The sample results of keywords of the article, 'Abermin sues Geanges in Effort to rescind Joint Gold Venture' is shown in Table 6.","Table 6: Keywords and their X 2 values in the article Keyword Paragraph Article Domain Abermin 0.582 10.835 663.605 Belzberg 1.468 1.548 94.801 flin 1.468 1.548 94.801 gold5 1.770 2.496 52.865 Granges 0.680 15.478 948.007 Manitoba 1.468 1.548 94.801 mill1 1.706 4.925 94.801 ounces 1.765 5.064 284.402 reserves 2.912 3.060 94.801 suit2 1.099 3.096 189.601 supreme1 1.468 1.548 94.801 tartan1 0.251 6.191 379.203 word237 4.633 5.132 362.887 wood238 1.468 1.548 94.801 others 15 .........

'word237' and 'word238' are representative words which are the result of linking noun with their semantically similar nouns. According to Table 6, we can observe that in 'Paragraph', for example, some words whose X 2 values are slightly higher than the average (1,772) exist. For example, the X 2 value of 'word237' is 4.633 and slightly higher than 1.772. However, 'word237' satisfies the formulae of context dependency. As a result, 'word237' is regarded as a keyword, while this is not. When the extracted ratio was 10%, there were four articles whose correct ratio did not attained 100%. Of these, three articles are classified into this type of the error.","From the above observation, we can estimate that the formulae of context dependency are weak constraints in some domains, while they are still effective even in a restricted domain. In order to get more accuracy, some other constraints such as location heuristics (Baxendale, 1958) or upper-case word feature (Kupiec, 1995) might be necessary to be introduced into our framework."]},{"title":"(2) The error of WSD","paragraphs":["When the extracted ratio was 10%, there was one article out of four articles which could not be extracted correctly because of the error of WSD.

In this model, the sentences with term weighting are sorted according to their weights and this information is used to extract a certain ratio of highest weighted paragraph in an article. We implemented this model and compared it with our clustering technique. The results are shown in Table 8. Table 8: Our method and a vector model % Path.

In our method, when the extraction ratio was more than 30%, the correct ratio decreased. This phenomena is also observed in the vector model. From the observation, we can estimate that the cause of the results was not our clustering technique. Examining the results of human judges, when the number of paragraphs was more than 14, the number of paragraphs marked with a '*' is large. This shows that it is too difficult even for a human to judge whether a paragraph is a key paragraph or not. From the observation, for these articles, there are limitations to our method based on context dependency.","Other Heuristics As we discussed in"]},{"title":"Keywords Experiment,","paragraphs":["it might be considered that some heuristics such as location of paragraphs are introduced into our method to get a higher accuracy of keywords and key paragraphs extraction, even in these articles. Table 9 shows the location of key paragraphs extracted using our method and extracted by humans. The extraction ratio described in Table 9 is 30%.","Table 9: The location of key paragraphs","Articles","Hum. Method (a)First 39 37 (b)First and Last 4 4 (c)First, Mid-position, and Last 1 1 (d)First and Mid-position 4 4 (e)Mid-position 0 1 (f) Otherwise 2 3","Total 50 50 In Table 9, each paragraph (First, Mid-position, and Last paragraph) includes the paragraphs around it. According to Table 9, in human judgement, 39 out of 50 articles' key paragraphs are located in the first parts, and the ratio attained 78.0%. This shows that using only location heuristics (the key paragraph tends to be located in the first parts) is a weak constraint in itself, since the results of our method showed that the correct ratio attained 89.2%. However, in our method, 2 articles are not extracted correctly, while the key paragraph is located in the first parts of these articles. From the observation, in a corpus such as Wall Street Journal, utilising a location heuristics is useful for extracting key paragraphs. 7.3 Comparison to Other Related Work According to Table 5, the average ratio of our method and method_A was 74.7%, and 48.6%, respectively. This shows that method_A is not more effective than our method. This is because most of nouns do not contribute to showing the characteris-tic of each domain for given articles. In the test data which consists of 3,802 different nouns, 2,171 nouns appeared in only one article and the frequency of each of them is one. We recall that in method_A,"]},{"title":"297","paragraphs":["when word i appears in only one article and the frequency of i is one, the value of TF*IDF equals to log50. There are 2,955 out of 3,802 nouns whose TF*IDF value is less than log50, and the percentage attained at 77.7%. This causes the fact that most of nouns do not contribute to showing the characteris-tic of each domain for given articles.","Comparing the difference ratio of 'Our method' and 'not WSD' to that of 'not WSD' and method_A, the former was 10.5% and the latter was 15.6%. Therefore, our context dependency model contributes the extraction of key paragraphs, although WSD and linking are still effective."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have reported an experimental study for extracting key paragraphs based on the degree of context dependency for a given article and showed how our context dependency model can use effectively to extract key paragraphs, each of which belongs to the restricted subject domain. In order to cope with the remaining problems mentioned in section 7 and apply this work to practical use, we will conduct further experiments."]},{"title":"9 Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their valuable comments."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["P.
