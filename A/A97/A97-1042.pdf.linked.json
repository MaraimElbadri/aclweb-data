It describes the automated training and evaluation of an Optimal Position Policy, a method of locating the likely positions of topic-bearing sentences based on genre-specific regularities of discourse structure. This method can be used in applications such as information retrieval, routing, and text summarization.","1 Introduction: Topic Spotting by Position In an increasingly information-laden world, the problem of automatically finding the major topics of texts acquires new urgency. A module that can suggest likely locations of topics in texts, robustly and with an acceptable degree of correctness, would be useful for a number of important applications, including information retrieval, gisting, and automated summarization.","Several methods have been tried to perform Topic Identification. Some involve parsing and semantic analysis of the text, and are therefore less robust over arbitrary input. Others, such as the Cue Phrase and Position methods, are more robust, though generally somewhat less accurate. Of these, the Position Method, identified in the late 1950's, remains among the best; it can outperform newer methods such as those based on word counting (Salton et al., 1994).","The Position Method springs from the recognition that texts in a genre generally observe a predictable discourse structure, and that sentences of greater topic centrality tend to occur in certain specifiable locations. The text's title, for example, is a very informative position in most genres, as is the Abstract paragraph in scientific articles. Edmundson (Edmundson, 1969) defined the Position Method as follows:","\"...the machine-readable cues are cer-","tain general characteristics of the corpus provided by the skeletons of documents, i.e. headings and format. The Location method is based on the hypothesis that: (1) sentences occurring under certain headings are positively relevant; and (2) topic sentences tend to occur very early or very late in a document and its paragraphs.\" However, since the paradigmatic discourse structure differs significantly over text genres and subject domains, the Position Method cannot be defined as straightforwardly as Baxendale's (Baxendale, 1958) title plus first and last sentences of each paragraph; it has to be tailored to genre and domain. Can one develop ways of tailoring this method?","Furthermore, since the resolution power of the Position Method is the sentence, while the desired output--topics--generally appear at the word or phrase level, the most accurate results of this method may still include too much spurious material to be really useful. How useful is the method in general? By what measure(s) can one evaluate it?","Basic questions about how the Position Method can be tailored for optimality over a genre and how it can be evaluated for effectiveness remain unanswered. To our knowledge, no systematic study has yet been performed, though some variant of it has been used in computational studies (see for example (Edmundson, 1969; Luhn, 1958; Baxendale, 1958)), writing-education classes (for example, (Sjostrom and Hare, 1984)), and has been the subject of cognitive psychological verification (Kieras, 1985).","This paper contains an analysis of the Position Method. We first discuss previous work, then in Section 3 describe the background studies and training of an Optimal Position Policy for a genre of texts, and in Section 4 describe its evaluation. 2 Related Work Edmundson's (Edmundson, 1969) laid the groundwork for the Position Method. He introduced four clues for identifying significant words (topics) in a text. Among them, Title and Location are related to the Position Method. Edmundson assigned pos-","283 itive weights to sentences according to their ordinal position in the text, giving most weight to the first sentence in the first paragraph and the last sentence in the last paragraph. He conducted seventeen experiments to verify the significance of these methods. According to his results, the Title and Location methods respectively scored around 40% and 53% accuracy, where accuracy was measured as the coselection rate between sentences selected by Edmundson's program and sentences selected by a human.","Although Edmundson's work is fundamental, his experiments used only 200 documents for training and another 200 documents for testing. Further-more, he did not trying out other possible combinations, such as the second and third paragraphs or the second-last paragraph. In order to determine where the important words are most likely to be found, Baxendale (Baxendale, 1958) conducted an investigation of a sample of 200 paragraphs. He found that in 85% of paragraphs the topic sentence was in the first sentence and in 7% the final one. Donlan (Dolan, 1980) stated that a study of topic sentences in expository prose showed that only 13% of paragraphs of contemporary professional writers began with topic sentences (Braddock, 1974). Singer and Donlan (Singer and Dolan, 1980) maintain that a paragraph's main idea can appear anywhere in the paragraph, or not be stated at all.","Arriving at a negative conclusion, Paijmans (Paijmans, 1994) conducted experiments on the relation between word position in a paragraph and its significance, and found that \"words with a high information content according to the tf.idf-based weighting schemes do not cluster in the first and the last sentences of paragraphs or in paragraphs that consist of a single sentence, at least not to such an extent that such a feature could be used in the prepara-tion of indices for Information Retrieval purposes.\" In contrast, Kieras (Kieras, 1985) in psychological studies confirmed the importance of the position of a mention within a text."]},{"title":"3 Training the Rules 3.1 Background","paragraphs":["The purposes of our study are to clarify these contradictions, to test the abovementioned intuitions and results, and to verify the hypothesis that the importance of a sentence in a text is indeed related to its ordinal position. Furthermore, we wish to discover empirically which textual positions are in fact the richest ones for topics, and to develop a method by which the optimal positions can be determined automatically and their importance evaluated.","To do all this, one requires a much larger document collection than that available to Edmundson and Baxendale. For the experiments described here, we used the Ziff-Davis texts from the corpus pro-"]},{"title":"284","paragraphs":["duced for DARPA's TIPSTER program (Harman, 1994). Volume 1 of the Ziff corpus, on which we trained the system, consists of 13,000 newspaper texts about new computers and related hardware, computer sales, etc., whose genre can be characterized as product announcements. The average text length is 71 sentences (34.4 paragraphs). Each text is accompanied by both a set of three to eight topic keywords and an abstract of approx. 6 sentences (both created by a human).","In summary, we did the following: To determine the efficacy of the Position Method, we empirically determined the yield of each sentence position in the corpus, measuring against the topic keywords. We next ranked the sentence positions by their average yield to produce the Optimal Position Policy (OPP) for topic positions for the genre. Finally, now comparing to the abstracts accompanying the texts, we measured the coverage of sentences extracted from the texts according to the policy, cumulatively in the position order specified by the policy. The high degree of coverage indicated the effectiveness of the position method.","3.2 Sentence Position Yields and the Optimal Position Policy We determined the optimal position for topic occurrence as follows. Given a text T and a list of topics keywords t/ of T, we label each sentence of T with its ordinal paragraph and sentence number (P~,Sn). We then removed all closed-class words from the texts. We did not perform morphological restructuring (such as canonicalization to singular nouns, verb roots, etc.) or anaphoric resolution (replacement of pronouns by originals, etc.), for want of robust enough methods to do so reliably. This makes the results somewhat weaker than they could be.","What data is most appropriate for determining the optimal position? We had a choice between the topic keywords and the abstracts accompanying each text in the corpus. Both keywords and abstracts contain phrases and words which also appear in the original texts; on the assumption that these phrases or words are more important in the text than other ones, we can assign a higher importance to sentences with more such phrases or words (or parts of them)) Since a topic keyword has a fixed boundary, using it to rank sentences is easier than using an abstract.","For this reason we defined sentence yield as the average number of different topic keywords mentioned in a sentence. We computed the yield of each sentence position in each text essentially by counting","1 How many topic keywords would be taken over verbatim from the texts, as opposed to generated paraphrastically by the human extractor, was a question for empirical determination--the answer provides an upper bound for the power of the Position Method. the number of different topic keywords contained in the appropriate sentence in each text, and averaging over all texts. Sometimes, however, keywords consist of multiple words, such as \"spreadsheet software\". In order to reward a full-phrase mention in a sentence over just a partial overlap with a multi-word keyword/phrase, we used a formula sensitive to the degree of overlap. In addition, to take into account word position, we based this formula on the Fibonacci function; it monotonically increases with longer matched substrings, and is normalized to produce a score of 1 for a complete phrase match. Our hit function H measures the similarity between topic keyword ti and a window wij that moves across each sentence (Pm,Sn) of the text. A window matches when it contains the same words as a topic keyword ti. The length of the window equals the length of the topic keyword. Moving the window from the beginning of a sentence to the end, we computed all the H, scores and added them together to get the total score H, for the whole sentence. We acquired the H, scores for all sentences in T and repeated the whole process for the each text in the corpus. After obtaining all the H, scores, we sorted all the sentences according to their paragraph and sentence numbers. For each paragraph and sentence number position, we computed the average"]},{"title":"Havg","paragraphs":["score.","These average yields for each position are plotted in Figure 1, which shows the highest-yield sentence position to be (P2,$1), followed by (P3,$1), followed by (P4,S1), etc.","Finally, we sorted the paragraph and sentence position by decreasing yield Hang scores. For positions with equal scores, different policies are possible: one can prefer sentence positions in different paragraphs on the grounds that they are more likely to contains distinctive topics.

It also describes a method of deriving an Optimal Position Policy for a collection of texts within a genre, as long as a small set of topic keywords is defined with each text. The Precision and Recall scores indicate the selective power of the Position method on individual topics, while the Coverage scores indicate a kind of upper bound on topics and related material as contained in sentences from human-produced abstracts.","The results displayed in Figure 13 are especially promising. It is clear that only about 30% of topic keywords are not mentioned in the text directly. This is excellent news: it means that as an upper bound, only about 30% of the humans' abstracts in this domain derive from some inference processes, which means that in a computational implementa-tion only about the same amount has to be derived by processes yet to be determined. Second, the title contains about 50% of the topic keywords; the title plus the two most rewarding sentences provide about 60%, and the next five or so add another 6%. Thus, a fairly small number of sentences provides 2/3 of the keyword topics.","It must be remembered that our evaluations treat the abstract as ideal--they rest on the assumption that the central topic(s) of a text are contained in the abstract made of it. In many cases, this is a good assumption; it provides what one may call the author's perspective of the text. But this assumption does not support goal-oriented topic search, in which one wants to know whether a text pertains to some particular prespecified topics. For a goal-oriented perspective, one has to develop a different method to derive an OPP; this remains the topic of 290 future work.","Ultimately, the Position Method can only take one a certain distance. Because of its limited power of resolution--the sentence--and its limited method of identification--ordinal positions in a text--it has to be augmented by additional, more precise techniques. But the results gained from what is after all a fairly simple technique are rather astounding nonetheless. References","P. B. Baxendale. 1958.
