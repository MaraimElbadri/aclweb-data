In those research, extracted lexical/semantic collocation is especially useful in terms of ranking parses in syntactic analysis as well as automatic construction of lexicon for NLP.","For example, in the context of syntactic disambiguation, Black (1993) and Magerman (1995) proposed statistical parsing models based-on decision-tree learning techniques, which incorporated not only syntactic but also lexical/semantic information in the decision-trees. As lexical/semantic information, Black (1993) used about 50 semantic categories, while Magerman (1995) used lexicai forms of words. Collins (1996) proposed a statistical parser which is based on probabilities of dependencies between head-words in the parse tree. In those works, lexical/semantic collocation are used for ranking parses in syntactic analysis.","*The authors would like to thank Dr. Hang Li of NEC C&:C Research Laboratories, Dr. Kentaro Inui of Tokyo Institute of Technology, Dr. Koiti Hasida of Electrotechnical Laboratory, Dr. Tak_ashi Miyata of Nara Institute of Science and Technology, and also anonymous reviewers of ANLP97 for valuable comments on this work.","On the other hand, in the context of automatic lexicon construction, the emphasis is mainly on the extraction of lexical/semantic collocational knowledge of specific words rather than its use in sentence parsing. For example, Haruno (1995) applied an information-theoretic data compression technique to corpus-based case frame learning, and proposed a method of find-ing case frames of verbs as compressed representation of verb-noun collocational data in corpus. The work concentrated on the extraction of declarative representation of case frames and did not consider their performance in sentence parsing.","This paper focuses on extracting lexical/semantic collocational knowledge of verbs for the purpose of applying it to ranking parses in syntactic analysis. More specifically, we propose a novel method for learning parameters for calculating subcategorization preference functions of verbs. In general, when learning lexical/semantic collocational knowledge of verbs from corpus, it is necessary to cope with the following two types of ambiguities: 1) The ambiguity of case dependencies 2) The ambiguity of noun class generalization 1) is caused by the fact that, only by observing each verb-noun collocation in corpus, it is not decidable which cases are dependent on each other and which cases are optional and independent of other cases. 2) is caused by the fact that, only by observing each verb-noun collocation in corpus, it is not decidable which superordinate class generates each observed leaf class in the verb-noun collocation.","So far, there exist several researches which worked on these two issues in learning collocational knowledge of verbs and also evaluated the results in terms of syntactic disambiguation. Resnik (1993) and Li and Abe (1995) studied how to find an optimal abstraction level of an argument noun in a tree-structured thesaurus. Although they evaluated the obtained abstraction level of the argument noun by its performance in syntactic disambiguation, their works are limited to only one argument. Li and Abe (1996) also studied a method for learning dependencies between case slots and evaluated the discovered dependencies in the syntactic disambiguation task. They first obtained optimal abstraction levels of the argument nouns by the method in Li and Abe (1995), and then tried to discover dependencies between the class-based case slots. They reported that dependencies"]},{"title":"364","paragraphs":["were discovered only at the slot-level and not at the class-level.","Compared with those previous works, this paper proposes to cope with the above two ambiguities in a uniform way. First, we introduce a data structure which represents a tuple of independent partial subcategorization frames. Each collocation of a verb and argument/adjunct nouns is assumed to be generated from one of the possible tuples of independent partim subcategorization frames. Then, parameters of subcategorization preference are estimated so as to maximize the subcategorization preference function for each collocation of a verb and argument/adjunct nouns in the training corpus.

As for parameter estimation of probabilistic models from ambiguous training sample, EM algorithm(Baum, 1972) is a well-known solution and has been studied for years.

From the EDR corpus, we extracted 153,014 verb-noun collocations of 835 verbs which appear more than 50 times in the corpus. These verb-noun collocations contain about 270 case-markers. We constructed the training set C from these 153,014 verb-noun collocations.","We used 'Bunrui Goi Hyou'(BGH) (NLRI, 1993) as the Japanese thesaurus. BGH has a six-layered abstraction hierarchy and more than 60,000 words are assigned at the leaves and its nominal part contains about 45,000 words. Five classes are allocated at the next level from the root node. 6.2 Experiments and Results From the training set C, we first estimated the values of verb-independent parameters as in section 5.2.1, and then iteratively reestimated verb-dependent parameters of the subcategorization preference function Okl for 10 verbs as in section 5.2.2. For each of the 10 verbs, the numbers of verb-noun collocations are 100 ~ 500. We made experiments with the independence parameter a = 0.5/0.7/0.9. In the iterative reestimation procedure, the values of the verb-dependent parameters converged after 2 -~ 5 iterations.","For the 10 verbs, about 75% of the verb-noun collocations have only one case-marked noun. The rate that tuples of partial subcategorization frames are judged as independent increases as the value of the independence parameter a decreases. This rate increases from 1.4% (a=0.9) to 12.1% (a=0.5).","As an example, for the verb \"kau(buy, incur)\", Table 1 shows the set _~(e) of tuples of independent partial subcategorization frames which give maximum subcategorization preference. The table lists the sets F(e) with 10 highest preference values of Ckl, along with the numbers (the column 'Egs.') of verb-noun collocations for each F(e), which are judged as generated from it 9. Since about 75% of the verb-noun collocations have only one case-marked noun, most of the 10 high-scored sets have only one case-marked noun. However, the 10 high-scored sets cover about 60% of the verb-noun collocations in the training set, and they can be regarded as typical subcategorization frames of the verb \"kau(buy, incur)\". 6.3 Evaluation of Subcategorization","Preference We evaluate the performance of the estimated parameters of the subcategorization preference as follows.","Suppose that the following word sequence represents a verb-final Japanese sentence with a subordinate clause, where Nx,..., N2k are nouns, p~,... ,P2k are case-marking post-positional particles, Vl, v2 are verbs, and the first verb vl is the head verb of the subordinate clause.","N~-p=- N11-p11 ..... N11-pl t-vl- N21-p21 .....","N2k-p2k-V2 We consider the subcategorization ambiguity of the post-positional phrase N=-p,: i.e, whether N,-p, is subcategorized by Vl or v2.","We use held-out verb-noun collocations of the verbs vl and v2 which are not used in the training. They are like those verb-noun collocations %1 and %2 in the left side below. Next, we generate erroneous verb-noun collocations e~l of vl and %2 of v2 as those in the right side below, by choosing a case element p, : N, at random and moving it from vl to v2. pred : vl wed : vl pll :Nll pll : Nll","eel = ecl = pll : Nil ~ pit : Nil p~ : N= pred : v2 pred : v2 p21 : N21 P21 : N21 ee2 = \" ec2 =","p2k : N2k t)21 : N2k Px : Nx","9In each subcategorization frame, .Japanese noun classes of BGH thesaurus are represented as numerical codes, in which each digit denotes the choice of the branch in the thesaurus."]},{"title":"370","paragraphs":["Table 2: with tkl (%) Accuracies of Subcategorization Preference","Independent Any","c~=0.5 a=O.9 ~=0.5 (~=0.9 Optimal + 81.7 70.7 65.8 68.6","-","2.2 3.3 27.1 6.0 Initial + 16.1 25.6 7.1 25.0","- 0 O.4 0 0.4 I Accuracy 97.8 96.3 72.9 93.6 t Applicability 83.9 74.0 92.9 74.6 Then, we compare the sum ¢(ecl) + q~(ec2) of the","maximums (in the definition (23)) of ¢kl for the cor-","rect pair with the sum ¢(eel)+ ¢(ee2) of those for the","erroneous pair, and calculate the rate that the correct","pair has the greater value.

We described a part of the results of the experiments on learning probabilistic subcategorization preference from the EDR Japanese bracketed corpus, as well as those on evaluating the performance of subcategorization preference. Although the scale of the evaluation experiment was relatively small, we achieved accuracies higher than 96%. The de-tails of the experimental results are available in Utsuro and Matsumoto (1997). As we mentioned in section 3.5, probabilistic model construction methods might be also applicable to the task of learning probabilistic subcategorization preference. We have already applied the maximum entropy methods(Pietra, Pietra, and Lafferty, 1995; Berger, Pietra, and Pietra, 1996) to this task(Utsuro, Miyata, and Matsumoto, 1997) and are also planning to evaluate the effectiveness of the MDL principle(Rissanen, 1989) when combining with the maximum entropy method. Their results will be compared with those of the method proposed in this paper and reported in the near future. References Baum, L. E. 1972.
