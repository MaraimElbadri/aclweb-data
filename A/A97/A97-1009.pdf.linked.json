At the same time, many current or envisioned applications, such as reverse directory systems, automated operator services, catalog ordering or navigation systems, to name just a few, crucially depend upon an accurate and intelligible pronunciation of names. Besides these specific applications, any kind of well-formed text input to a general-purpose TTS system is extremely likely to contain names, and the system has to be well equipped to process these names. This requirement was the main motivation to develop a name analysis and pronunciation component for the German version of the Bell Labs multilingual text-to-speech system (GerTTS) (M6bius et al., 1996).","Names are conventionally categorized into personal names (first and surnames), geographical names (place, city and street names), and brand names (organization, company and product names).","49 In this paper, we concentrate on street names because they encompass interesting aspects of geographical as well as of personal names. Linguistic descriptions and criteria as well as statistical considerations, in the sense of frequency distributions derived from a large database, were used in the construction of the name analysis component. The system was implemented in the framework of finite-state transducer (FST) technology (see (Sproat, 1992) for a discussion focussing on morphology). For evaluation purposes, we compared the performances of the generM-purpose text analysis and the name-specific systems on training and test materials.","As of now, we have neither attempted to determine the etymological or ethnic origin of names, nor have we addressed the problem of detecting names in arbitrary text. However, due to the integration of the name component into the general text analysis system of GerTTS, the latter problem has a reasonable solution. 2 Some problems"]},{"title":"in name","paragraphs":["analysis What makes name pronunciation difficult, or special, in comparison to words that are considered as regular entries in the lexicon of a given language?

That does not render such an approach unfeasible, though, as we show in this paper.","• The large number of different names together with a restricted morphological structure leads to a coverage problem: It is known that a relatively small number of high-frequency words can cover a high percentage of word tokens in arbitrary text; the ratio is far less favorable for names (Carlson, GranstrSm, and LindstrSm, 1989; van Coile, Leys, and Mortier, 1992).","We will now illustrate some of the idiosyncracies and peculiarities of names that the analysis has to cope with.

However, for the reasons detailed above this approach is not feasible for names. In short, we are not dealing with a memory or storage problem but with the requirement to be able to approximately correctly analyze unseen orthographic strings. We therefore decided to use a weighted finite-state transducer machinery, which is the technological framework for the text analysis components of the Bell Labs multilingual TTS system. FST technology enables the dynamic combination and recombination of lexical and morphological substrings, which cannot be achieved by a static pronunciation dictionary. We will now describe the procedure of collecting lexically or morphologically meaningful graphemic substrings that are used productively in name formation. 3 Productive name components 3.1 Database Our training material is based on publically available data extracted from a phone and address directory of Germany. The database is provided on CD-ROM (D-Info, 1995). It lists all customers of Deutsche Telekom by name, street address, city, phone number, and postal code. The CD-l~OM contains data retrieval and export software. The database is somewhat inconsistent in that information for some fields is occasionally missing, more than one person is listed in the name field, business information is added to the name field, first names and street names are abbreviated. Yet, due to its listing of more than 30 million customer records it provides an exhaustive coverage of name-related phenomena in German. 3.2 City names The data retrieval software did not provide a way to export a complete list of cities, towns, and villages; thus we searched for all records listing city halls, township and municipality administrations and the like, and then exported the pertinent city names. This method yielded 3,837 city names, approximately 15% of all the cities (including urban districts) covered in the database. It is reasonable to assume, however, that this corpus provided sufficient coverage of lexical and morphological subcomponents of city names.","We extracted graphemic substrings of different lengths from all city names. The length of the strings varied from 3 to 7 graphemes. Useful substrings were selected using frequency analysis (automatically) and native speaker intuition (manually). The final list of morphologically meaningful substrings consisted of 295 entries. In a recall test, these 295 strings accounted for 2,969 of the original list of city names, yielding a coverage of 2,969/3,837 = 77.4%.","Mfinchen","(south) component types 7,127 morphemes 922 recall residuals (abs.) residuals (rel.) 2,387 4,740 66.5%","I Berlin Hamburg (east) (north) 7,291 8,027 574 320 2,538 4,214 4,753 3,813 65.0% 47.5% KJln Total (west) 4,396 26,841","124 1,940 2,102 11,241 2,294 15,600 52.2% 58.1% Table 1: Extraction of productive street name components: quantitative data. 3.3 First names The training corpus for first names and street names was assembled based on data from the four largest cities in Germany: Berlin, Hamburg, KJln (Cologne) and Miinchen (Munich). These four cities also provide an approximately representative geographical and regional/dialectal coverage. The size and geography criteria were also applied to the selection of the test material which was extracted from the cities of Frankfurt am Main and Dresden (see Evaluation).","We retrieved all available first names from the records of the four cities and collected those whose frequency exceeded 100.

This approach was successively applied to the street name inventory of the four cities, starting with Mfinchen, exploiting the result of this first round in the second city, Berlin, applying the combined result of this second round on the third 51 city, and so on.","Table 1 gives the numbers corresponding to the steps of the procedure just described.

The weights were adjusted in such a way that for any token, i.e., word or word form, in the input text an immediate match in the lexicon is always favored over name analysis which in turn is prefered to unknown word analysis. Even though the evaluation experiments reported in this paper were performed on names in isolation rather than in sentential contexts, the error rates obtained in these experiments (Table 2) correspond to the performance on names by the integrated text analysis component for arbitrary text.","There are two ways of interpreting the results. On the one hand, despite a significant improvement over the previous general-purpose text analysis we have to expect a pronunciation error rate of 11-13% for unknown names. In other words, roughly one out of eight names will be pronounced incorrectly.","On the other hand, this performance compares rather favorably with the results reported for the German branch of the European Onomastica project (Onomastica, 1995). Onomastica was funded by the European Community from 1993 to 1995 and aimed to produce pronunciation dictionaries of proper names and place names in eleven languages. The final report describes the performance of grapheme-to-phoneme rule sets developed for each language. For German, the accuracy rate for quality band III-- names which were transcribed by rule only--was 71%; in other words, the error rate in the same sense as used in this paper was 29%. The grapheme-to-phoneme conversion rules were written by experts, based on tens of thousands of the most frequent"]},{"title":"55","paragraphs":["names that were manually transcribed by an expert phonetician.","However, the Onomastica results can only serve as a qualitative point of reference and should not be compared to our results in a strictly quantitative sense, for the following reasons. First, the percentage of proper names is likely to be much higher in the Onomastica database (no numbers are given in the report), in which ease higher error rates should be expected due to the inherent difficulty of proper name pronunciation. In our study, proper names were only covered in the context of street names. Second, Onomastica did not apply morphological analysis to names, while morphological decomposition, and word and syllable models, are the core of our approach. Third, Onomastica developed name-specific grapheme-to-phoneme rule sets, whereas we did not augment the general-purpose pronunciation rules.","How can the remaining problems be solved, and what are the topics for future work? For the task of grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, several approaches have been proposed as alternatives to explicit rule systems, particularly self-learning methods (van Coile, 1990; Torkkola, 1993; Andersen and Dalsgaard, 1994) and neural networks (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987; An et al., 1988). None of these methods were explored and applied in the present study. One reason is that it is difficult to construct or select a database if the set of factors that in-fluence name pronunciation is at least partially unknown. In addition, even for an initially incomplete factor set the corresponding feature space is likely to cause coverage problems; neural nets, for instance, are known to perform rather poorly at predicting unseen feature vectors. However, with the results of the error analysis as a starting point, we feel that a definition of the factor set is now more feasible.","One obvious area for improvement is to add a name-specific set of pronunciation rules to the general-purpose one. Using this approach, Belhoula (Belhoula, 1993) reports error rates of 4.3% for German place names and 10% for last names. These results are obtained in recall tests on a manually transcribed training corpus; it remains unclear, however, whether the error rates are reported by letter or by word.","The addition of name-specific rules presupposes that the system knows which orthographic strings are names and which are regular words. The problem of name detection in arbitrary text (see (Thielea, 1995) for an approach to German name tagging) has not been addressed in our study; instead, it was by-passed for the time being by integrating the name component into the general text analysis system and by adjusting the weights appropriately.","Other areas for future work are the systematic treatment of proper names outside the context of street names, and of brand names, trademarks, and company names. One important consideration here is the recognition of the ethnic origin of a name and the application of appropriate specific pronunciation rules. Heuristics, such as name pronunciation by analogy and rhyming (Coker, Church, and Liberman, 1990) and methods for, e.g., syllabic stress assignment (Church, 1986) can serve as role models for this ambitious task."]},{"title":"7 Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We wish to acknowledge Richard Sproat who developed and provided the"]},{"title":"lextools","paragraphs":["toolkit; this work also benefited from his advice.
