The system consists of three processes, to handle different types of sentences, fixed type, economics-specific type and general type. This paper focuses mainly on the translation method for fixed-type sentences, which is a kind of example-based approach. In this translation method, fixed sentence translation (STRA) data plays a key role. The STRA data is a set of bilingual templates, which is built automatically from fixed English sentences and their Japanese translation equivalents. The fixed English sentences are extracted automatically from the AP corpus.","A series of experiments to evaluate ENTS using economic news in the AP news stories showed the translation accuracy was about 50 % higher than with our conventional rule-based MT method."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["We are developing an English-to-Japanese machine translation (MT) system to produce real-time rough translations for Associated Press (AP) wire service news stories. With some news topics, troubles with fixed expressions lows the translation accuracy of the MT system. Economic news stories in particular are difficult to translate by conventional rule-based methods, because they contain many fixed expressions sharing two major characteristics:","cl) The fixed expressions produce economics-specific syntactic structure.","c2) Equivalents of the fixed expressions require Japanese economic jargons.","These characteristics respectively cause two major bottlenecks for the conventional rule-based MT system:","bl) General-purpose grammatical rules are not sufficient to yield correct analysis of economic news stories. (Simple addition of grammatical rules increases syntactic ambiguities.)","b2) It is difficult to select the appropriate Japanese words for the translation.","Actually, these problems reduce the translation accuracy of our rule-based MT system to only 20%, which is too low for practical use.","This paper presents a new English-to-Japanese MT system for economic news stories, which is called ENTS (Economic News stories machine Translation System), to process fixed expressions effectively. ENTS consists of three sequential processes (as shown in Fig. 1), based on the three basic types of economic news sentence. Process 1 is a kind of example-based approach, while Processes 2 and 3 are rule-based ones that differ in grammatical rules.","This paper focuses mainly on Process 1, which is composed of fixed sentence translation, compound word translation, fixed sentence translation data production and fixed sentence extraction, Fixed sentence translation data (STRA data), which is a kind of bilingual template, plays a key role in the fixed sentence translation.

Therefore, the translation accuracy of our example-based method is guaranteed to be 100%.","Creating an example-based MT requires bilingual translation data. Kaji proposed acquiring the bilingual translation data from bilingual texts [Kaji92]. However that would require a complete syntactic analysis of bilingual texts. Our method is more robust, because it requires only a partial analysis.","Section 2 describes some relevant features of economic news stories. In Section 3, we present an overview of ENTS.

The parts of speech of the translation equivalents of these fixed expressions are nouns in Japanese. For example, the translation equivalents of compound words like \"17.76 dollars per kilo\" are nouns, as are those of \"up\" and \"down\"in 1-1, 2, 3. The verb in a Type I sentence, such as \"close\" in examples 1-1, 2, 3, is fixed. (2) Type II Although each sentence in Type II has a unique style with fixed expressions, there is a greater variety of fixed expressions than that in Type I sentences. For example:","\"opened\" and \"drifted\" or \"slightly higher\", \"lower\" and \"higher\"","The parts of speech of their translation equivalents of these fixed expressions are verb or adjective in Japanese.
