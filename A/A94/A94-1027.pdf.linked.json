(10) includes the factor P(T = 1,01d) as well as P(T = 1,01c), RPI takes into account term weighting for target documents. While this in principle solves problem 2, if we use a simple estimation method counting the number of documents which have a term, P(T = 1,0]d) reduces to 1 or 0 (i.e, binary, not weighted). For example, when a target document d has a term t, P(t = 1]d) = 1 and when not, P(T = lid ) = 0. In the following experiments we used this binary estimation method, but non binary estimates could be used as in (Fuhr, 1989).","1More precisely, P( cld , x) = P( c[x ) which assumes that if we know x, information for c is independent of that for d. This assumption sounds valid because x is a kind of representation of d.","As far as other problems are concerned, RPI still problematic. In particular, because of problem 3, P(cld) would become an illegitimate value. In our experiments, as well as in Lewis' experiments (1992), P(cld ) ranges from 0 to more than 101°.","3 A Probabilistic Model Based on a Single Random Variable with Multiple Values (SVMV) In this section, we propose a new probabilistic model for text categorization, and compare it to the previous three models from several viewpoints. Our model is very simple, but yet solves problems 1, 2, and 3 in PRW.","Document representation of our model is basically the same as CT, that is a document is a set of its constituting terms. The major difference between our model and others is the way of document characteriza-tion through probabilities. While almost all previous models assume that an event space for a document is whether the document is indexed or not by a term 2, our model characterizes a document as random sampling of a term from the term set that represents the document. For example, an event \"T = ti\" means that a randomly selected term from a document is ti. If we want to emphasis indexing process like other models, it is possible to interpret \"T = ti\" as a randomly selected element from a document being indexed by the term ti.","Formally, our model can be seen as modifying Fuhr's derivation of P(cld ) by replacing an index vector with a single random variable whose value is one of possible terms. Conditioning P(cld ) for each possible event gives","P(cld) = ~_~ P(c]d, T = ti)f(T = tild). (11)","ti If we assume conditional independence between c and d, given T = ti, that is P(cid, T = ti) = P(c]T = tl), we obtain","P(cld) = Z P(cIT = ti)P(T = tild). (12) ti Using Bayes' theorem, this becomes","Z P(T = tilc)P(T = ti Id) P(cld) P(c) t, P(T = ti) (13)","All the probabilities in Eq. (13) can be estimated from","given training data based on the following definitions.","• P(T =tilc) is the probability that a randomly selected term in a document is ti, given that the document is assigned to c. We used ~c as the estimator. NCi is the frequency of the term ti in the category c, and NC is the total frequency of terms in c.","2In section 2 explaining previous models, we simplified \"a document is indexed by a term\" as \"a document contains a term\" for ease of explanation. 164 ,, P(T = tild) is the probability that a randomly","selected term in a target document d is ti. We","used ~D as the estimator. NDi is the frequency","of the term ti in the document d, and ND is the","total frequency of terms in d. * P(T = ti) is the prior probability that a randomly","selected term in a randomly selected document is","ti. We used ~t as the estimator.

We used","D_~ as the estimator. Dc is the frequency of docu- D","meats that is categorized to c in the given training","documents, and D is the frequency of documents","in the training documents. Here, let us recall the three problems of PRW. Since","SVMV's primitive probabilities are based on within-","document term frequencies, SVMV does not have prob-","lem 1. Furthermore, SVMV does not have problem 2","either because Eq. (13) includes a factor P(T = tld),","which accomplishes term weighting for a target docu-","ment d. For problem 3, let us reconsider the previous exam-","ple; R documents in the training data are categorized","into a category c, none of the R documents has term","ti, but a target document d does. If the straightfor-","ward estimate of P(T/= llc ) = 0 or P(T ="]},{"title":"tilc)","paragraphs":["= 0 is adopted, the document d would never be categorized into c in the previous models (PRW, CT, and RPI). In SVMV, the probability P(c[d) is much less affected by such estimates. This is because P(cld ) in Eq. (13) takes the sum of each term's weight. In this example, the weight for ti is estimated to be 0 as in the other models, but this little affect the total value of P(c[d). A similar argument applies to all other problems in (Robertson and Sparck Jones, 1976) that are caused by having insufficient training cases. SVMV is formally proven not to suffer from the serious effects (like never being assigned to a category or always being assigned to a category) by having insufficient training cases. In other words, SVMV can directly use the straightforward estimates. In addition, we experimentally verified that the value of P(dlc ) in SVMV is always a legitimate value (i.e., 0 to 1) unlike in RPI.","Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the four probabilistic models.

In the next section, we will experimentally verify SVMV's superiority. 4 Experiments This section describes experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of our model (SVMV) compared to the other three (PRW, CT, and RPI). 4.1 Data and Preprocessing A collection of Wall Street Journal (WSJ) full-text news stories (Liberman, 1991) 3 was used in the experiments. We extracted all 12,380 articles from 1989/7/25 to 1989/11/2.","The WSJ articles from 1989 are indexed with 78 categories (topics). Articles having no category were excluded. 8,907 articles remained; each having 1.94 categories on the average. The largest category is \"TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)\" which encompassed 2,475 articles; the smallest one is \"RUBBER (RUB)\", assigned to only 2 articles. On the average, one category is assigned to 443 articles.","All 8,907 articles were tagged by the Xerox Part-of-Speech Tagger (Cutting et al., 1992) 4. From the tagged articles, we extracted the root words of nouns using the \"ispell\" program 5. As a result, each article has a set of root words representing it, and each element in the set (i.e. root word of a noun) corresponds to a term. We did not reduce the number of terms by using stop words list or feature selection method, etc. The number of terms amounts to 32,975.","Before the experiments, we divided 8,907 articles into two sets; one for training (i.e., for probability estimation), and the other for testing. The division was made according to chronology. All articles that appeared from 1989/7/25 to 1989/9/29 went into a training set of 5,820 documents, and all articles from 1989/10/2 to 1989/11/2 went into a test set of 3,087 documents. 4.2 Category Assignment Strategies In the experiments, the probabilities, P(c), P(Ti ="]},{"title":"llc),","paragraphs":["P(T =tilc),"]},{"title":"and","paragraphs":["so forth, were estimated from the 5,820 training documents, as described in the previous sections.
