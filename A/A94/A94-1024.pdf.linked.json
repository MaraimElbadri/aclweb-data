In languages like Turkish or Finnish, with agglutinative morphology, morphological disambiguation is a very crucial process in tagging, as the structures of many lexical forms are morphologically ambiguous. This paper describes a POS tagger for Turkish text based on a full-scale two-level specification of Turkish morphology that is based on a lexicon of about 24,000 root words. This is augmented with a multi-word and idiomatic construct recognizer, and most importantly morphological disambiguator based on local neighborhood constraints, heuristics and limited amount of statistical information. The tagger also has functionality for statistics compilation and fine tuning of the morphological analyzer, such as logging erroneous morphological parses, commonly used roots, etc. Preliminary results indicate that the tagger can tag about 98-99% of the texts accurately with very minimal user intervention. Furthermore for sentences morphologically disambiguated with the tagger, an LFG parser developed for Turkish, generates, on the average, 50% less ambiguous parses and parses almost 2.5 times faster. The tagging functionality is not specific to Turkish, and can be applied to any language with a proper morphological analysis interface. 1 Introduction As a part of large scale project on natural language processing for Turkish, we have undertaken the development of a number of tools for analyzing Turkish text. This paper describes one such tool - a text tagger for Turkish. The tagger is based on a full scale two-level morphological specification of Turkish (Oflazer, 1993), implemented on the PC-KIMMO environment (Antworth, 1990). In this paper, we describe the functionality and the performance of our tagger along with various techniques that we have employed to deal with various sources of ambiguities. 2 Tagging Text Automatic text tagging is an important step in discovering the linguistic structure of large text corpora. Basic tagging involves annotating the words in a given text with various pieces of information, such as part-of-speech and other lexical features. Part-of-speech tagging facilitates higher-level analysis, such as parsing, essentially by performing a certain amount of ambiguity resolution using relatively cheaper methods.","The most important functionality of a tagger is the resolution of the structure and parts-of-speech of the lexical items in the text. This, however, is not a very trivial task since many words are in general ambiguous in their part-of-speech for various reasons. In English, for example a word such as make can be verb or a noun. In Turkish, even though there are ambiguities of such sort, the agglutinative nature of the language usually helps resolution of such ambiguities due to morphotactical restrictions. On the other hand, this very nature introduces another kind of ambiguity, where a lexical form can be morphologically interpreted in many ways. For example, the word evin, can be broken down as: 1","evin POS"]},{"title":"English","paragraphs":["1. N(ev)+2SG-POSS N (your) house 2. N(ev)+GEN N of the house 3.

In Turkish, which abounds with such forms, such a recognizer can recognize these very productive multi-word constructs, like","ko~-a ko~-a","run+OPT+3SG run+OPT+3SG","yap-ar yap-ma-z","do+AOR+3SG do+NEG+AOR+3SG where both components are verbal but the compound construct is a manner or temporal adverb. This relieves the parser from dealing with them at the syntactic level. Furthermore, it is also possible to recognize various proper nouns with this functionality. Such help from a tagging functionality would simplify the development of parsers for Turkish (Demir, 1993; Giing6rdii, 1993).","Researchers have used a number of different approaches for building text taggers. Karlsson (Karlsson, 1990) has used a rule-based approach where the central idea is to maximize the use of morphological information. Local constraints expressed as rules basically discard many alternative parses whenever possible. Brill (Brill, 1992) has designed a rule-based tagger for English. The tagger works by automatically recognizing rules and remedying its weaknesses, thereby incrementally improving its performance. More recently, there has been a rule-","2In Turkish, all adjectives can be used as nouns, hence with very minor differences adjectives have the same morphotactics as nouns. based approach implemented with finite-state machines (Koskenniemi et al., 1992; Voutilainen and Tapanainen, 1993).","A completely different approach to tagging uses statistical methods, (e.g., (Church, 1988; Cutting et al., 1993)). These systems essentially train a statistical model using a previously hand-tagged corpus and provide the capability of resolving ambiguity on the basis of most likely interpretation. The models that have been widely used assume that the part-of-speech of a word depends on the categories of the two preceding words. However, the applicability of such approaches to word-order free languages remains to be seen. 2.1 An example","We can describe the process of tagging by showing","the analysis for the sentence: iflen d6ner dfnmez evimizin yak~nmda bulunan","derin gb'lde yiizerek gev~emek en biiyiik zevkimdi. (Relaxing by swimming the deep lake near our","house, as soon as I return from work was my greatest","pleasure.)","which we assume has been processed by the morpho-","logical analyzer with the following output:","i~ten POS 1.

The verbal root in the third interpretation is very unlikely to be used in text, let alone in second person imperative form. The fourth and the fifth interpretations are not very plausible either. The first interpretation (meaning your skin) may be a possible choice but can be discarded in the middle of a longer compound noun phrase.","• The word en preceding an adjective indicates a superlative construction and hence the noun reading can be discarded."]},{"title":"3 The Tagging Tool","paragraphs":["The tagging tool that we have developed integrates the following functionality with a user interface, as shown in Figure 1, implemented under X-windows. It can be used interactively, though user interaction is very rare and (optionally) occurs only when the disambiguation can not be done by the tagger. 1. Morphological analysis with error logging, 2. Multi-word and idiomatic construct recogni-","tion, 3. Morphological disambiguation by using con-","straints, heuristics and certain statistics, 4. Root and lexical form statistics compilation, The second and the third functionalities are implemented by a rule-base subsystem which allows one to write rules of the following form:","C1 : A1 ; C2 : A2 ; • • • Cn : An. where each Ci is a set of constraints on a lexical form, and the corresponding Ai is an action to be executed on the set of parses associated with that lexical form, only when all the condilions are sa~isJied. 3The correct choices of tags are marked with +.

One rule formalism is used to encode both","multi-word constructs and constraints. 3.1 The Multi-word Construct Processor As mentioned before, tagging text on lexical item basis may generate spurious or incorrect results when multiple lexical items act as single syntactic or semantic entity. For example, in the sentence $irin mi ~irin bir kSpek ko~a ko~a geldi (A very cute dog came running) the fragment ~irin mi ~irin constitutes a duplicated emphatic adjective in which there is an embedded question suffix mi (written separately in 7hrkish), 4 and the fragment ko~a ko~a is a duplicated verbal construction, which has the grammat-ical role of manner adverb in the sentence, though","4If, however, the adjective ~irin was not repeated, then we would have a question formation. 146","(3o) v .

Our constraint pattern specification is very similar to multi-word construct specification. Use of variables, operators and actions, are same except that the compose actions does not make sense here. The following is an example constraint that is used to select the postpositional reading of certain word when it is preceded by a yet unresolved nominal form with a certain case. The only requirement is that the case of the nominal form agrees with the case subcategorization requirement of the following postposition. (LP = 0 refers to current word, LP = 1 refers to next word.) LP = O, Case = _C : Output; LP = I, Cat = POSTP, Subcat = _C : Output. When a match is found, the matching parses from both words are selected and the others are discarded. This one constraint disambiguates almost all of the postpositions and their arguments, the exceptions being nominal words which semantically convey the information provided by the case (such as words in-dicating direction, which may be used as if they have a dative case).","Finally the following example constraint deletes the sentence final adjectival readings derived from verbs, effectively"]},{"title":"preferring","paragraphs":["the verbal reading (as Turkish is a SOV language.)

We have used about 250 constraints for Turkish. Some of these constraints are very general as the postposition rule above, while some are geared towards recognition of NP's of various sorts and a small number apply certain syntactic heuristics. In this section, we summarize our preliminary results. Table 1 presents some preliminary results about the our tagging experiments.","Although the texts that we have experimented with are rather small, the results indicate that our approach is effective in disambiguating morphological structures, and hence POS, with minimal user intervention. Currently, the speed of the tagger is limited by essentially that of the morphological analyzer, but we have ported the morphological analyzer to the XEROX TWOL system developed by Karttunen and Beesley (Karttunen and Beesley, 1992). This system can analyze Turkish word forms at about 1000 forms/see on SparcStation 10's. We in-tend to integrate this to our tagger soon, improving its speed performance considerably.","We have tested the impact of morphological disambiguation on the performance of a LFG parser developed for Turkish (GiingSrdii, 1993; GiingSrdii and Oflazer, 1994). The input to the parser was disambiguated using the tool developed and the results were compared to the case when the parser had to consider all possible morphological ambiguities it-self. For a set of 80 sentences considered, it can be seen that (Table 2), morphological disambiguation enables almost a factor of two reduction in the average number of parses generated and over a factor of two speed-up in time. 5 Conclusions This paper has presented an overview of a tool for tagging text along with various issues that have come up in disambiguating morphological parses of Turkish words. We have noted that the use of constraints is very effective in morphological disambiguation. Preliminary results indicate that the tagger can tag about 98-99% of the texts accurately with very minimal user intervention, though it is conceivable that it may do worse on more substantial text - but there is certainly room for improvement in the mechanisms provided. The tool also provides for recognition of multi-word constructs that behave as a single syntactic and semantic entity in higher level analysis, and the compilation of information for fine-tuning of the morphological analyzer and the tagger itself. We, however, feel that our approach does not deal satisfactorily with most aspects of word-order freeness. We are currently working on an extension whereby the rules do not apply immediately but vote on their preferences and a final global vote tally determines the assignments. 6 Acknowledgment This research was supported in part by a NATO Science for Stability Program Grant, TU-LANGUAGE.
