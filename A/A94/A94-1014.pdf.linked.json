The model has been implemented in a program, called SNOWY, that reads unedited texts from The World Book Encyclopedia, and acquires new concepts and conceptual relations about topics dealing with the dietary habits of animals, their classifications and habitats. The program is also able to answer an ample set of questions about the knowledge that it has acquired. This paper describes the essential components of this model, namely semantic interpretation, inferences and representation, and ends with an evaluation of the performance of the program, a sample of the questions that it is able to answer, and its relation to other programs of similar nature."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["We present an approach to the acquisition of knowledge from encyclopedic texts. The goal of this research is to build a knowledge base about a given topic by reading an encyclopedic article. Expert systems could use this database to tap in for pieces of knowledge, or a user could directly query the database for specific answers. Then, two possible applications could be derived from our research: (a) the automatic construction of databases from encyclopedic texts for problem-solvers and (b) querying an encyclopedia in natural language. The idea is to build a database from an encyclopedic text on the fly. Then, if a user asks the question, say, Which bears eat seals? the system would reply by saying something like \"I don't know. But, wait a minute, I am going to read this article and let you know.\" In the process of reading the article, the system builds a small knowledge base about bears and calls the","*This research is being funded by NASA-KSC Contract NAG-10-0120 question-answering system to answer any question"]},{"title":"posed","paragraphs":["by an expert system or a human. The long-term goal of our research is to read an entire article on, say bears, and to build a knowledge base about bears. Since this goal requires dealing with an extraordinary number of research issues, we have concentrated on a series of topics about animals, in-cluding diet, habitat, and classification. A skimmer scans the article for sentences relevant to a given topic and passes these sentences to the understanding system, called SNOWY, for complete parsing, interpretation, concept formation, concept recognition and integration in long-term memory (LTM). But, if, in the process of learning about the dietary habits of, say beetles, the program is told that they cultivate fungi, and the program is able to interpret that sentence, that knowledge will also be integrated in LTM. Consequently, our approach to understanding expository texts is a bottom-up approach in which final knowledge representation structures are built from the logical form of the sentences, without intervening scriptal or frame knowledge about the topic. Hence, our system does not start with a frame containing the main slots to be filled for a topic, say \"diet,\" as in recent MUC projects (Sundheim, 1992), but rather it will build everything relevant to diet from the output of the interpretation phase. Then, when we are talking about the topic, it will not make any difference if the sentences refer to what the animals eat, or what eats them. Every aspect dealing with the general idea of ingest can be analyzed and properly integrated into memory. Our corpora for testing our ideas has been The World Book Encyclopedia (World Book, 1987), which is one or two levels less complex than the Collier's Encyclopedia, which, in turn, is less complex than the Encyclopaedia Britannica."]},{"title":"2 Interpretation","paragraphs":["In order for the integration component to integrate a concept in LTM, a successful parse and interpretation needs to be produced for a sentence or at least for one of its clauses.

Prepositional phrases are left unattached inside the structure built by the parser. It is up to the interpreter to attach them, identify their meaning and the thematic roles that they may stand for. The parser is a deterministic machine, containing mechanisms for minimizing the need for backing up. The average amount of time in parsing a sentence from the encyclopedia is about one second. The parser has presently a lexicon of about 35,000 words. The rate of success of produc-ing a full and correct parse of a sentence is, as of this writing, 76.8% for this Encyclopedia (see below for a detailed discussion of test results and machine used).

But, the fact is that an encyclopedia article may refer to the dietary habits in a variety of manners. Figure 3 contains a hierarchy about the diet topic. The verbs that trigger these verbal concepts are indicated by writing [verb]. The verb \"dig out\" triggers the action dig-r. Those verbal concepts from which an ingest relation is inferred are indicated by writing an asterisk by its side. The representation of dig-r is:","(dlg-r (is-a (action))","(subj (animal (actor)) (machine (actor)))","(obj (physical-thing (theme)))","(addition-roles (fire-one","((and (if% is-a actor animal)","(ife'/o is-a theme anin~at¢))","(add (((actor (actot)) (pr (ingest))","(theme (theme)))))))))","The representation of dig-r is similar to the previous verbal concepts, except for the entry that says addition-rule. This is an inference rule saying that if the actor of this action is an animal and the theme is an animate, then add to LTM the relation saying that the actor ingests the theme. This rule permits the acquisition of the fact that bears eat squirrels and mice from the sentence A grizzly has long, curved claws that it uses chiefly to dig out ground squirrels and mice. Similar inference rules are stored in the other actions marked with an asterisk. Then, if the system reads the sentence Bears are fond of honey, it will infer that they eat honey. The inference rules are also inherited from the nodes representing the actions in the hierarchy. Hence, if the verbal concept animal-fish, shown in Figure 3, was suggested for the sentence Owls have been known to fish in shallow creeks, we would inherit an addition rule from the verbal concept animal-hunt which would then infer an ingest relation. - action","*transport *animal-hum huraan-htmt harm *dig-r ingest","[~k~p] A [,l~k] ~oot] ~/~ ]~g~] [,wallow[ / \\ [search / ~. *cause- *destroy *damage ]dig-up[ [consume]","to-ule [devour] / \\ !\",~']. / \\'D~lll tenasel / x, [nibble]","body-part ]chew]","]gulp-down]","[skin] {gobble-up]","animal-steal animal-captm'e-aulmal {gotgc]","[steal] [trap] I [catch] [feed-on]"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["]live-on[","]take.away] [seize] ]capture] ]em] [take] [ingest] l~h] *expedence-af fection- for","animal-fish ]ate fond-of[ [take-in]","[fish] ]like] ]keep-down[","]love[","[prefer] -- Solid Lines - 1S-A links Figure 3: Conceptual Verbs Organizing the Topic","The hierarchy is also helpful in avoiding incorrect inferences. Sentences discussing humans hunting animals do not automatically imply ingest relations, especiMly when an explicit purpose is given which is not ingest-related. For example in People hunt some kinds of seals for their soft fur, it is unlikely that the people mentioned will eat those seals. Therefore, we have separate verbal concepts for hunt relations where humans are the actors, whose inference rules do not suggest ingest relations, except in cases like Eskimos hunt polar bears for food. Furthermore, addition rules typically have constraints within their antecedents to prevent inappropriate inferences, i.e., we would not want to infer an ingest relation when processing the sentence Tigers search for warm places to sleep during the day, and a constraint on the theme of \"search for\" to be at least animate rejects the inference."]},{"title":"4 Interpreting Noun Phrases and Restrictive Modifiers","paragraphs":["Detecting classification relations in the text becomes a must, not only if questions of the type Which owls eat fish?, or Which eagles eat hyraxes? are to be answered, but also for the acquisition of the knowledge in sentences like The prey of polar bears consists of seals, or The diet of bears consists of nuts, berries and small rodents. In order to achieve this, complex noun groups and restrictive modifiers are represented by the noun group interpreter as classification hierarchies. One of the senses of \"diet\" is represented as: Xl (cf (is-a (food) R1)), where R1 is the relation ingest with actor = animal, and theme = food. Then, \"the diet of bears\" is represented as the concept X2 (cf (is-a (food) R2)), where R2 is the relation ingest with actor = bear, and theme = food. The slot cf contains the necessary and sufficient conditions that define the concept X2. Then, the meaning of X2 is: V(z)(X2(z) ~ Food(z) A R2(z)) 86","The same interpretation is given to restrictive relative clauses.

The interpretation of complex nouns proceeds by attempting to determine the meaning of pairs of items in the complex noun, utilizing a scheme that combines the items in the complex noun from left to right. For example, in the interpretation of \"big red wine bottle\" an attempt is made to find a meaning for the terms \"big red,"]},{"title":"....","paragraphs":["big wine,\" \"big bottle,\" \"red wine,\" \"red bottle\" and \"wine bottle.\" If one item in the complex noun can be paired (i.e., a meaning can be found) with more than one other item in the complex noun, then the algorithm returns more than one interpretation for the complex noun, and disambiguation routines are activated. In our example, a meaning is found for \"big bottle,\" \"red wine,\" \"red bottle,\" and \"wine bottle,\" from which the algorithm returns the two possible interpretations: (bottle (size (big)) (color (red)) (pertain-to (wine))) (bottle (size (big)) (pertain-to (wine (color (red)))))","Finding the meaning of terms of the form \"iteml item2\" reduces to finding a relation that connects the concepts corresponding to \"iteml\" and \"item2\" in LTM.

The letter \"B\" and the letter \"M\" were chosen. The texts were then selected from those volumes. In December of 1993, an article about birds was chosen. No component of the system (lexicon, parser, interpreter, etc.) was preprepared with information about this article. The lexicon of the parser consisted of 10,000 words. This text was the largest article that the system had analyzed, contMning approximately 1330 sentences and 16,000 words. None of the designers of the system read this article prior to the test. And even if they had read it, it would have been of very little use because the system has reached such complexity that it is not easy to assess how it is going to perform in an article of 1330 sentences.","The first row of Table 1 indicates that 145 sentences were selected from the bird text by a keyword/pattern-based skimmer. Of these 145 sentences, 91 were relevant to the dietary habits domain. A total of 23 relevant sentences were missed, primarily due to keywords or patterns not contemplated. An example of sentence that is relevant but was not selected is Robins and sparrows, for example, are highly effective against cabbageworms, tomato worms, and leaf beetles. The parser was able to produce a correct parse for 58 of the 91 relevant sentences (64%), even in cases where the sentence contained unknown words. Among the sentences successfully parsed, the parser encountered some 40 unknown words of which approximately 70% were names of birds, such as \"grosbeaks\", \"flycatchers\", \"titmice\", \"thrashers,\" etc., and 30% were common words. Of those 58 parsed sentences, 32 (55%) were interpreted correctly. The output for these 32 sentences was then passed to the formation, recognition, and integration phases to be inserted into LTM. Interpretation failures can be attributed to missing VM rules, comparatives, and problems of anaphoric reference.","Later, in April of 1994, three more texts were randomly chosen for testing. A summary of the results for those three tests is also given in Table 1.

The average time to completely process a selected sentence on this platform was 3.1 seconds.

Therefore, the average time for processing a sentence is actually less than -3.'1 seconds.","The following is a list of natural language questions posed to the system after reading the bird, bat, and monkey articles and the contents of the system-generated answers. Note that the system output has been Mtered and condensed for the sake of brevity. In answering the questions, the system uses classification-based reasoning, not theorem proving. Many complex chains of inferences can be obtained by keeping memory organized in a principled manner. In those cases in which a question asks about a concept that does not exist in LTM, the classifier is activated to place that concept in LTM and obtain an answer. See (Gomez and Segami, 1991) for a detailed discussion of all these issues and the theorems proving the soundness of the inference algorithms.

However, the overall approach to the interpretation task presented here differs from that work. In approaching the problem of unrestricted texts, we agree with those researchers (Hobbs, 1991; Grishman et al., 1991) who think that it is possible to build correct parses and interpretations for realworld texts. In fact, it is hard for us to see how statistical methods (de Marcken, 1990; Church et al., 1991) could be used for building knowledge-bases with sufficient expressive power to correctly answer questions posed by expert systems or human users. We think that the same critique applies to skimmers (Lehnert et al., 1991), but for very different reasons. In order to guarantee the correctness of the knowledge-base built, every element in the sentence needs to be interpreted. For instance, if the adverb \"mostly\" is not interpreted in the sentence These owls eat mostly rodents, the integrity of the knowledge-base built is not going to suffer greatly. But, if we are talking about the adverb \"rarely\" in the sentence These owls rarely eat rodents, the situation becomes much more serious, as we found out.","This work has advanced a new approach to semantic interpretation that occupies a middle ground between those approaches that rely heavily on the parser for building structures and attaching PPs, subordinate clauses, etc. (Grishman et al., 1991; Hobbs, 1978; Tomita, 1985) and semantic-centered approaches (Riesbeck and Martin, 1986; Cardie and Lehnert, 1991; Slator and Wilks, 1991). Our parser delegates all the burden of dealing with structural ambiguity (attachment of PPs, relative clauses, subordinate clauses, etc.) to the interpreter. That is one of the reasons why it is so fast. The interpreter has a very sophisticated algorithm that uses the information built in the verbal concepts in order to attach PPs. Yet, if the parser does not build a parse, albeit a shallow one, the interpreter will not know what to do. Moreover, the interpreter does not question the parser when it says this constituent is an obj, or subj, or a time-np, etc. This is a situation that we are not happy about, because the parser identifies some constituents incorrectly, especially the time-np. We are studying mechanisms under which the interpreter will override the parser and will get it out of trouble in processing very complex sentences (Krupka et al., 1991; Jacobs et al., 1991). 8 Conclusions We have presented a method for the acquisition of knowledge from encyclopedic texts. The method depends on understanding what is being read, which in turn depends on: (1) providing a successful parse and interpretation for a sentence, (2) building final knowledge representation structures from the logical form of the sentence, which involves creating new concepts and relations as the system is reading, and (3) integrating in LTM those concepts and relations that the recognizer algorithm fails to recognize, which in many cases involves the reorganization of concepts in LTM.","The results that are reported in this paper are very encouraging, because a high percentage of the failures are due to some incomplete implementations of some aspects of the system. For instance, in dealing with anaphora we have incorporated in our system some of the ideas reported in (Grosz, 1983; Hobbs, 1978), but our work is clearly insufficient in that regard. A major hole in the interpreter, as of this writing, is that it does not interpret comparatives, except very simple ones like quantifiers, e.g., \"more than 2.\" The interpreter needs to have mechanisms in place to recover the elliptical elements in comparatives, which in many cases require solving extrasentential reference, e.g., The golden eagle defends a territory of about 20 to 60 square miles. The bald eagle holds a smaller territory. The skimmer uses very rudimentary techniques, and there is a lot of room for improvement here. In any case, this has not been a major concern of this research. Moreover, because the system is so incredibly fast, if the skimmer overgenerates, it is not much of a problem. An aspect related to the skimmer that we have no space to discussis that it became necessary to build an algorithm to recognize subclasses of the class of animals being searched for every question. For instance, if the question is Do sharks eat plankton, this algorithm analyzes every sentence in the encyclopedic article, before being passed to the skimmer, searching for NPs denoting subclasses of sharks. This is necessary because the author may introduce the concept \"Mako sharks\" in a context unrelated to the relation 89"]},{"title":"ingest, and consequently, the skimmer is not going to select this sentence. Then, if the author later on says Makos feed on other fish, including herring, mackerel, and swordfish, the system has no way to relate \"Mako\" to sharks, missing the fact that sharks feed on herring, mackerel, and swordfish. In June, we tested the parser on 2900 sentences from 25 articles, including non-animal articles such as blackholes, cancer, computer chips, napoleon, greenhouse effect, etc., and the rate of success was 76.8%. However, some sentences are still not parsed because some subcategorizations of verbs are wrong or incomplete, or the phrasal lexicon is incomplete. We are confident that the parser may reach a plateau at 85% or 90% for this Encyclopedia. The remaining 10% or 15% may require considerable help from the interpreter to be parsed.
