Finally, heuristics based on changes in character type obviously do not apply to kanji-only sequences.","Although kanji sequences are difficult to segment, they can comprise a significant portion of Japanese text, as shown in Figure 1. Since sequences of more than 3 kanji generally consist of more than one word, at least 21.2% of 1993 Nikkei newswire consists of kanji sequences requiring segmentation. Thus, accuracy on kanji sequences is an important aspect of the total segmentation process.","As an alternative to lexico-grammatical and supervised approaches, we propose a simple, effi-241 cient segmentation method which learns mostly from very large amounts of unsegmented training data, thus avoiding the costs of building a lexicon or grammar or hand-segmenting large amounts of training data. Some key advantages of this method are:","• No Japanese-specific rules are employed, enhancing portability to other languages.","• A very small number of pre-segmented training examples (as few as 5 in our experiments) are needed for good performance, as long as large amounts of unsegmented data are available.","• For long kanji strings, the method produces results rivalling those produced by Juman 3.61 (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998) and Chasen 1.0 (Matsumoto et al., 1997), two morphological analyzers in widespread use. For instance, we achieve 5% higher word precision and 6% better morpheme recall. 2 Algorithm Our algorithm employs counts of character n-grams in an unsegmented corpus to make segmentation decisions. We illustrate its use with an example (see Figure 2).","Let \"A B C D W X Y Z\" represent an eight-kanji sequence. To decide whether there should be a word boundary between D and W, we check whether n-grams that are adjacent to the proposed boundary, such as the 4-grams sl =\"A B C D\" and 82 =\"W X Y Z\", tend to be more frequent than n-grams that straddle it, such as the 4-gram tl ---- \"B C D W\". If so, we have evidence of a word boundary between D and W, since there seems to be relatively little cohesion between the characters on opposite sides of this gap.","The n-gram orders used as evidence in the segmentation decision are specified by the set N. For instance, if N = {4} in our example, then we pose the six questions of the form, \"Is #(s~) > #(tj)?\", where #(x) denotes the number of occurrences of x in the (unsegmented) training corpus.

Note that it also controls the granularity of the segmentation: low thresholds encourage shorter segments.","Both the count acquisition and the testing phase are efficient. Computing n-gram statistics for all possible values of n simultaneously can be done in O(m log m) time using suffix arrays, where m is the training corpus size (Manber and Myers, 1993; Nagao and Mori, 1994).

To obtain the gold-standard annotations, we segmented the sequences by hand, using an observa-tion of Takeda and Fujisaki (1987) that many kanji compound words consist of two-character stem words together with one-character prefixes and suffixes. Using this terminology, our two-level bracketing annotation may be summarized as follows. 3 At","3A complete description of the annotation policy, including the treatment of numeric expressions, may be found in a technical report (Ando and Lee, 1999). the word level, a stem and its affixes are bracketed together as a single unit. At the morpheme level, stems are divided from their affixes. For example, although both naga-no (Nagano) and shi (city) can appear as individual words, naga-no-shi (Nagano city) is bracketed as [[naga-no][shi]], since here shi serves as a suffix. Loosely speaking, word-level bracketing demarcates discourse entities, whereas morpheme-level brackets enclose strings that cannot be further segmented without loss of meaning. 4 For instance, if one segments naga-no in naga-no-shi into naga (long) and no (field), the intended mean-ing disappears. Here is an example sequence from our datasets:","Three native Japanese speakers participated in the annotation: one segmented all the held-out data based on the above rules, and the other two reviewed 350 sequences in total.

Juman and Chasen use lexicons and grammars developed by human experts. Our algorithm, not having access to such pre-compiled knowledge bases, must of necessity draw on other information sources (in this case, a very large unsegmented corpus and a few pre-segmented examples) to compensate for this lack. Since we are in-terested in whether using simple statistics can match the performance of labor-intensive methods, we do not view these information sources as conveying an unfair advantage, especially since the annotated training sets were small, available to the morphological analyzers, and disjoint from the test sets. 4 Results We report the average results over the five test sets using the optimal parameter settings for the corresponding training sets (we tried all nonempty subsets of {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for the set of n-gram orders N and all values in {.05, .1, .15,..., 1} for the threshold t) 7.

In contrast to our mostly-unsupervised method, morphological analyzers need a lexicon and grammar rules built using human expertise. The workload in creating dictionaries on the order of hundreds of thousands of words (the size of Chasen's and Juman's default lexicons) is clearly much larger than annotating the small parameter-training sets for our algorithm. We also avoid the need to segment a large amount of parameter-training data because our algorithm draws almost all its information from an unsegmented corpus. Indeed, the only human effort involved in our algorithm is pre-segmenting the five 50-sequence parameter training sets, which took only 42 minutes. In contrast, previously proposed supervised approaches have used segmented training sets ranging from 1000-5000 sentences (Kashioka et al., 1998) to 190,000 sentences (Nagata, 1996a).","To test how much annotated training data is actually necessary, we experimented with using miniscule parameter-training sets: five sets of only five strings each (from which any sequences repeated in the test data were discarded). It took only 4 minutes to perform the hand segmentation in this case. As shown in Figure 8, relative word performance was not degraded and sometimes even slightly better. In fact, from the last column of Figure 8 we see that even if our algorithm has access to only five annotated sequences when Juman has access to ten times as many, we still achieve better precision and better F measure. Both the local maximum and threshold conditions contribute. In our algorithm, a location k is deemed a word boundary if VN(k) is either (1) a local maximum or (2) at least as big as the threshold t. It is natural to ask whether we really need two conditions, or whether just one would suffice.","We therefore studied whether optimal performance could be achieved using only one of the conditions. Figure 9 shows that in fact both contribute to producing good segmentations. Indeed, in some cases, both are needed to achieve the best performance; also, each condition when used in isolation yields suboptimal performance with respect to some performance metrics. accuracy optimize optimize optimize","precision recall F-measure word M M & T M morpheme M & T T T Figure 9: Entries indicate whether best performance is achieved using the local maximum condition (M), the threshold condition (T), or both. 5 Related Work Japanese Many previously proposed segmentation methods for Japanese text make use of either a pre-existing lexicon (Yamron et al., 1993; Matsumoto and Nagao, 1994; Takeuchi and Matsumoto, 1995; Nagata, 1997; Fuchi and Takagi, 1998) or pre-segmented training data (Nagata, 1994; Papa: georgiou, 1994; Nagata, 1996a; Kashioka et al., 1998; Mori and Nagao, 1998). Other approaches bootstrap from an initial segmentation provided by a baseline algorithm such as Juman (Matsukawa et al., 1993; Yamamoto, 1996).","Unsupervised, non-lexicon-based methods for Japanese segmentation do exist, but they often have limited applicability. Both Tomokiyo and Ries (1997) and Teller and Batchelder (1994) explicitly avoid working with kanji charactes. Takeda and Fujisaki (1987) propose the short unit model, a type of Hidden Markov Model with linguisticallydetermined topology, to segment kanji compound words. However, their method does not handle three-character stem words or single-character stem words with affixes, both of which often occur in proper nouns. In our five test datasets, we found that 13.56% of the kanji sequences contain words that cannot be handled by the short unit model.","Nagao and Mori (1994) propose using the heuris-246 tic that high-frequency character n-grams may represent (portions of) new collocations and terms, but the results are not experimentally evaluated, nor is a general segmentation algorithm proposed. The work of Ito and Kohda (1995) similarly relies on high-frequency character n-grams, but again, is more concerned with using these frequent n-grams as pseudo-lexicon entries; a standard segmentation algorithm is then used on the basis of the induced lexicon. Our algorithm, on the hand, is fundamentally different in that it incorporates no explicit no-tion of word, but only \"sees\" locations between characters."]},{"title":"Chinese","paragraphs":["According to Sproat et al. (1996), most prior work in Chinese segmentation has exploited lexical knowledge bases; indeed, the authors assert that they were aware of only one previously published instance (the mutual-information method of Sproat and Shih (1990)) of a purely statistical approach. In a later paper, Palmer (1997) presents a transformation-based algorithm, which requires pre-segmented training data.","To our knowledge, the Chinese segmenter most similar to ours is that of Sun et al. (1998). They also avoid using a lexicon, determining whether a given location constitutes a word boundary in part by deciding whether the two characters on either side tend to occur together; also, they use thresholds and several types of local minima and maxima to make segmentation decisions. However, the statistics they use (mutual information and t-score) are more complex than the simple n-gram counts that we employ.","Our preliminary reimplementation of their method shows that it does not perform as well as the morphological analyzers on our datasets, although we do not want to draw definite conclusions because some aspects of Sun et al's method seem incomparable to ours. We do note, however, that their method incorporates numerical differences between statistics, whereas we only use indicator functions; for example, once we know that one trigram is more common than another, we do not take into account the difference between the two frequencies. We conjecture that using absolute differences may have an adverse effect on rare sequences. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we have presented a simple, mostly-unsupervised algorithm that segments Japanese sequences into words based on statistics drawn from a large unsegmented corpus. We evaluated performance on kanji with respect to several metrics, including the novel compatible brackets and all-compatible brackets rates, and found that our algorithm could yield performances rivaling that of lexicon-based morphological analyzers.","In future work, we plan to experiment on Japanese sentences with mixtures of character types, possibly in combination with morphological analyzers in order to balance the strengths and weaknesses of the two types of methods. Since our method does not use any Japanese-dependent heuristics, we also hope to test it on Chinese or other languages as well."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank Minoru Shindoh and Takashi Ando for reviewing the annotations, and the anonymous reviewers for their comments.
