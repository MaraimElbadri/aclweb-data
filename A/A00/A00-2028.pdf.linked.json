Our expectation is that the ability to predict problematic dialogues will allow the system's dialogue manager to modify its behavior to repair problems, and even perhaps, to prevent them. We train a problematic dialogue classifier using automatically-obtainable features that can identify problematic dialogues significantly better (23%) than the baseline. A classifier trained with only automatic features from the first exchange in the dialogue can predict problematic dialogues 7% more accurately than the baseline, and one trained with automatic features from the first two exchanges can perform 14% better than the baseline. 1 Introduction Spoken dialogue systems promise efficient and natural access to a large variety of information sources and services from any phone. Systems that support short utterances to select a particular function (through a statement such as \"Say credit card, collect or person-to-person\") are saving companies millions of dollars. Research prototypes exist for applications such as personal email and calendars, travel and restaurant information, and personal banking (Baggia et al., 1998; Walker et al., 1998; Seneff et al., 1995; Sanderman et al., 1998; Chu-Carroll and Carpenter, 1999)"]},{"title":"inter alia.","paragraphs":["Yet there are still many research challenges: current systems are limited in the interaction they support and brittle in many respects.

HMIHY answered calls from live customer traffic and successfully automated a large number of customer requests.

In addition to the TASKSUCCESS dialogues, there are several other call outcomes, to be described in detail below, which we consider problematic.","tThe phone numbers, card numbers, and pin numbers in the sample dialogues are artificial."]},{"title":"210","paragraphs":["This paper reports results from a set of experiments that test whether we can learn to automatically predict that a dialogue will be problematic on the basis of information the system has: (1) early on in the dialogue; and (2) in real time. We train an automatic classifer for predicting problematic dialogues from features that can be automatically extracted from the HMIHY corpus. The results show that we can learn to predict problematic dialogues using fully automatic features with an accuracy ranging from 72% to 87%, depending on how much of the dialogue the system has seen so far. Section 2 describes HMIHY and the dialogue corpus which the experiments are based on. Section 3 details the encoding of the dialogues and the methods used for utilizing the machine learning program RIPPER to train an automatic problematic dialogue predictor (Cohen, 1996). Section 4 presents the results and section 5 summarizes the paper and describes future work. 2 Experimental System and Data HMIHY is a spoken dialogue system based on the notion of call routing (Gorin et al., 1997; Chu-Carroll and Carpenter, 1999). In the HMIHY call routing system, services that the user can access are classified into 14 categories, plus a category called other for calls that cannot be automated and must be transferred to a human operator (Gorin et al., 1997). ~ Each category describes a different task, such as person-to-person dialing, or receiving credit for a misdialed number. The system determines which task the caller is requesting on the basis of its understanding of the cMler's response to the open-ended system greeting A T~ T, How May I Help You?. Once the task has been determined, the information needed for completing the caller's request is obtained using dialogue submodules that are specific for each task (Abella and Gorin, 1999).","In addition to the TASKSUCCESS dialogues in which HMIHY successfully automates the customer's call, illustrated in Figure 1, and the calls that are transferred to a human operator, there are three other possible outcomes for a call, all of which are problematic. The first category, which we call HANGUP, results from a customer's decision to hang up on the system. A sample HANGUP dialogue is in Figure 2. A caller may hang up because s/he is frustrated with the system; our goal is to learn from the corpus which system behaviors led to the caller's frustration.","The second problematic category (WIZARD), resuits from a human customer care agent's decision to take over the call from the system. Because HMIHY is experimental, each call was monitored by a human","2 One potential use of our results is to provide better rules for making the transfer decision. SI: AT&T How may I help you?

USER HANGS UP Figure 2: Sample HANGUP Dialogue agent serving as a wizard who could override the system. There were a number of agents who participated as wizards during the trial of HMIHY and each wizard was simply told to take over the call if s/he perceived problems with the system's performance. The wizard's decision was logged by the experimental setup, resulting in labelling the call as one that the wizard took over. s A dialogue where the wizard decided that the dialogue was problematic and took over the call is shown in Figure 3.

WIZARD STEPS IN Figure 3: Sample WIZARD Dialogue","The third problematic category, the TASKFAILURE dialogues, are cases where the system completed the call, but carried out a task that was not the task that the customer was actually requesting. An example TASKFAILURE dialogue is given in Figure 4: HMIHY interpreted utterance U2 as a request to make a third-party call e.g. to bill it to my home phone. HMIHY then asked the caller for the information it needed to carry out this task, the caller complied, and the system completed the call.","The corpus of 4774 dialogues used in our experiments was collected in severM experimental trials of HMIHY on live customer traffic (Pdccardi and Gorin, to appear; E.

In RIPPER, the classification model is learned using greedy search guided by an information gain metric, and is expressed as an ordered set of if-then rules.","To apply RIPPER, the dialogues in the corpus must be encoded in terms of a set of classes (the output classification) and a set of input features that are used as predictors for the classes. We start with the dialogue categories described above, but since our goal is to develop algorithms that predict/identify problematic dialogues, we treat HANGUP, WIZARD and TASKFAILURE as equivalently problematic. Thus we train the classifier to distinguish between two classes: TASKSUCCESS and PROBLEMATIC. Note that our categorization is inherently noisy because we do not know the real reasons why a caller hangs up or a wizard takes over the call. The caller may hang up because she is frustrated with the system, or she may simply dislike automation, or her child may have started crying. Similarly, one wizard may have low confidence in the system's ability to recover from errors and use a conservative approach that results in taking over many calls, while another wizard may be more willing to let the system try to recover. Nevertheless we take these human actions as a human labelling of these calls as problematic. Given this classification, approximately 36% of the calls in the corpus of 4774 dialogues are PROBLEMATIC and 64% are TASKSUCCESS.","Next, we encoded each dialogue in terms of a set of 196 features that were either automatically logged by one of the system modules, hand-labelled by humans, or derived from raw features.

The fact that the main focus of the rules is detecting ASR and NLU errors and that none of the DM behaviors are used as predictors also indicates that, in all likelihood, the DM is performing as well as it can, given the noisy input that it is getting from ASR and NLU.","To identify potential improvements in the problematic dialogue predictor, we analyzed which hand-labelled features made large performance improvements, under the assumption that future work can focus on developing automatic features that approximate the information provided by these hand-labelled features.

The rules that RIPPER learns for Exchanges 1&52 when the AUTOMATIC, TASK-INDEP feature set is augmented with the single hand-labelled rsuccess feature is shown below.","Exchanges 1~2, Rsuccess -b Automatic Task-Independent Features: ife2-salience-coverage ~ 0.651 A e2-asr-duration >_ 0.04 A e2-rsuccess=Rvacuous-match then problematic, if e2-rsuccess=Rmismatch A el-top-confidence < 0.909 then problematic, if e2-rsuccess=Rmismatch A e2-context-shift < 0.014 A e2-salience-coverage ~ 0.2 A e2-recog-numwords < 12 ( then problematic, if e2-rsuccess=Rmismatch ̂el-rsuccess=Rmismatch then"]},{"title":"problematic,","paragraphs":["if e2-rsuccess=Rmismatch A e2-top-confidence < 0.803 ̂e2-asr-duration >__ 2.68 ̂e2-asr-duration < 6.32 then problematic, if el-rsuccess=Rmismatch A el-diff-confidence > 0.83 then problematic, if e2-rsuccess=Rmismatch A e2-context-shift >_ 0.54 then problematic, ife2-asr-duration > 5.24 A e2-salience-coverage < 0.833 A e2-top-confidence < 0.801 A e2-recog-numwords < 7 A e2-asr-duration < 16.08 then problematic, if el-diff-confidence < 0.794 A el-asr-duration > 7.2 A el-inconsistency > 0.024 A el-inconsistency > 0.755 then problematic, default is tasksuccess","Note that the rsuccess feature is frequently used in the rules and that RIPPER learns rules that combine the rsuccess feature with other features, such as the confidence, asr-duration, and salience-coverage features."]},{"title":"5 Discussion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In summary, our results show that: (1) All feature sets significantly improve over the baseline; (2) Using automatic features from the whole dialogue, we can identify problematic dialogues 23% better than the baseline; (3) Just the first exchange provides sig-"]},{"title":"216","paragraphs":["nificantly better prediction (8%) than the baseline; (4) The second exchange provides an additional significant (7%) improvement, (5) A classifier based on task-independent automatic features performs with less than 1% degradation in error rate relative to the automatic features.

In future work we intend to use the (noisy) output from this classifier as input to our problematic dialogue classifier with the hope of improving the performance of the fully automatic feature sets. In addition, since it is more important to minimize errors in predicting PROBLEMATIC dialogues than errors in predicting TASKSUCCESS dialogues, we intend to experiment with RIPPER'S loss ratio parameter, which instructs RIPPER to achieve high accuracy for the PROBLEMATIC class, while potentially reducing overall accuracy. Finally, we plan to integrate the learned rulesets into the HMIHY dialogue system to improve the system's overall performance. References","A. Abella and A.L. Gorin. 1999.
