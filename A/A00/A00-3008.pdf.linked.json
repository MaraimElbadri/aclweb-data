Sarah.Oates@itri.brighton.ac.uk Abstract Most studies on discourse markers implicitly assume that only one marker or discourse relation will occur in a sentence. In reality, more than one relation may hold between text spans and may be cued by multiple discourse markers. We describe here a method for hierarchically organising discourse markers. The hierarchies are intended for use by a generation system to enable the selection and placement of more than one marker in a single text span. 1 Introduction The majority of studies on discourse markers implicitly assume that only one marker or discourse relation will occur in a sentence or that the presence of multiple markers will not affect the choice and placement of others. However, in reality, more than one relation may hold between text spans which may be cued by multiple markers. The available rules de-scribing the occurrence, choice and placement of a given marker do not account for multiple marker occurrence (Grote et al., 1995; Webber and Joshi, 1998; Power et al., 1999, e.g.,). We have found that the choice and placement of discourse markers is greatly affected, not only by the presence and number of other markers, but also by the style of the text and the strength of other markers in the text span. We describe here a method for hierarchically organising discourse markers which takes account of these factors. The hierarchies are intended for use by a generation system to enable the selection and placement of multiple markers. * The author would like to thank the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council for"]},{"title":"funding 2 Defining Discourse","paragraphs":["Markers Although precise definitions of discourse markers differ between studies, it is generally accepted that their role is to signal how one proposition should be interpreted given the other(s) in the discourse (Millis et al., 1995; Moore and Pollack, 1992). Most researchers in this field also agree that the relation between these propositions may exist regardless of whether a discourse marker is used (Scott and de Souza, 1990; Knott, 1995): a discourse marker is simply an explicit signal of a specific relation between two or more propositions. The non-occurrence of a marker does not mean that a discourse relation is absent:","(1) no marker, 1 relation: The museum does not intend to sponsor a particular aspect of modern art; it intends to make a report to the public by offering material for study and comparison.","By the same token, the presence of more than one discourse marker does not always signal a multitude of relations:","(2) P markers, 1 relation: The museum does not intend to sponsor a particular aspect of modern art, but rather to make a report to the public by offering material for study and comparison. (BNC) 1","Previous studies have accounted for a wide range of phenomena, from choosing between similar discourse markers (Fraser, 1998; Sanders et al., 1992) to abstracting away from discourse markers and using syntax to signal underlying discourse relations (Delin et al., 1996). However, the issue of multiple markers, like those in the example above, is only now beginning 1British National Corpus (Leech et al., 1994)"]},{"title":"41","paragraphs":["to be addressed. Recent work in computa-tional linguistics has provided possible solutions for the use of correlative markers (Webber and Joshi, 1998) and embedded clauses (Power et al., 1999). However, these solutions are incomplete and further research is needed if we are to account for all examples of multiple discourse markers. 3 Multiple Markers The present project focuses on all cases of multiple discourse markers, in other words, all cases where more than one marker occurs within two spans of text which are expressed either (a) within the same text sentence (Nunberg, 1990) covering one or more discourse relations (e.g., examples 3 and 4);","(3) Having said that, if you weigh only 60 kg (1321b) and yet still manage to sit your 90 kg (1981b) opponent down with a solid thump to his mid-section, then the refereeing panel may well applaud your fervour with a full point.

(BNC)","or (b) in different text sentences but covering only one relation, the so-called correlative markers (Quirk et al., 1985) (e.g., example 5):","(5) The job of being an Acorn Project leader is an unenviable one. For a start, they don't get paid, though they do receive a petrol allowance; for another thing, it's a bit like being in a group of unruly children for the week... (BNC)","The work described here focuses solely on multiple discourse markers cueing a single relation, paying attention, when possible, to embedded discourse relations and their markers. 4 Single Relations Multiple","Markers Preliminary tests using the British National Corpus (BNC) and Knott's (1995) taxonomy of discourse markers suggested that the order of multiple markers cueing a single relation is affected by their position in the taxonomy; those higher in the taxonomy always precede those lower in the taxonomy (see figure 1 and examples 6-7);","(6) This blood-line was particularly helpful to the early breeders because the line was in-bred, his parents being brother and sister of excellent breeding and so consequently true to type. (BNC)","(7) The difficulty is that the sites which have been extensively excavated, and so produced the largest quantities of pottery, such a Corbridge and Newstead, are multi-period, and the stratification of the excavations early in the century, consequently suspect. (BNC)","However, since Knott's taxonomy only allows us to view hierarchies of markers of a single relation, improvements were necessary in order to account for multiple markers. Using the BNC, a list of at least 350 English discourse markers and Mann and Thompson's (1988) original 23 rhetorical relations, we created a database on the number and type of relations each marker can cue (see figure 2). From this a hierarchy was built, similar to Knott's (1995), but benefiting from a wider range of markers and allow-ing more than one relation to be expressed at a time, thus reducing the redundancy present in Knott's taxonomy. Furthermore, in contrast to Knott's study in which examples were fabricated, all examples of discourse marker usage in our database are taken from the British National Corpus (BNC). Thus, all of our examples are taken from real, natural texts and are, therefore, representative of discourse marker occurrence in natural language. 5 Constructing the Hierarchy Our hierarchies are constructed on the assumption that (a) some discourse markers may be used to cue more than one relation and (b) when more than one marker is needed, the number of relations a marker can cue will affect the choice and position of that marker. In our hierarchy, those discourse markers which can cue many relations appear at the top and those mark-ing only a single relation occur at the bottom. Markers may also have additional constraints on their usage depending upon the text style, other relations being marked simultaneously and the content of the related propositions. 6 Strong ~ Weak Markers Figure 3 is an example of our hierarchy for the family of contrastive relations.

Figure 2: Extract from Database of Discourse Markers & Relations (contrast, antithesis, concession and exception) without constraint. When discourse markers can be used for a large number of relations, we refer to them as 'weak' markers since there is only a weak correlation between the marker and the relation being signalled. In contrast, when a discourse marker can only cue a single relation, we refer to it as a 'strong' marker, since there is a strong correlation between the relation and the explicit lexical cue. In the hierarchy 'notwithstanding that' is a highly constrained, strong discourse marker since it can only mark one relation (concession) and occur only when the text is formal, legal or both.","Our tests on the BNC show that the choice and placement of a marker will be affected by its strength or weakness; the weakest markers always precede the stronger ones.

Thus, working through the hierarchy from the weakest to the strongest markers, a generation system can de-termine which discourse marker should occur in a particular position on the basis that the weakest markers always precede the stronger ones. 44","paragraphs":["Decisions are based on the relation(s) to be marked, any other relation(s) already present, the style of the text, the content of the text spans, and the strength or weakness of other discourse markers present. 7 Conclusions Thus far, we have developed hierarchies for the family of contrastive relations in English and French and the family of causal relations in English. Ultimately, we intend to establish a complete hierarchy of all the markers of discourse relations; this will not only allow us to choose between different markers, regardless of whether one or more are used, but will also help to de-termine their order when multiple markers are necessary. In the final version of the hierarchy, we intend to provide the generation system with statistical information on the likelihood of one marker following another. Such information will take account of the fact that certain markers tend to occur together more often than others. These statistics are currently being de-rived from tests on the International Corpus of English (Nelson, 1995)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["J. Delin, D. R. Scott, and A. Hartley. 1996.
