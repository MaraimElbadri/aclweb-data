In contrast, several algorithms have been proposed in the literature that process the input in a bidirectional fashion; see (van Noord, 1997; Satta and Stock, 1994) and references therein. The issue of parsing efficiency for left-to-right vs. bidirectional methods has longly been debated. On the basis of experimental results, it has been argued that the choice of the most favourable strategy should depend on the grammar at hand. With respect to grammar formalisms based upon context-free grammars, and when the rules of these formalisms strongly depend on lexical information, (van Noord, 1997) shows that bidirectional strategies are more efficient than left-to-right strategies. This is because bidirectional strategies are most effective in reducing the parsing search space, by activating as early as possible the maximum number of lexical constraints available in the grammar.","In this paper we present mathematical arguments in support of the above empirically motivated the-sis. We investigate a class of lexicalized grammars that, in their probabilistic versions, have been widely adopted as language models in state-of-the-art real-world parsers. The size of these grammars usually grows with the square of the size of the working lexicon, and thus can be very large. In these cases, the primary goal in the design of a parsing algorithm is to achieve asymptotic time performance sublinear in the size of the working grammar and independent of the size of the lexicon. These desiderata are met by existing bidirectional algorithms (Alshawi, 1996; Eisner, 1997; Eisner and Satta, 1999). In contrast, we show the following two main results for the asymptotic time performance of left-to-right algorithms satisfying the so called correct-prefix property.","• In case off-line compilation of the working grammar is not allowed, left-to-right parsing cannot be realised within time bounds independent of the size of the lexicon.","• In case polynomial-time, off-line compilation of the working grammar is allowed, left-to-right parsing cannot be realised in polynomial time, and independently of the size of the lexicon, un-less a strong conjecture based on complexity results for the representation of regular languages is falsified. The first result implies that the well known Earley algorithm and related standard parsing techniques that do not require grammar precompilation cannot be directly extended to process the above mentioned grammars (resp. language models) within an acceptable time bound. The second result provides evidence that well known parsing techniques as left-corner parsing, requiring polynomial-time preprocessing of the grammar, also cannot be directly extended to process these formalisms within an acceptable time bound.","The grammar formalisms we investigate are based upon context-free grammars and are called bilexical context-free grammars. Bilexical context-free grammars have been presented in (Eisner and Satta, 1999) as an abstraction of language models that have been adopted in several recent real-world parsers, improving state-of-the-art parsing accuracy (A1shawl, 1996; Eisner, 1996; Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1997). Our results directly transfer to all these language models. In a bilexical context-free grammar, possible arguments of a word are always specified along with possible head words for those arguments. Therefore a bilexical grammar requires the grammar writer to make stipulations about the compatibil-"]},{"title":"272","paragraphs":["ity of particular pairs of words in particular roles, something that was not necessarily true of general context-free grammars.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We introduce bilexical context-free grammars in Section 2, and discuss parsing with the correct-prefix property in Section 3. Our results for parsing with on-line and off-line grammar compilation are presented in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. To complete the presentation, Appendix A shows that left-to-right parsing in time independent of the size of the lexicon is indeed possible when an off-line compilation of the working grammar is allowed that has an exponential time complexity."]},{"title":"2 Bilexical context-free grammars","paragraphs":["In this section we introduce the grammar formalism we investigate in this paper. This formalism, originally presented in (Eisner and Satta, 1999), is an abstraction of the language models adopted by several state-of-the-art real-world parsers (see Section 1). We specify a non-stochastic version of the formalism, noting that probabilities may be attached to the rewrite rules exactly as in stochastic CFG (Gonzales and Thomason, 1978; Wetherell, 1980). We assume that the reader is familiar with context-free grammars. Here we follow the notation of (Harrison, 1978; Hopcroft and Ullman, 1979).","A context-free grammar (CFG) is a tuple G = (VN, VT, P, S), where VN and VT are finite, disjoint sets of nonterminal and terminal symbols, respectively, S E VN is the start symbol, and P is a finite set of productions having the form A -+ a, where A E VN and a E (VN t3 VT)*. A \"derives\" relation, written ::~, is associated with a CFG as usual. We use the reflexive and transitive closure of =~, written =~*, and define L(G) accordingly. The size of a CFG G is defined as IGI ="]},{"title":"~(A--+a)EP","paragraphs":["]Aal. If every production in P has the form A --+ BC or A --+ a, for A,B,C E VN,a E VT, then G is said to be in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).","A CFG G = (VN, VT, P, S[$]) in CNF is called a bilexical context-free grammar if there exists a set VD, called the set of delexicalized nonterminals, such that nonterminals from VN are of the form A[a], consisting of A E VD and a E VT, and every production in P has one of the following two forms: (i) A[a] ~ B[b] C[c], a E {b, c); (ii) A[a] ~ a. A nonterminal A[a] is said to have terminal symbol a as its lexlcal head. Note that in a parse tree for G, the lexical head of a nonterminal is always \"in-herited\" from some daughter symbol (i.e., from some symbol in the right-hand side of a production). In the sequel, we also refer to the set VT as the lexicon of the grammar.","A bilexical CFG can encode lexically specific preferences in the form of binary relations on lexical items. For instance, one might specify P as to contain the production VP[solve] -+ V[solve] NP[puzzles] but not the production VP[eat] --4 V[eat] NP[puzzles]. This will allow derivation of some VP constituents such as \"solve two puzzles\", while forbidding \"eat two puzzles\". See (Eisner and Satta, 1999) for further discussion.","The cost of this expressiveness is a very large grammar. Indeed, we have IGI = O(]VD[ 3\" IVT[2), and in practical applications ]VTI >> IVDI > 1. Thus, the grammar size is dominated in its growth by the square of the size of the working lexicon. Even if we conveniently group lexical items with distributional similarities into the same category, in practical applications the resulting grammar might have several thousand productions. Parsing strategies that cannot work in sublinear time with respect to the size of the lexicon and with respect to the size of the whole input grammar are very inefficient in these cases. 3 Correct-prefix property So called left-to-right strategies are standa~dly adopted in algorithms for natural language parsing. Although intuitive, the notion of left-to-right parsing is a concept with no precise mathematical meaning. Note that in fact, in a pathological way, one could read the input string from left-to-right, storing it into some data structure, and then perform syntactic analysis with a non-left-to-right strategy. In this paper we focus on a precise definition of left-to-right parsing, known in the literature as correct-prefix property parsing (Sippu and Soisalon-Soininen, 1990). Several algorithms commonly used in natural language parsing satisfy this property, as for instance Earley's algor!thm (Earley, 1970), tabular left-corner and PLR parsing (Nederhof, 1994) and tabular LR parsing (Tomita, 1986).","Let VT be some alphabet. A generic string over VT is denoted as w = al \"-an, with n _> 0 and ai E VT (1 < i < n); in case n = 0, w equals the empty string e. For integers i and j with 1 < i < j < n, we write w[i,j] to denote string aiai+l\" .aj; if i > j, we define w[i, j] = c.","Let G -- (VN,VT,P,S) be a CFG and let w = al ... an with n _> 0 be some string over VT. A recognizer for the CFG class is an algorithm R that, on input (G,w), decides whether w E L(G). We say that R satisfies the correct-prefix property (CPP) if the following condition holds. Algorithm R processes the input string from left-to-right, \"consuming\" one symbol ai at a time. If for some i, 0 < i < n, the set of derivations in G having the form S ~* w[1, i]7, 7 E (VN U VT)*, is empty, then R rejects and halts, and it does so before consuming symbol ai+l, if i < n. In this case, we say that R"]},{"title":"273","paragraphs":["has detected an error at position i in w. Note that the above property forces the recognizer to do relevant computation for each terminal symbol that is consumed.","We say that w[1,i] is a correct-prefix for a language L if there exists a string z such that w[1,i]z E L. In the natural language parsing literature, the CPP is sometimes defined with the following condition in place of the above. If for some i, 0 < i < n, w[1, if is not a correct prefix for L(G), then R rejects and halts, and it does so before consuming symbol ai+i,~ if i < n. Note that the latter definition asks for a stronger condition, and the two definitions are equivalent only in case the input grammar G is reduced, i While the above mentioned parsing algorithms satisfy the former definition of CPP, they do not satisfy the latter. Actually, we are not aware of any practically used parsing algorithm that satisfies the latter definition of CPP.","One needs to distinguish CPP parsing from Some well known parsing algorithms in the literature that process symbols in the right-hand sides of each grammar production from left to right, but that do not exhibit any left-to-right dependency between different productions. In particular, processing of the right-hand side of some production may be initiated at some input position without consultation of productions or parts of productions that may have been found to cover parts of the input to the left of that position. These algorithms may also consult input symbols from left to right, but the processing that takes place to the right of some position i does not strictly depend on the processing that has taken place to the left of i. Examples are pure bottom-up methods, such as left-corner parsing without top-down filtering (Wiren, 1987).","Algorithms that do satisfy the CPP make use of some form of top-down prediction. Top-down prediction can be implemented at parse-time as in the case of Earley's algorithm by means of the \"predictor\" step, or can be precompiled, as in the case of left-corner parsing (Rosenkrantz and Lewis, 1970), by means of the left-corner relation, or as in the case of LR parsers (Sippu and Soisalon-Soininen, 1990), through the closure function used in the construction of LR states."]},{"title":"4 Recognition without precompilation","paragraphs":["In this section we consider recognition algorithms that do not require off-line compilation of the input grammar. Among algorithms that satisfy the CPP, the most popular example of a recognizer that does","i A context-free grammar G is reduced if every nonterminal of G can be part of at least one derivation that rewrites the start symbol into some string of terminal symbols. not require grammar precompilation is perhaps Earley's algorithm (Earley, 1970). We show here that methods in this family cannot be extended to work in time independent of the size of the lexicon, in contrast with bidirectional recognition algorithms.","The result presented below rests on the following, quite obvious, assumption. There exists a constant c, depending on the underlying computation model, such that in k > 0 elementary computation steps any recognizer can only read up to c. k productions from set P. In what follows, and without any loss of generality, we assume c = 1. Apart from this assumption, no other restriction is imposed on the representation of the input grammar or on the access to the elements of sets VN, VT and P. Theorem 1 Let f be any function of two variables defined on natural numbers.

Productions in (i) are called bridging productions. Note that there are q bridging productions in Gq. Also, note that V~ = {A,T} does not depend on the choice of q. Thus, we will simply write VD.","Choose q > max{f(IVD[,2),l }. On input (Gq, bq+2bq+i), R does not detect any error at position 1, that is after having read the first symbol bq+2 of the input string. This is because A[bl] ~* bq+2~/ with 3' =- T[ba+i]T[ba]T[bq-i]'\"T[bi] is a valid derivation in G. Since R executes no more than f(IVD] ,2) steps, from our assumption that reading a production takes unit time it follows that there must be an integer k, 1 < k < q, such that bridging production A[bk] --+ A[bk+i] T[bk] is not read from Gq. Construct then a new grammar GI~ by replacing in Gq the production A[bk] --+ A[bk+l] T[bk] with the new production A[bk] --+ T[bk] A[bk+i], leaving everything else unchanged. It follows that, on input (G~, ba+2ba+i), R behaves exactly as before and does not detect any error at position 1. But this is 274 a contradiction, since there is no derivation in G~ of the form A[bl] =~* bq+2\"Y, 7 E (VN U VT)*, as can be easily verified. •","We can use the above result in the comparison of left-to-right and bidirectional recognizers. The recognition of bilexical context-free languages can be carried out by existing bidirectional algorithms in time independent of the size of the lexicon and without any precompilation of the input bilexical grammar. For instance, the algorithms presented in (Eisner and Satta, 1999) allow recognition in time O(IVDI 3 IwI4). 2 Theorem 1 states that this time bound cannot be met if we require the CPP and if the input grammar is not precompiled. In the next section, we will consider the possibility that the input grammar is in a precompiled form. 5 Recognition with precompilation In this section we consider recognition algorithms that satisfy the CPP and allow off-line, polynomial-time compilation of the working grammar. We focus on a class of bilexical context-free grammars where recognition requires the stacking of a number of unresolved lexical dependencies that is proportional to the length of the input string. We provide evidence that the above class of recognizers perform much less efficiently for these grammars than existing bidirectional recognizers.","We assume that the reader is familiar with the notions of deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata. We follow here the notation in (Hopcroft and Ullman, 1979). A nondeterministic finite automaton (FA) is a tuple M = (Q, E, 5, q0, F), where Q and P. are finite, disjoint sets of state and alphabet symbols, respectively, qo E Q and F _C Q are the initial state and the set of final states, respectively, and is a total function mapping Q x ~ to 2 Q, the power-set of Q. Function 5 represents the transitions of the automaton. Given a string w = al \"\"an, n > O, an accepting computation in M for w is a sequence qo, al,ql,a2,q2 .... ,an,q,, such that qi E 5(qi-l,ai) for 1 <i < n, and q~ E F. The languageL(M) is the set of all strings in E* that admit at least one accepting computation in M. The size of M is defined as ]M] = ~qeQ,ae~ I~(q,a)l. The automaton M is deterministic if, for every q E Q and a E ~, we have IS(q, a)] = 1.","We call quasi-determinizer any algorithm A that satisfies the following two conditions:","1. A takes as input a nondeterministic FA M --= (Q, ~, 5, qo, F) and produces as output a device DM that, when given a string w as input, decides whether w E L(M); and","2More precisely, the running time for these algorithms is O(IVDI 3 Iw[3min{[VT[, [w[}). In cases of practical interest, we always have Iw[ < IVT[.","2. there exists a polynomial PA such that every DM runs in an amount of time bounded by PA(Iwl). We remark that, given a nondeterministic FA M specified as above, known algorithms allow simula-tion of M on an input string w in time O(IM I IwI) (see for instance (Aho et al., 1974, Thin. 9.5) or (Sippu and Soisalon-Soininen, 1988, Thm. 3.38)). In contrast, a quasi-determinizer produces a device that simulates M in an amount of time independent of the size of M itself.","A standard example of a quasi-determinizer is the so called power-set construction, used to convert a nondeterministic FA into a language-equivalent deterministic FA (see for instance (Hopcroft and Ullman, 1979, Thin. 2.1) or (Sippu and Soisalon-Soininen, 1988, Thm. 3.30)). In fact, there exist constants c and d such that any deterministic FA can be simulated on input string w in an amount of time bounded by c ]w I + d. This requires function to be stored as a IQ] x ]El, 2-dimensional array with values in Q. This is a standard representation for automata-like structures; see (Gusfield, 1997, :Sect. 6.5) for discussion.","We now pose the question of the time efficiency of a quasi-determinizer, and consider the amount of time needed in the construction of DM. In (Meyer and Fisher, 1971; Stearns and Hunt, 1981) it is shown that there exist (infinitely many) nondeterministic FAs with state set Q, such that any language-equivalent deterministic FA must have at least 2 IQ} states. This means that the power-set construction cannot work in polynomial time in the size of the input FA. Despite of much effort, no algorithm has been found, up to the authors' knowledge, that can simulate a nondeterministic FA on an input string w in linear time in' Iwl and independently of IMI, if only polynomial-time precompilation of M is allowed. Even in case we relax the linear-time restriction and consider recognition of w in polynomial time, for some fixed polynomial, it seems unlikely that the problem can be solved if only polynomial-time precompilation of M is allowed. Furthermore, if we consider precompilation of nondeterministic FAs into \"partially determinized\" FAs that would allow recognition in polynomial (or even exponential) time in Iw], it seems unlikely that the analysis required for this precompilation could consider less than exponentially many combinations of states that may be active at the same time for the original nondeterministic FA. Finally, although more powerful formalisms have been shown to represent some regular languages much more succinctly than FAs (Meyer and Fisher, 1971), while allowing polynomial-time parsing, it seem unlikely that this could hold for regular languages in general."]},{"title":"275 Conjecture","paragraphs":["There is no quasi-determinizer that works in polynomial time in the size of the input automaton.","Before turning to our main result, we need to develop some additional machinery.

To complete our presentation, we show here that correct-prefix property parsing in time independent of the lexicon size is indeed possible if we spend exponential time on grammar precompilation.","We first consider tabular LR parsing (Tomita, 1986), a technique which satisfies the correct-prefix property, and apply it to bilexical CFGs. Our presentation relies on definitions from (Nederhof and Satta, 1996). Let w E V~ be some input string. A property of LR parsing is that any state that can be reached after reading prefix w[1,j], j < ]w], must be of the form goto(goto(. . . (goto( q~n, X1),...), Xm-1), Xm) where q~ is the initial LR state, and XI,..., X,~ are terminals or nonterminals such that XI'.'Xm o* w[1, if. For a bilexical CFG, each X~ is of the form b~ or of the form B~[b~], where bl,..., bm is some subsequence of wIl,j ]. This means that there are at most (2+ IVDI)\" distinct states that can be reached by the recognizer, apart from qin. In the algorithm, the tabulation prevents repeated manipulation of states for a triple of input positions, leading to a time complexity of O(n 3 IvDIn), where n = Iwl. Hence, when we apply precompilation of the grammar, we can carry out recognition in time exponential in the length of the input string, yet independent of the lexicon size. Note however that the precompilation for LR parsing takes exponential time.","The second algorithm with the CPP we will consider can be derived from Earley's algorithm (Earley, 1970). For this new recognizer, we achieve a time complexity completely independent of the size of the whole grammar, not merely independent of the size of the lexicon as in the case of tabular LR parsing. Furthermore, the input grammar can be any general CFG, not necessarily a bilexical one. In terms of the length of the input, the complexity is polynomial rather than exponential.","Earley's algorithm is outlined in what follows, with minor modifications with respect to its original presentation.

After an initial item is added to entry T[0, 0] in the table, other items in other entries are derived from it, directly or indirectly, using three steps called predictor, scanner and completer. When no more new items can be derived, the presence of a final item in entry T[0, n] indicates whether the input is recognized.","The recognition process can be precompiled, based on the observation that for any grammar the set of all possible items is finite, and thereby all potential contents of T's entries can be enumerated.

More precisely, each set of items is represented by an atomic state, and combining two sets of items according to the completer step is implemented by indexing a 2-dimensional array by the two states representing those two sets, yielding a third state representing the resulting set of items. Similarly, the scanner and predictor steps and the union operation on sets of items can all be implemented by table lookup.","The time complexity of recognition can straightforwardly be shown to be (9(n3), independent of the size of the grammar. However, massive precompilation is involved in enumerating all possible sets of items and precomputing the operations on them. The motivation for discussing this algorithm is therefore purely theoretical: it illustrates the unfavourable complexity properties that Theorem 2, together with the conjecture about quasi-determinizers, attributes to the recognition problem if the correct-prefix property is to be ensured."]},{"title":"279","paragraphs":[]}],"references":[{"authors":[{"first":"A.","middle":"V.","last":"Aho"},{"first":"J.","middle":"E.","last":"Hopcroft"},{"first":"J.","middle":"D.","last":"Ullman"}],"year":"1974","title":"The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms","source":"A.
