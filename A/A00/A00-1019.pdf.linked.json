In constrast to classical IMT systems, where the user's role consists mainly of assisting the computer to analyse the source text (by answering questions about word sense, ellipses, phrasal attachments, etc), in TRANSTYPE the interaction is directly concerned with establishing the target text.","Our interactive translation system works as follows: a translator selects a sentence and begins typing its translation. After each character typed by the translator, the system displays a proposed completion, which may either be accepted using a special key or rejected by continuing to type. Thus the translator remains in control of the translation process and the machine must continually adapt its suggestions in response to his or her input. We are currently undertaking a study to measure the extent to which our word-completion prototype can improve translator productivity. The conclusions of this study will be presented elsewhere.","The first version of TrtANSTYPE (Foster et al., 1997) only proposed completions for the current word. This paper deals with predictions which extend to the next several words in the text. The potential gain from multiple-word predictions can be appreciated in the one-sentence translation task reported in table 1, where a hypothetical user saves over 60% of the keystrokes needed to produce a translation in a word completion scenario, and about 85% in a \"unit\" completion scenario.","In all the figures that follow, we use different fonts to differentiate the various input and output:"]},{"title":"italics","paragraphs":["are used for the source text, sans-serif for characters typed by the user and typewriter-like for characters completed by the system.","The first few lines of the table 1 give an idea of how TransType functions.

These studies report improvements on some specific tasks (task-oriented limited vocabulary) which by nature are very different from the task TRANSTYPE is devoted to. Furthermore, the underlying decoding strategies are too time consuming for our application• We therefore use a translation model based on the simple linear in-terpolation given in equation 2 which combines predictions of two translation models -- Ms and M~ -- both based on IBM-like model 2(Brown et al., 1993). Ms was trained on single words and Mu, described in section 3, was trained on both words and units. -- _ (2) word unit where Ps and Pu stand for the probabilities given respectively by Ms and M~. G(s) represents the new sequence of tokens obtained after grouping the tokens of s into units. The grouping operator G is illustrated in table 2 and is described in section 3. 2.2 The Generator The task of the generator is to identify units that match the current prefix typed by the user, and pick the best candidate according to the evaluator. Due to time considerations, the generator introduces a division of the target vocabulary into two parts: a small active component whose contents are always searched for a match to the current prefix, and a much larger passive part over (380,000 word form-s) which comes into play only when no candidates are found in the active vocabulary. The active part is computed dynamically when a new sentence is selected by the translator. It is composed of a few entities (tokens and units) that are likely to appear in the translation. It is a union of the best candidates provided by each model Ms and M~ over the set of all possible target tokens (resp. units) that have a non-null translation probability of being translated by any of the current source tokens (resp. units). Table 2 shows the 10 most likely tokens and units in the active vocabulary for an example source sentence. 136 that. is • what. the . prime, minister . said","• and. i • have. outlined• what. has. happened . since• then.. c' - est. ce-que, le- premier - ministre, a-dit.,.et.j', ai. r4sum4- ce. qui.s'- est-produit - depuis • ."]},{"title":"g(s)","paragraphs":["that is what • the prime minister said • , and i • have . outlined • what has happened • since then • .

G(s) is the sequence of source tokens recasted by the grouping operator G. A8 indicates the 10 best tokens according to the word model, Au the 10 best units according to the unit model. 3 Modeling Unit Associations Automatically identifying which source words or groups of words will give rise to which target words or groups of words is a fundamental problem which remains open. In this work, we decided to proceed in two steps: a) monolingually identifying groups of words that would be better handled as units in a given context, and b) mapping the resulting source and target units. To train our unit models, we used a segment of the Hansard corpus consisting of 15,377 pairs of sentences, totaling 278,127 english tokens (13,543 forms) and 292,865 french tokens (16,399 forms). 3.1 Finding Monolingual Units Finding relevant units in a text has been explored in many areas of natural language processing. Our approach relies on distributional and frequency statistics computed on each sequence of words found in a training corpus. For sake of efficiency, we used the suffix array technique to get a compact representa-tion of our training corpus. This method allows the efficient retrieval of arbitrary length n-grams (Nagao and Mori, 94; Haruno et al., 96; Ikehara et al., 96; Shimohata et al., 1997; Russell, 1998).","The literature abounds in measures that can help to decide whether words that co-occur are linguistically significant or not. In this work, the strength of association of a sequence of words w[ = wl,..., wn is computed by two measures: a likelihood-based one p(w'~) (where g is the likelihood ratio given in (Dunning, 93)) and an entropy-based one e(w'~) (Shimohata et al., 1997). Letting T stand for the training text and m a token:","p(w~) = argming(w~, uS1 ) (3) ie]l,n[ e(w'~) = 0.5x +k","~rnlw,~meT h ( Ireq(w'~ m) k Ir~q(wT) ]","Intuitively, the first measurement accounts for the fact that parts of a sequence of words that should be considered as a whole should not appear often by themselves. The second one reflects the fact that a salient unit should appear in various contexts (i.e. should have a high entropy score).","We implemented a cascade filtering strategy based on the likelihood score p, the frequency f, the length l and the entropy value e of the sequences. A first filter"]},{"title":"(.~\"1 (lmin, fmin, Pmin,","paragraphs":["emin)) removes any sequence s for which l(s) < lmin or p(s) < Pmin or e(s) < e,nin or f(s) < fmin. A second filter (~'2) removes sequences that are included in preferred ones. In terms of sequence reduction, apply-ing ~1 (2, 2, 5.0, 0.2) on the 81,974 English sequences of at least two tokens seen at least twice in our training corpus, less than 50% of them (39,093) were filtered: 17,063 (21%) were removed because of their low entropy value, 25,818 (31%) because of their low likelihood value. 3.2 Mapping Mapping the identified units (tokens or sequences) to their equivalents in the other language was achieved by training a new translation model (IBM 2) using the EM algorithm as described in (Brown et al., 1993). This required grouping the tokens in our training corpus into sequences, on the basis of the unit lexicons identified in the previous step (we will refer to the results of this grouping as the sequence-based corpus). To deal with overlapping possibilities, we used a dynamic programming scheme which optimized a criterion C given by equation 4 over a set S of all units collected for a given language plus all single words. G(w~) is obtained by returning the path that maximized B(n). We investigated several Ccriteria and we found C~--a length-based measurc to be the most satisfactory.

It is also possible to focus on non-compositional compounds, a key point in bilingual applications (Su et al., 1994; Melamed, 1997; Lin, 99). Another interesting approach is to restrict sequences to those that do not cross constituent boundary patterns (Wu, 1995; Furuse and Iida, 96). In this study, we filtered for potential sequences that are likely to be noun phrases, using simple regular expressions over the associated part-of-speech tags.

These sentences have been selected randomly among sentences that have not been used for the training. Around 18% of the source and target words are not known by the translation model.","The baseline models (line 1 and 2) are obtained without any unit model (i.e. /~ = 1 in equation 2). The first one is obtained with an IBM-like model 1 while the second is an IBM-like model 2. We observe that for the pair of languages we considered, model 2 improves the amount of saved keystrokes of almost 3% compared to model 1. Therefore we made use of alignment probabilities for the other models.","The three next blocks in table 4 show how the parameter estimation method affects performance. Training models under the C1 method gives the worst results. This results from the fact that the word-to-word probabilities trained on the sequence based corpus (predicted by Mu in equation 2) are less accurate than the ones learned from the token based corpus. The reason is simply that there are less occurrences of each token, especially if many units are identified by the grouping operator.","In methods C2 and C3, the unit model of equation 2 only makes predictions pu(tls ) when s is a source unit, thus lowering the noise compared to method £1. We also observe in these three blocks the influence of sequence filtering: the more we filter, the better the results. This holds true for all estimation methods tried. In the fifth block of table 4 we observe the positive influence of the NP-filtering, especially when using the third estimation method.","The best combination we found is reported in line 15. It outperforms the baseline by around 1.5%. This model has been obtained by retaining all sequences seen at least two times in the training corpus for which the likelihood test value was above 5 and the entropy score above 0.2 (5rl (2, 2, 5, 0.2)). In terms of the coverage of this unit model, it is interesting to note that among the 747 sentences of the test session, there were 228 for which the model did not propose any units at all. For 425 of the remaining sentences, the model proposed at least one helpful (good or partially good) unit. The active vocabulary for these sentences contained an average of around 2.5 good units per sentence, of which only half (495) were proposed during the session. The fact that this model outperforms others despite its relatively poor coverage (compared to the others) may be explained by the fact that it also removes part of the noise introduced by decoupling the identification of the salient units from the training procedure.
