Derrick Higgins Department of Linguistics University of Chicago Abstract","paragraphs":["Many corpora which are prime candidates for automatic error correction, such as the output of OCR software, and electronic texts incorporating markup tags, include information on which portions of the text are most likely to contain errors.","This paper describes how the error markup tag <?> is being incorporated in the spell-checking of an electronic version of Diderot's Encyclopddie, and evaluates whether the presence of this tag has significantly aided in correcting the errors which it marks. Although the usefulness of error tagging may vary from project to project, even as the precise way in which the tagging is done varies, error tagging does not necessarily confer any benefit in attempting to correct a given word. It may, of course, nevertheless be useful in marking errors to be fixed manually at a later stage of processing the text."]},{"title":"1 The Encyclopddie","paragraphs":["1.1 Project Overview The goal of this project is ultimately to detect and correct all errors in the electronic version of the 18th century French encyclopedia of Diderot and d'Alembert, a corpus of ca. 18 million words. This text is currently under development by the Project for American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language (ARTFL); a project overview and limited sample of searchable text from the Encyclopddie are available at: http ://humanities. uchicago, edu/ARTFL/pro j ect s/encyc/. Andreev et al. (1999) also provides a thorough summary of the goals and status of the project.","The electronic text was largely transcribed from the original, although parts of it were produced by optical character recognition on scanned images. Unfortunately, whether a section of text was transcribed or produced by OCR was not recorded at the time of data capture, so that the error correction strategy cannot be made sensitive to this parameter. Judging from a small hand-checked section of the text, the error rate is fairly low; about one word in 40 contains an error. It should also be added that the version of the text with which I am working has already been subjected to some corrective measures after the initial data capture stage. For example, common and easily identifiable mistakes such as the word enfant showing up as ensant were simply globally repaired throughout the text. (The original edition of the Encyclop~die made use of the sharp 's', which was often confused with an 'f' during data entry--cf. Figure 1.)","At present, my focus is on non-word error detection and correction, although use of word n-grams seems to be a fairly straightforward extension to allow for the kind of context-sensitivity in error correction which has been the focus of much recent work (cf. Golding and Roth (1999), Mays et al. (1991), Yarowsky (1995)).","The approach I am pursuing is an application of Bayesian statistics.

It is implemented as a confusion matrix, which associates a probability with each input/output character pair, representing the probability of the input character being replaced by the output character. These probabilities can be estimated from a large corpus tagged for errors, but since I do not have access to such a source for this project, I needed to train the matrix as described in Kernighan et al. (1990).","Cf. Jurafsky and Martin (1999) for an in-troduction to spelling correction using confusion matrices, and Kukich (1992) for a survey of different strategies in spelling correction. 1.2 Treatment of <?> A number of different SGML-style tags are currently used in the encoding of the"]},{"title":"Encyclopddie,","paragraphs":["ranging from form-related tags such as <i> (for italic text), to semantic markup tags such as <article>, to the error tag <?>, the treatment of which is the focus of this article. The data entry specification for the project prescribes the use of <?> in all cases in which the keyboard operator has any doubt as to the identity of a printed character, and also when symbols appear in the text which cannot be represented in the Latin-1 codepage (except for Greek text, which is handled by other means). Other instances of the <?> tag were produced as indications of mistakes in OCR output.","Some examples of the use of the error tag from the actual corpus include the following:","<?> <?>darts J'<?>i","ab<?>ci<?><?>es","d'autre<?>aladies for a Hebrew R for"]},{"title":"dans","paragraphs":["for"]},{"title":"J'ai","paragraphs":["for"]},{"title":"abscisses","paragraphs":["for"]},{"title":"d'autres maladies","paragraphs":["The first is a case where <?> was used to mark an untypeable character.

Finally, in the last row the error tag indicates the omission of multiple characters, and even a word boundary.","In fact, as Table 1 shows, words which include the error tag generally have error types which are more difficult to correct than average.

Since <?> so often occurred as a replacement for a single, missing character, however, I treated it as a character in the language model, but one with an extremely low probability, so that any suggested correction would have to get rid of it in order to appreciably increase the probability of the word.","In short, <?> is included in the confusion matrix as a character which may occur as the result of interference from the noisy channel, but is highly unlikely to appear independently in the language. This approach ignores the many cases of multiple errors in-dicated by the error tag, but these probably pose too difficult a problem for this stage of the project anyhow. The funding available for the project does not currently allow us to pursue the possibility of computer-aided error correction; rather, the program must correct as many errors as it can without human intervention. Toward this end, we are will-ing to sacrifice the ability to cope with more","1 Actually, it does have a mechanism for dealing with cases such as ab<?>ci<?><?>es, in which the error tag occurs multiple times, but stands for a single letter in each case. esoteric error types in order to improve the reliability of the system on other error types.","The actual performance of the spelling correction algorithm on words which include the error tag, while comparable to the performance on other words, is perhaps not as high as we might initially have hoped, given that they were already tagged as errors. Of the corrections suggested for words without <?>, 47% were accurate, while of the corrections suggested for words with <?>, 29% were accurate. 2 Actually, if we include cases in which the program correctly identified an error as \"unrecoverable\", and opted to make no change, the percentage for <?> suggestions rises to 71%.","It may seem that these numbers in fact undermine the thesis that the error tagging in the"]},{"title":"Encyclopddie","paragraphs":["was not useful in error correction. I.e., if the correction algorithm exhibits the correct behavior on 47% of untagged errors, and on 71% of tagged errors, it seems that the tags are helping out somewhat. Actually, this is not the case. First, we should not give the same weight to correct behavior on unrecoverable errors (which means giving up on correction) and correct behavior on other errors (which means actually finding the correct form). Second, the tagged errors are often simply 'worse' than untagged errors, so that even if the OCR or keyboard operator had made a guess at the correct form, they would have easily been identifiable as errors, and even errors of a certain type. For example, I maintain that the form ab<?>ci<?><?>es would have been no more difficult to correct had it occurred instead as abfciffes."]},{"title":"2 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In sum, the errors which are marked with the <?> tag in the electronic version of the","2I admit that these numbers may seem low, but bear in mind that the percentage reflects the accuracy of the"]},{"title":"first guess","paragraphs":["made by the system, since its operation is required to be entirely automatic.

While the error tag is a somewhat unique member of the tagset, in that it typically flags a subpart of a word, rather than a string of words, this should not be taken to mean that it is the only tag which could be employed in spelling correction. If nothing else, \"wider-scope\" markup tags can be helpful in determining when certain parts of the corpus should not be seen as representative of the language model, or should be seen as representative of a distinct language model.

Tags which are applied in such a way as to de-limit sections of text which are relevant to correction (such as names, equations, and foreign language text), will be of greater use than tags which represent a mixture of such classes. Error tagging in particular should be most useful if it does not conflate quite distinct things that may be \"wrong\" with a text, such as illegibility of the original, unrenderable symbols, and OCR inaccuracies. Such considerations are certainly relevant in the evaluation of emerging text encoding standards, such as the specification of the Text Encoding Initiative.
