Estimated dependencies of subordinate clauses successfully increase the precision of an existing statistical dependency analyzer. 1 Introduction In the Japanese language, since word order in a sentence is relatively free compared with European languages, dependency analysis has been shown to be practical and effective in both rule-based and stochastic approaches to syntactic analysis. In dependency analysis of a Japanese sentence, among various source of ambiguities in a sentence, dependency ambiguities of subordinate clauses are one of the most problematic ones, partly because word order in a sentence is relatively free. In general, dependency ambiguities of subordinate clauses cause scope ambiguities of subordinate clauses, which result in enormous number of syntactic ambiguities of other types of phrases such as noun phrases. 1","1In our preliminary corpus analysis using the stochastic dependency analyzer of Fujio and Matsumoto (1998), about 30% of the 210,000 sentences in EDR bracketed corpus (EDR, 1995) have dependency ambiguities of subordinate clauses, for which the precision of chunk (bunsetsu) level dependencies is about 85.3% and that of sentence level is about 25.4% (for best one) ~ 35.8% (for best five), while for the rest 70% of EDR bracketed corpus, the precision of chunk (bunsetsu) level dependencies is about 86.7% and that of sentence level is about 47.5% (for best one) ~ 60.2% (for best five). In addition to that, when assuming that those ambiguities of subordinate clause dependencies are initially resolved in some way, the chunk level precision increases to 90.4%, and the sentence level precision to 40.6% (for best one) ~ 67.7% (for best five). This result of our preliminary analysis 110","In the Japanese linguistics, a theory of Minami (1974) regarding scope embedding preference of subordinate clauses is well-known. Minami (1974) classifies Japanese subordinate clauses according to the breadths of their scopes and claim that subordinate clauses which inherently have narrower scopes are embedded within the scopes of subordinate clauses which inherently have broader scopes (details are in section 2). By manually analyzing several raw corpora, Minami (1974) classifies various types of Japanese subordinate clauses into three categories, which are totally ordered by the embedding relation of their scopes. In the Japanese computational linguistics community, Shirai et al. (1995) employed Minami (1974)'s theory on scope embedding preference of Japanese subordinate clauses and applied it to rule-based Japanese dependency analysis. However, in their approach, since categories of subordinate clauses are obtained by manually analyzing a small number of sentences, their coverage against a large corpus such as EDR bracketed corpus (EDR, 1995) is quite low. 2","In order to realize a broad coverage and high performance dependency analysis of Japanese sentences which exploits scope embedding preference of subordinate clauses, we propose a corpus-based and statistical alternative to the rule-based manual approach (section 3). 3 clearly shows that dependency ambiguities of subordinate clauses are among the most problematic source of syntactic ambiguities in a Japanese sentence.","2In our implementation, the coverage of the categories of Shirai et al. (1995) is only 30% for all the subordinate clauses included in the whole EDR corpus.","~Previous works on statistical dependency analysis in-clude Fujio and Matsumoto (1998) and Haruno et al. (1998) in Japanese analysis as well as Lafferty et al. (1992), Eisner (1996), and Collins (1996) in English analysis. In later sections, we discuss the advantages of our approach over several closely related previous works.","Table 1: Word Segmentation, POS tagging, and Bunsetsu Segmentation of A Japanese Sentence","Word Segmentation POS (+ conjugation form)","Tagging Bunsetsu Segmentation","Tenki ga yoi kara dekakeyou noun case- adjective predicate- verb","particle (base) conjunctive-particle (volitional) Tenki-ga yoi-kara dekakeyou (Chunking)","English Translation weather subject fine because let's go out","(Because the weather is fine, let's go out.)","First, we formalize the problem of deciding scope embedding preference as a classification problem, in which various types of linguistic information of each subordinate clause are encoded as features and used for deciding which one of given two subordinate clauses has a broader scope than the other. As in the case of Shirai et al. (1995), we formalize the problem of deciding dependency preference of subordinate clauses by utilizing the correlation of scope embedding preference and dependency preference of Japanese subordinate clauses. Then, as a statistical learning method, we employ the decision list learning method of Yarowsky (1994), where optimal combination of those features are selected and sorted in the form of decision rules, according to the strength of correlation between those features and the dependency preference of the two subordinate clauses. We evaluate the proposed method through the experiment on learning dependency preference of Japanese subordinate clauses from the EDR bracketed corpus (section 4). We show that the proposed method outperforms other related methods/models. We also evaluate the estimated dependencies of subordinate clauses in Fujio and Matsumoto (1998)'s framework of the statistical dependency analysis of a whole sentence, in which we successfully increase the precisions of both chunk level and sentence level dependencies thanks to the estimated dependencies of subordinate clauses.","2 Analyzing Dependencies between Japanese Subordinate Clauses based on Scope Embedding Preference 2.1 Dependency Analysis of A"]},{"title":"Japanese","paragraphs":["Sentence First, we overview dependency analysis of a Japanese sentence.

Then, dependency relations among those chunks are estimated, where most practical dependency analyzers for the Japanese language usually assume the following two constraints:","1. Every chunk (bunsetsu) except the last one modifies only one posterior chunk (bunsetsu).","2. No modification crosses to other modifications in a sentence.","Table 1 gives an example of word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and bunsetsu segmentation (chunking) of a Japanese sentence, where the verb and the adjective are tagged with their parts-of-speech as well as conjugation forms.

Figure 2: Definition of Japanese Subordinate Clause 2.2 Japanese Subordinate Clause The following gives the definition of what we call a \"Japanese subordinate clause\" throughout this paper. A clause in a sentence is represented as a sequence of chunks. Since the Japanese language is a head-final language, the clause head is the final chunk in the sequence. A grammatical definition of a Japanese subordinate clause is given in Figure 2. 6 For example, the Japanese sentence in Table 1 has one subordinate clause, whose scope is indicated as the shaded rectangle in Figure 1.","2.3 Scope Embedding Preference of Subordinate Clauses We introduce the concept of Minami (1974)'s classification of Japanese subordinate clauses by describing the more specific classification by Shirai et al. (1995). From 972 newspaper summary sentences, Shirai et al. (1995) manually extracted 54 clause final function words of Japanese subordinate clauses and classified them into the following three categories according to the embedding relation of their scopes.","Category A: Seven expressions representing simultaneous occurrences such as \"Verb1","SThis definition includes adnominal or noun phrase modifying clauses \"Clause1 (NP1)\" (in English, relative clauses \"(NP1) that Clause1\"). Since an adnominal clause does not modify any posterior subordinate clauses, but modifies a posterior noun phrase, we regard adnominal clauses only as modifees when considering dependencies between subordinate clauses. to-tomoni (Clause2)\" and \"Verbl nagara (Clause2)\".","Category B: 46 expressions representing cause and discontinuity such as \"Verb1 te (Clause2)\" (in English \"Verbl and (Clause2)\") and \"Verb1 node\" (in English \"because (subject) Verb1 ...,\").","Category C: One expression representing in-dependence, \"Verb1 ga\" (in English, \"although (subject) Verb1 ...,\"). The category A has the narrowest scope, while the category C has the broadest scope, i.e., Category A -4 Category B -4 Category C where the relation '-<~ denotes the embedding relation of scopes of subordinate clauses. Then, scope embedding preference of Japanese subordinate clauses can be stated as below:","Scope Embedding Preference of","Japanese Subordinate Clauses","1. A subordinate clause can be embedded within the scope of another subordinate clause which inherently has a scope of the same or a broader breadth.","2. A subordinate clause can not be embedded within the scope of another subordinate clause which inherently has a narrower scope.
