We present an approach to word prediction that is based on learning a representation for each word as a function of words and linguistics predicates in its context. This approach raises a few new questions that we address. First, in order to learn good word representations it is necessary to use an expressive representation of the context. We present a way that uses external knowledge to generate expressive context representations, along with a learning method capable of handling the large number of features generated this way that can, potentially, contribute to each prediction. Second, since the number of words \"competing\" for each prediction is large, there is a need to \"focus the attention\" on a smaller subset of these. We exhibit the contribution of a \"focus of attention\" mechanism to the performance of the word predictor.

In particular, we provide the learner with a rich set of features that combine the information available in the local context along with shallow parsing information. At the same time, we study a learning approach that is specifically tailored for problems in which the potential number of features is very large but only a fairly small number of them actually participates in the decision. Word prediction experiments that we perform show significant improvements in error rate relative to the use of the traditional, restricted, set of features. Background The most influential problem in motivating statistical learning application in NLP tasks is that of word selection in speech recognition (Jelinek, 1998).

Efforts in this directions consists of (1) directly adding syntactic information, as in (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998; Rosenfeld, 1996), and (2) indirectly adding syntactic and semantic information, via similarity models; in this case n-gram type features are used whenever possible, and when they cannot be used (due to data sparsity), additional information compiled into a similarity measure is used (Dagan et al., 1999). Nevertheless, the efforts in this direction so far have shown very insignificant improvements, if any (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998; Rosenfeld, 1996). We believe that the main reason for that is that incorporating information sources in NLP needs to be coupled with a learning approach that is suitable for it.","Studies have shown that both machine learning and probabilistic learning methods used in NLP make decisions using a linear decision surface over the feature space (Roth, 1998; Roth, 1999). In this view, the feature space consists of simple functions (e.g., n-grams) over the the original data so as to allow for expressive enough representations using a simple functional form (e.g., a linear function). This implies that the number of potential features that the learning stage needs to consider may be very large, and may grow rapidly when increasing the expressivity of the features. Therefore a feasible computational approach needs to be feature-efficient. It needs to tolerate a large number of potential features in the sense that the number of examples required for it to converge should depend mostly on the number features relevant to the decision, rather than on the number of potential features.","This paper addresses the two issues mentioned above. It presents a rich set of features that is constructed using information readily available in the sentence along with shallow parsing and dependency information. It then presents a learning approach that can use this expressive (and potentially large) intermediate representation and shows that it yields a significant improvement in word error rate for the task of word prediction.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we formalize the problem, discuss the information sources available to the learning system and how we use those to construct features. In section 3 we present the learning approach, based on the SNoW learning architecture. Section 4 presents our experimental study and results. In section 4.4 we discuss the issue of deciding on a set of candidate words for each decision. Section 5 concludes and discusses future work. 2 Information Sources and Features Our goal is to learn a representation for each word in terms of features which characterize the syntactic and semantic context in which the word tends to appear. Our features are defined as simple relations over a collection of predicates that capture (some of) the information available in a sentence. 2.1 Information Sources Definition 1 Let s =< wl,w2,...,wn > be a sentence in which wi is the i-th word. Let :£ be a collection of predicates over a sentence s. IS(s)) 1, the Information source(s) available for the sentence s is a representation ors as a list of predicates I E :r, XS(S) = {II(Wll , ...Wl,),-.., /~g(W~l , ..-Wk,)}. Ji is the arity of the predicate Ij. Example 2 Let s be the sentence < John, X, at, the, clock, to, see, what, time, it, is > Let ~={word, pos, subj-verb}, with the interpreta-tion that word is a unary predicate that returns the value of the word in its domain; pos is a unary predicate that returns the value of the pos of the word in its domain, in the context of the sentence; subj- verb is a binary predicate that returns the value of the two words in its domain if the second is a verb in the sentence and the first is its subject; it returns ¢ otherwise. Then,","IS(s) = {word(wl) = John, ..., word(w3) = at,..., word(wn) = is, pos(w4) = DET,..., s bj - verb(w , w2) = {John, x}...}. The IS representation of s consists only of the predicates with non-empty values. E.g., pos(w6) = modal is not part of the IS for the sentence above. subj - verb might not exist at all in the IS even if the predicate is available, e.g., in The ball was given to Mary.","Clearly the IS representation of s does not contain all the information available to a human reading s; it captures, however, all the input that is available to the computational process discussed in the rest of this paper. The predicates could be generated by any external mechanism, even a learned one. This issue is orthogonal to the current discussion. 2.2 Generating Features Our goal is to learn a representation for each word of interest. Most efficient learning methods known today and, in particular, those used in NLP, make use of a linear decision surface over their feature space (Roth, 1998; Roth, 1999). Therefore, in order to learn expressive representations one needs to compose complex features as a function of the information sources available. A linear function expressed directly in terms of those will not be expressive enough. We now define a language that allows","1We denote IS(s) as IS wherever it is obvious what the referred sentence we is, or whenever we want to indicate Information Source in general."]},{"title":"125","paragraphs":["one to define \"types\" of features 2 in terms of the information sources available to it.

Then"]},{"title":"fand(fl,","paragraphs":["f2)"]},{"title":"for(f1,","paragraphs":["f2) fnot(fl) are defined and given the usual semantic:"]},{"title":"liff:----h=l","paragraphs":["fand(fl, f2) = 0 otherwise","liff:=l orf2=l fob(f1, f2) = 0 otherwise","{ l~ffl=O fnot(fx) = 0 otherwise In order to learn with features generated using these definitions as input, it is important that features generated when applying the definitions on different ISs are given the same identification. In this pre-sentation we assume that the composition operator along with the appropriate IS element (e.g., Ex. 2, Ex. 9) are written explicitly as the identification of the features. Some of the subtleties in defining the output representation are addressed in (Cumby and Roth, 2000). 2.3 Structured Features So far we have presented features as relations over IS(s) and allowed for Boolean composition operators. In most cases more information than just a list of active predicates is available. We abstract this using the notion of a structural information source (SIS(s)) defined below. This allows richer class of feature types to be defined.","2We note that we do not define the features will be used in the learning process. These are going to be defined in a data driven way given the definitions discussed here and the input ISs. The importance of formally defining the \"types\" is due to the fact that some of these are quantified. Evaluating them on a given sentence might be computationally intractable and a formal definition would help to flesh out the difficulties and aid in designing the language (Cumby and Roth, 2000). 2.4 Structured Instances Definition 5 (Structural Information Source) Let s =< wl,w2, ...,Wn >. SIS(s)), the Structural Information source(s) available for the sentence s, is a tuple (s, E1,... ,Ek) of directed acyclic graphs with s as the set of vertices and Ei 's, a set of edges in s. Example 6 (Linear Structure) The simplest SIS is the one corresponding to the linear structure of the sentence. That is, SIS(s) = (s,E) where (wi, wj) E E iff the word wi occurs immediately before wj in the sentence (Figure 1 bottom left part). In a linear structure (s =< Wl,W2,...,Wn >,E), where E = {(wi,wi+l);i = 1, ...n- 1}, we define the chain c(wj, [l, r]) = {w,_,,..., wj,.., n s.","We can now define a new set of features that makes use of the structural information. Structural features are defined using the SIS. When defining a feature, the naming of nodes in s is done relative to a distinguished node, denoted wp, which we call the focus word of the feature. Regardless of the arity of the features we sometimes denote the feature f defined with respect to wp as f(wp). Definition 7 (Proximity) Let SIS(s) = (s, E) be the linear structure and let I E Z be a k-ary predicate with range R. Let Wp be a focus word and C = C(wp, [l, r]) the chain around it. Then, the proximity features for I with respect to the chain C are defined"]},{"title":"as: fc(l(w), a)","paragraphs":["= { 1 ifI(w) = a,a E R,w E C 0 otherwise"]},{"title":"(3)","paragraphs":["The second type of feature composition defined using the structure is a collocation operator. Definition 8 (Collocation) Let fl,...fk be feature definitions, col locc ( f l , f 2, . . . f k ) is a restricted conjunctive operator that is evaluated on a chain C of length k in a graph. Specifically, let C = {wj,, wj=, .. . , wjk } be a chain of length k in SIS(s). Then, the collocation feature for fl,.., fk with respect to the chain C is defined as collocc(fl, . . . , fk) = { 1 ifVi = 1,...k, fi(wj,) = 1 0 otherwise"]},{"title":"(4)","paragraphs":["The following example defines features that are used in the experiments described in Sec. 4. 126 Example 9 Let s be the sentence in Example 2. We define some of the features with respect to the linear structure of the sentence. The word X is used as the focus word and a chain [-10, 10] is defined with respect to it. The proximity features are defined with respect to the predicate word. We get, for example: fc(word) ---- John; fc(word) = at; fc(word) = clock.","Collocation features are defined with respect to a chain [-2, 2] centered at the focus word X. They are defined with respect to two basic features fl, f2 each of which can be either f(word, a) or f(pos, a). The resulting features include, for example: collocc(word, word)= {John- X}; collocc(word, word) = {X - at}; collocc(word, pos) = {at- DET}. 2.5 Non-Linear Structure So far we have described feature definitions which make use of the linear structure of the sentence and yield features which are not too different from standard features used in the literature e.g., n-grams with respect to pos or word can be defined as colloc for the appropriate chain. Consider now that we are given a general directed acyclic graph G = (s, E) on the the sentence s as its nodes. Given a distinguished focus word wp 6 s we can define a chain in the graph as we did above for the linear structure of the sentence. Since the definitions given above, Def. 7 and Def. 8, were given for chains they would apply for any chain in any graph. This generaliza-tion becomes interesting if we are given a graph that represents a more involved structure of the sentence.","Consider, for example the graph DG(s) in Figure 1. DG(s) described the dependency graph of the sentence s. An edge (wi,wj) in DG(s) represent a dependency between the two words. In our feature generation language we separate the information provided by the dependency grammar 3 to two parts. The structural information, provided in the left side of Figure 1, is used to generate SIS(s). The labels on the edges are used as predicates and are part of IS(s). Notice that some authors (Yuret, 1998; Berger and Printz, 1998) have used the structural information, but have not used the information given by the labels on the edges as we do.","The following example defines features that are used in the experiments described in Sec. 4. Example 10 Let s be the sentence in Figure 1 along with its IS that is defined using the predicates word, pos, sub j, obj, aux_vrb. A sub j-verb","3This information can be produced by a functional dependency grammar (FDG), which assigns each word a specific function, and then structures the sentence hierarchically based on it, as we do here (Tapanainen and Jrvinen, 1997), but can also be generated by an external rule-based parser or a learned one. feature, fsubj-verb, can be defined as a collocation over chains constructed with respect to the focus word join. Moreover, we can define fsubj-verb to be active also when there is an aux_vrb between the subj and verb, by defining it as a disjunction of two collocation features, the sub j-verb and the subj-aux_vrb-verb. Other features that we use are conjunctions of words that occur before the focus verb (here: join) along all the chains it occurs in (here: will, board, as) and collocations of obj and verb.","As a final comment on feature generation, we note that the language presented is used to define \"types\" of features. These are instantiated in a data driven way given input sentences. A large number of features is created in this way, most of which might not be relevant to the decision at hand; thus, this process needs to be followed by a learning process that can learn in the presence of these many features. 3 The Learning Approach Our experimental investigation is done using the SNo W learning system (Roth, 1998). Earlier versions of SNoW (Roth, 1998; Golding and Roth, 1999; Roth and Zelenko, 1998; Munoz et al., 1999) have been applied successfully to several natural language related tasks. Here we use SNo W for the task of word prediction; a representation is learned for each word of interest, and these compete at evaluation time to determine the prediction. 3.1 The SNOW Architecture The SNo W architecture is a sparse network of linear units over a common pre-defined or incrementally learned feature space. It is specifically tailored for learning in domains in which the potential number of features might be very large but only a small subset of them is actually relevant to the decision made.","Nodes in the input layer of the network represent simple relations on the input sentence and are being used as the input features. Target nodes represent words that are of interest; in the case studied here, each of the word candidates for prediction is represented as a target node. An input sentence, along with a designated word of interest in it, is mapped into a set of features which are active in it; this representation is presented to the input layer of SNoW and propagates to the target nodes. Target nodes are linked via weighted edges to (some of) the input features. Let At = {Q,... , i,~} be the set of features that are active in an example and are linked to the target node t. Then the linear unit corresponding to t is active iff","t E w i > Ot, iEAt","where w~ is the weight on the edge connecting the ith","feature to the target node t, and Ot is the threshold 127"]},{"title":"~ , Nov.29. will- board -~¢ Vi ~,~ t!e dire~a Pierr/e Ye~ars old l -~ non-executive 61 Pierre -*Vinken-.-, -~ 61 -*-years -'*old ~ -\" will -- ] 1⁄4join ---the -,-board -.- as--- a +non-executive I 1⁄4 director-.- 29. -=-Nov. ~. ,, Nov. 29. old","paragraphs":["aux_vrb obj"]},{"title":"~sub?\" willJ b°~rd corped~%~ det pcomp","paragraphs":["det.. a-.."]},{"title":"Vir~.n attr","paragraphs":["\"mocl"]},{"title":"tl~e director, Pier're years attr * non-eXecutive","paragraphs":["qnt"]},{"title":"6t Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29.","paragraphs":["Figure 1: A sentence with a linear and a dependency grammar structure for the target node t. In this way, SNo W provides a collection of word representations rather than just discriminators.","A given example is treated autonomously by each target subnetwork; an example labeled t may be treated as a positive example by the subnetwork for t and as a negative example by the rest of the target nodes. The learning policy is on-line and mistake-driven; several update rules can be used within SNOW. The most successful update rule is a variant of Littlestone's Winnow update rule (Littlestone, 1988), a multiplicative update rule that is tailored to the situation in which the set of input features is not known a priori, as in the infinite attribute model (Blum, 1992). This mechanism is implemented via the sparse architecture of SNOW. That is, (1) input features are allocated in a data driven way - an input node for the feature i is allocated only if the feature i was active in any input sentence and (2) a link (i.e., a non-zero weight) exists between a target node t and a feature i if and only if i was active in an example labeled t.","One of the important properties of the sparse architecture is that the complexity of processing an example depends only on the number of features active in it, na, and is independent of the total number of features, nt, observed over the life time of the system. This is important in domains in which the total number of features is very large, but only a small number of them is active in each example. 4 Experimental Study 4.1 Task definition The experiments were conducted with four goals in mind:","1. To compare mistake driven algorithms with naive Bayes, trigram with backoff and a simple maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) baseline.","2. To create a set of experiments which is comparable with similar experiments that were previously conducted by other researchers.","3. To build a baseline for two types of extensions of the simple use of linear features: (i) Non-Linear features (ii) Automatic focus of attention.","4. To evaluate word prediction as a simple language model.","We chose the verb prediction task which is similar to other word prediction tasks (e.g.,(Golding and Roth, 1999)) and, in particular, follows the paradigm in (Lee and Pereira, 1999; Dagan et al., 1999; Lee, 1999). There, a list of the confusion sets is constructed first, each consists of two different verbs. The verb vl is coupled with v2 provided that they occur equally likely in the corpus. In the test set, every occurrence of vl or v2 was replaced by a set {vl, v2} and the classification task was to predict the correct verb. For example, if a confusion set is created for the verbs \"make\" and \"sell\", then the data is altered as follows:","Once target subnetworks have been learned and the network is being evaluated, a decision support mechanism is employed, which selects the dominant active target node in the SNoW unit via a winner-take-all mechanism to produce a final prediction. SNoW is available publicly at http ://L2R. cs. uiuc. edu/- cogcomp, html.","make the paper --+ {make,sell} the paper sell sensitive data --~ {make,sell} sensitive data The evaluated predictor chooses which of the two verbs is more likely to occur in the current sentence.","In choosing the prediction task in this way, we make sure the task in difficult by choosing between 128 competing words that have the same prior probabilities and have the same part of speech. A further advantage of this paradigm is that in future experiments we may choose the candidate verbs so that they have the same sub-categorization, phonetic transcription, etc. in order to imitate the first phase of language modeling used in creating candidates for the prediction task. Moreover, the pretransformed data provides the correct answer so that (i) it is easy to generate training data; no supervision is required, and (ii) it is easy to evaluate the results assuming that the most appropriate word is provided in the original text.","Results are evaluated using word-error rate (WER). Namely, every time we predict the wrong word it is counted as a mistake. 4.2 Data We used the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) of the years 88-89. The size of our corpus is about 1,000,000 words. The corpus was divided into 80% training and 20% test. The training and the test data were processed by the FDG parser (Tapanainen and Jrvinen, 1997). Only verbs that occur at least 50 times in the corpus were chosen. This resulted in 278 verbs that we split into 139 confusion sets as above. After filtering the examples of verbs which were not in any of the sets we use 73, 184 training examples and 19,852 test examples. 4.3 Results 4.3.1 Features In order to test the advantages of different feature sets we conducted experiments using the following features sets:","1. Linear features: proximity of window size 4-10 words, conjunction of size 2 using window size 4-2. The conjunction combines words and parts of speech.","2. Linear + Non linear features: using the linear features defined in (1) along with non linear features that use the predicates sub j, obj, word, pos, the collocations subj-verb, verb-obj linked to the focus verb via the graph structure and conjunction of 2 linked words. The over all number of features we have generated for all 278 target verbs was around 400,000. In all tables below the NB columns represent results of the naive Bayes algorithm as implemented within SNoW and the SNoW column represents the results of the sparse Winnow algorithm within SNOW.","Table 1 summarizes the results of the experiments with the features sets (1), (2) above.

Furthermore, we train using only 73,184 examples while (Dagan et al., 1999) train using 587, 833 examples. Given our experience with our approach on other data sets we conjecture that we could have improved the results further had we used that many training examples. 4.4 Focus of attention SNoW is used in our experiments as a multi-class predictor - a representation is learned for each word in a given set and, at evaluation time, one of these is selected as the prediction.

We have argued that the success of this approach hinges on the combination of using a large set of expressive features along with a learning approach that can tolerate it and converges quickly despite the large dimensionality of the data. We believe that this approach would be useful for other disambiguation tasks in NLP.","We have also presented a preliminary study of a reduction in the confusion set size and its effects on the prediction performance. In future work we intend to study ways that determine the appropriate confusion set in a way to makes use of the current task properties.
