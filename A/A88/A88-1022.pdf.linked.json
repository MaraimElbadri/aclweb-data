It alms at producing by 1990 a relatively small multlllngual prototype MT system able to translate between all nine official Community languages a limited number of text types in a limited domain, with a lexicon of ca. 20000 entries per language.","The text types Eurotra alms to translate may be defined as typical administrative texts /memos, minutes of meetings, communications etc.) In the domain of IT.

On the other hand, we are committed to produce a working prototype MMT system by the end of the programme, whlch should serve as a basis for the development by industry of the next generation of MT systems. These facts, together wlth the previously mentioned size and decentrallzatlon of Eurotra, have determined the design of the system, be It the linguistic recta-language or the underlying software.","The Eurotra framework has been described in detail In previous papers {[t],[2],[i2]). Here we will only briefly summarize its distinctive characteristics.","The central problem in multlllngual, transfer-based MT derives from the fact that the number of transfer components of such a system grows geometrically with the number of languages covered (72 transfer components for 9 languages}. In order to be feasible at all, such a system requires that the transfer components be Kept small, in principle llmlted to the lexical component.

EUROTR£'S LINGUISTICS","The generators for the first small Implementation have been defined In such a way that they mirror traditional linguistic Ideas about analytical levels : morphology, surface syntax (Immediate constituents and syntactic functions), deep syntax and semantics. However, In order to offer a full treatment of all texts In our text type and domain without pre-edltXng, we also Included generators which cater for character normalIsatlon (in order for the dictionary to be Independent of typography) and text structure (e.g. lay-out, text format, figures, footnotes).","At present the linguistic specifications define 6 levels In the Eurotra analysis and synthesis modules : ETS ENT ENS ECS ERS IS Eurotra Text Structure) Eurotra Normallsed Text} Eurotra Morphological Structure} Eurotra Constituent Structure) Eurotra Relational Structure) Interface Structure)","Figures 3 and 4 show an ECS, respectively IS, representation for the sentence : \"The decision adopted by the Council on 25 April i983 was Implemented by the Member States In the course of i983\".","The ECS representation of Figure 3 Is reduced structurally through two steps.First It ls translated Into the relational representation ERS which Identifies syntactic functions, elevates determiners, auxiliaries and valency bound prepositions and rearranges the constituents Into a canonical order.","Then the relational representation Is translated Into the Interface structure IS whereby passive Is undone, empty elements are Inserted for oblxgtory arguments which are absent In the surface form and semantic Information Is added to the feature bundles.","Note that, although the IS representation Is fairly simple from a structural point of view It still allows for modifier attachment at different levels of embedding, and thus, the two TIME constituents are attached to their proper governors without the use of complicated featurlsed references.","All generators being described In the same formal language, the representations of text structure, normalXsed text and morphology are built by augmented CF rules, Just like the syntactic representations. 162 Det NP NP N V SBAR PP Prep NP N PP Prep NP N S Aux V VP PP Prep NP Prep NP N PP NP NP PP Det N Prep ,, NP NP","Date",",,","the decision adopted by council on 25 were implemented by Member In the course of /983 April States i983 Figure 3 : Example of an ECS representatlon i GOV AR6 i ARG 2 60V GOV ARG I TIME MOD GOV NOD","s : : Prep GOV ARG2 implement member state declslon(i} adopt council ( TIME Prep ,, GOV on 1982.04. 25 1983 In course Flgure 4 : Example of an IS representation /","The modular approach to linguistics, whereby text format, morphology, syntax and semantics are handled by separate generators, enhances the repairability and extenslblllty of the system.

Representations Including all feature information are much more complex and Impractical to read. for Instance, that changes of the ETS, ENT and EMS grammars may be made freely as long as they produce the output needed by ECS.","The sequence of representations related by T-rules spans the distance between the actual text and the Interface structure (IS} which Is the beginning and end point of transfer.","In order to simplify transfer, IS abstracts away from surface phenomena like Inflection, derivation, compounding, constituent structure etc. It contains semantically labelled arguments and modifiers related to a predicate, and the 163 transfer dictionaries, Ideally, Just relate lexlcal unlts of one IS to lexlcal units of another.","In some cases, though, this does not worE, because of, e.g., lexlcal holes like the German word \"Schlmmel\" (meaning \"white horse\"} which has no lexlcal correspondent in English, or different functions mapping onto one another as the English predicate \"liKe\" which maps onto a 6erman adverbial modifier \"gern\". In these cases explicit non-lexlcal T-rules must be written for transfer.","The purpose of the IS experimentation In Eurotra Is precisely to minimize the number of expllclt transfer T-rules and the entire modular design as it has been proposed In the linguistic specifications Is primarily geared towards an experimentation process aimed at making It possible to reach an optimal IS through multiple cycles of prototyplng. 4.

Furthermore, for a system which requires the T-rules to be compositional, the operational semantics of generators turned out to be too poor, causing a proliferation of complex T-rules.","For the Implementation worE, thls has caused some problems. For Instance, we couldn't Implement ETS, ENT and EMS In the first cycle because the prototype only allowed structure manipulation to happen at one level. This meant that we could not build text structure, morphological structure and syntactic structure Independently, they all had to be built by one generator, which then became very blg and difficult to manage.","Another problem was that the analytical strategy of elevating functional elements like articles and prepositions, which Is motivated by the needs of MMT rather than by linguistic considerations, could not easily be reversed, because building new nodes In synthesis to represent these elements Is addition of structural Information.","In consequence, we had to change the specifications of the virtual machlne In such a way that each generator had the power of completing a representational object according to Its own definition of well formed representation, thus alleviating the task of the translators.","The modifiability of our original framework was Invaluable In this redesign since It allowed us to keep the core concepts basically unchanged while extending the functlonallty and expressiveness of the formalism. 5. DHSIGN MODIFICATIONS TO THE PRAME~0RI","As reported above, the first Implementation showed that two factors were responsible for the heaviness of the translators (not to be confused with transfer) : the relatively simple operational semantics of the generators comblned with the requirement that the translators be compositional.","Rather than giving up compositionality, which guarantees a well defined relation between representations belonging to adjacent levels, we increased the power of the generators by modifying their operational semantics to Include a controlled form of addJtion of structural Information, rather than Just addition of feature Information. Translators were impoverished to the 164 point where they can now be defined by default almost everywhere by specifying correspondences between feature theories pertaining to adjacent generators. Special, exceptional cases of T-rules have still to be specified explicitly. .\"","In the modified framework, the representation output by a translator is completed by the target generator. For Instance, ECS will eventually expect as input from the preceding level, which Is EMS, a tree wlth the top node T(ext| branching Into CihapterL Se(cttons| and Piaragraphs|. The P nodes should then branch directly Into wordform nodes which dominate tree-structure representations of the morphological structure of each wordform. The ECS generator will then complete this tree by Inserting S nodes and nontermlnal categorlal nodes of the constituent structure representation of each sentence, resulting In a parse tree of the sentence.","From our original framework we retain the architecture, i.e. breaking up the monollngual components of the system Into a sequence of generators whlch are related by translators.
