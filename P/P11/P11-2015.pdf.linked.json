Most previous work to date relies on shallow lexico-syntactic patterns and metadata to automatically detect vandalism in Wikipedia. In this paper, we explore more linguistically motivated approaches to vandalism detection. In particular, we hypothesize that textual vandalism constitutes a unique genre where a group of people share a similar linguistic behavior. Experimental results suggest that (1) statistical models give evidence to unique language styles in vandalism, and that (2) deep syntactic patterns based on probabilistic context free grammars (PCFG) discriminate vandalism more effectively than shallow lexico-syntactic patterns based on n-grams."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Wikipedia, the “free encyclopedia” (Wikipedia, 2011), ranks among the top 200 most visited web-sites worldwide (Alexa, 2011). This editable encyclopedia has amassed over 15 million articles across hundreds of languages. The English language encyclopedia alone has over 3.5 million articles and receives over 1.25 million edits (and sometimes upwards of 3 million) daily (Wikipedia, 2010). But allowing anonymous edits is a double-edged sword; nearly 7% (Potthast, 2010) of edits are vandalism, i.e. revisions to articles that undermine the quality and veracity of the content. As Wikipedia continues to grow, it will become increasingly infeasible for Wikipedia users and administrators to manually police articles. This pressing issue has spawned recent research activities to understand and counteract vandalism (e.g., Geiger and Ribes (2010)). Much of previous work relies on hand-picked rules such as lexical cues (e.g., vulgar words) and metadata (e.g., anonymity, edit frequency) to automatically detect vandalism in Wikipedia (e.g., Potthast et al. (2008), West et al. (2010)). Although some recent work has started exploring the use of natural language processing, most work to date is based on shallow lexico-syntactic patterns (e.g., Wang and McKeown (2010), Chin et al. (2010), Adler et al. (2011)).","We explore more linguistically motivated approaches to detect vandalism in this paper. Our hypothesis is that textual vandalism constitutes a unique genre where a group of people share similar linguistic behavior. Some obvious hallmarks of this style include usage of obscenities, misspellings, and slang usage, but we aim to automatically uncover stylistic cues to effectively discriminate between vandalizing and normal text. Experimental results suggest that (1) statistical models give evidence to unique language styles in vandalism, and that (2) deep syntactic patterns based on probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) discriminate vandalism more effectively than shallow lexico-syntactic patterns based on n-grams."]},{"title":"2 Stylometric Features","paragraphs":["Stylometric features attempt to recognize patterns of style in text. These techniques have been traditionally applied to attribute authorship (Argamon et al. (2009), Stamatatos (2009)), opinion mining 83 (Panicheva et al., 2010), and forensic linguistics (Turell, 2010). For our purposes, we hypothesize that different stylistic features appear in regular and vandalizing edits. For regular edits, honest editors will strive to follow the stylistic guidelines set forth by Wikipedia (e.g. objectivity, neutrality and factuality). For edits that vandalize articles, these users may converge on common ways of vandalizing articles. 2.1 Language Models To differentiate between the styles of normal users and vandalizers, we employ language models to capture the stylistic differences between authentic and vandalizing revisions. We train two trigram language model (LM) with Good-Turing discounting and Katz backoff for smoothing of vandalizing edits (based on the text difference between the vandalizing and previous revision) and good edits (based on the text difference between the new and previous revision).","2.2 Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG) Models Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFG) capture deep syntactic regularities beyond shallow lexico-syntactic patterns. Raghavan et al. (2010) reported for the first time that PCFG models are effective in learning stylometric signature of authorship at deep syntactic levels. In this work, we explore the use of PCFG models for vandalism detection, by viewing the task as a genre detection problem, where a group of authors share similar linguistic behavior. We give a concise description of the use of PCFG models be-low, referring to Raghavan et al. (2010) for more de-tails.","(1) Given a training corpus D for vandalism detection and a generic PCFG parser Co trained on a manually tree-banked corpus such as WSJ or Brown, tree-bank each training document di ∈ D using the generic PCFG parser Co.","(2) Learn vandalism language by training a new PCFG parser Cvandal using only those tree-banked documents in D that correspond to vandalism. Likewise, learn regular Wikipedia language by training a new PCFG parser Cregular using only those tree-banked documents in D that correspond to regular Wikipedia edits.","(3) For each test document, compare the probability of the edit determined by Cvandal and Cregular, where the parser with the higher score determines the class of the edit. We use the PCFG implementation of Klein and Manning (2003)."]},{"title":"3 System Description","paragraphs":["Our system decides if an edit to an article is vandalism by training a classifier based on a set of features derived from many different aspects of the edit. For this task, we use an annotated corpus (Potthast et al., 2010) of Wikipedia edits where revisions are labeled as either vandalizing or non-vandalizing. This section will describe in brief the features used by our classifier, a more exhaustive description of our non-linguistically motivated features can be found in Harpalani et al. (2010). 3.1 Features Based on Metadata Our classifier takes into account metadata generated by the revision. We generate features based on author reputation by recording if the edit is submitted by an anonymous user or a registered user. If the author is registered, we record how long he has been registered, how many times he has previously vandalized Wikipedia, and how frequent he edits articles. We also take into account the comment left by an author. We generate features based on the characteristics of the articles revision history. This includes how many times the article has been previously vandalized, the last time it was edited, how many times it has been reverted and other related features. 3.2 Features Based on Lexical Cues Our classifier also employs a subset of features that rely on lexical cues. Simple strategies such as count-ing the number of vulgarities present in the revision are effective to capture obvious forms of vandalism. We measure the edit distance between the old and new revision, the number of repeated patterns, slang words, vulgarities and pronouns, the type of edit (in-sert, modification or delete) and other similar features. 84 Features P R F1 AUC Baseline 72.8 41.1 52.6 91.6 +LM 73.3 42.1 53.5 91.7 +PCFG 73.5 47.7 57.9 92.9 +LM+PCFG 73.2 47.3 57.5 93.0 Table 1: Results on naturally unbalanced test data 3.3 Features Based on Sentiment Wikipedia editors strive to maintain a neutral and objective voice in articles. Vandals, however, in-sert subjective and polar statements into articles. We build two classifiers based on the work of Pang and Lee (2004) to measure the polarity and objectivity of article edits. We train the classifier on how many positive and negative sentences were inserted as well as the overall change in the sentiment score from the previous version to the new revision and the number of inserted or deleted subjective sentences in the revision. 3.4 Features Based on Stylometric Measures We encode the output of the LM and PCFG in the following manner for training our classifier. We take the log-likelihood of the regular edit and vandalizing edit LMs. For our PCFG, we take the difference between the minimum log-likelihood score (i.e. the sentences with the minimum log-likelihood) of Cvandal and Cregular, the difference in the maximum log-likelihood score, the difference in the mean log-likelihood score, the difference in the standard deviation of the mean log-likelihood score and the difference in the sum of the log-likelihood scores. 3.5 Choice of Classifier We use Weka’s (Hall et al., 2009) implementation of LogitBoost (Friedman et al., 2000) to perform the classification task. We use Decision Stumps (Ai and Langley, 1992) as the base learner and run LogitBoost for 500 iterations. We also discretize the training data using the Multi-Level Discretization technique (Perner and Trautzsch, 1998)."]},{"title":"4 Experimental Results Data","paragraphs":["We use the 2010 PAN Wikipedia vandalism corpus Potthast et al.

This corpus comprises of 32452 edits on 28468 articles, with 2391 of the edits identified as vandalism by human annotators. The class distribution is highly skewed, as only 7% of edits corresponds to vandalism. Among the different types of vandalism (e.g. deletions, template changes), we focus only on those edits that inserted or modified text (17145 edits in total) since stylometric features are not relevant to deletes and template modifications. Note that in-sertions and modifications are the main source for vandalism.","We randomly separated 15000 edits for training of Cvandal and Cregular, and 17444 edits for testing, preserving the ratio of vandalism to non-vandalism revisions. We eliminated 7359 of the testing edits to remove revisions that were exclusively template modifications (e.g. inserting a link) and maintain the observed ratio of vandalism for a total of 10085 edits. For each edit in the test set, we compute the probability of each modified sentence for Cvandal and Cregular and generate the statistics for the features described in 3.4. We compare the performance of the language models and stylometric features against a baseline classifier that is trained on metadata, lexical and sentiment features using 10 fold stratified cross validation on the test set. Results Table 1 shows the experimental results. Because our dataset is highly skewed (97% corresponds to “not vandalism”), we report F-score and 85 One day rodrigo was in the school and he saw a girl and she love her now and they are happy to-gether So listen Im going to attack ur family with mighty powers.

She is best known for her role as Faith in the second season of the TV series “Cuts”. Table 3: Examples of vandalism detected by baseline+PCFG features. Baseline features alone could not detect these vandalism. Notice that several stylistic features present in these sentences are unlikely to appear in normal Wikipedia articles. AUC rather than accuracy.1","The baseline system, which includes a wide range of features that are shown to be highly effective in vandalism detection, achieves F-score 52.6%, and AUC 91.6%. The baseline features include all features introduced in Sec-tion 3.","Adding language model features to the baseline (denoted as +LM in Table 1) increases the F-score slightly (53.5%), while the AUC score is almost the same (91.7%). Adding PCFG based features to the baseline (denoted as +PCFG) brings the most substantial performance improvement: it increases recall substantially while also improving precision, achieving 57.9% F-score and 92.9% AUC. Combining both PCFG and language model based features (denoted as +LM+PCFG) only results in a slight improvement in AUC. From these results, we draw the following conclusions:","• There are indeed unique language styles in vandalism that can be detected with stylometric analysis.","• Rather unexpectedly, deep syntax oriented features based on PCFG bring a much more substantial improvement than language models that capture only shallow lexico-syntactic patterns. 1 A naive rule that always chooses the majority class (“not","vandalism”) will receive zero F-score.

Although massive pockets in Queens and Brooklyn have 20% or less people who speak English not so good. Table 4: Examples of vandalism that evaded both our baseline and baseline+PCFG classifier. Dry wit, for example, relies on context and may receive a good score from the parser trained on regular Wikipedia edits (Cregular). Feature Analysis Table 2 lists the information gain ranking of our features. Notice that several of our PCFG features are in the top ten most informative features. Language model based features were ranked very low in the list, hence we do not include them in the list. This finding will be potentially advantageous to many of the current anti-vandalism tools such as vulgarisms, which rely only on shallow lexico-syntactic patterns. Examples To provide more insight to the task, Table 3 shows several instances where the addition of the PCFG derived features detected vandalism that the baseline approach could not. Notice that the first example contains a lot of conjunctions that would be hard to characterize using shallow lexico-syntactic features. The second and third examples also show sentence structure that are more informal and vandalism-like. The fourth example is one that is harder to catch. It looks almost like a benign edit, however, what makes it a vandalism is the phrase “(Happy Birthday)” inserted in the middle.","Table 4 shows examples where all of our systems could not detect the vandalism correctly. Notice that examples in Table 4 generally manifest more a for-mal voice than those in Table 3."]},{"title":"5 Related Work","paragraphs":["Wang and McKeown (2010) present the first approach that is linguistically motivated. Their ap-86 proach was based on shallow syntactic patterns, while ours explores the use of deep syntactic patterns, and performs a comparative evaluation across different stylometry analysis techniques. It is worth-while to note that the approach of Wang and McKeown (2010) is not as practical and scalable as ours in that it requires crawling a substantial number (150) of webpages to detect each vandalism edit. From our pilot study based on 1600 edits (50% of which is vandalism), we found that the topic-specific language models built from web search do not produce stronger result than PCFG based features. We do not have a result directly comparable to theirs how-ever, as we could not crawl the necessary webpages required to match the size of corpus.","The standard approach to Wikipedia vandalism detection is to develop a feature based on either the content or metadata and train a classifier to recognize it. A comprehensive overview of what types of features have been employed for this task can be found in Potthast et al. (2010). WikiTrust, a reputation system for Wikipedia authors, focuses on de-termining the likely quality of a contribution (Adler and de Alfaro, 2007)."]},{"title":"6 Future Work and Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper presents a vandalism detection system for Wikipedia that uses stylometric features to aide in classification. We show that deep syntactic patterns based on PCFGs more effectively identify vandalism than shallow lexico-syntactic patterns based on n-grams or contextual language models. PCFGs do not require the laborious process of performing web searches to build context language models. Rather, PCFGs are able to detect differences in language styles between vandalizing edits and normal edits to Wikipedia articles. Employing stylometric features increases the baseline classification rate.","We are currently working to improve this technique through more effective training of our PCFG parser. We look to automate the expansion of the training set of vandalized revisions to include examples from outside of Wikipedia that reflect similar language styles. We also are investigating how we can better utilize the output of our PCFG parsers for classification."]},{"title":"7 Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We express our most sincere gratitude to Dr. Tamara Berg and Dr. Luis Ortiz for their valuable guidance and suggestions in applying Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to the task of vandalism detection.
