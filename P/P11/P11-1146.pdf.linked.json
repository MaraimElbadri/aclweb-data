Whereas during the last decade the field has seen syntactic parsers mature and achieve high performance, the progress in semantics has been more modest. Previous research has mostly focused on relations between particular kind of arguments, e.g., semantic roles, noun compounds. Notwithstanding their significance, they target a fairly narrow text semantics compared to the broad semantics encoded in text.","Consider the sentence in Figure 1. Semantic role labelers exclusively detect the relations indicated with solid arrows, which correspond to the sentence syntactic dependencies. On top of those roles, there are at least three more relations (discontinuous arrows) that encode semantics other than the verb-argument relations.","In this paper, we venture beyond semantic relation extraction from text and investigate techniques to compose them.

This scheme, informally used previously for combining HYPERNYM with other relations, has not been studied for arbitrary pairs of relations.","For example, it seems adequate to state the following: if x is PART-OF y and y is HYPERNYM of z, then x is PART-OF z. An inference using this rule can be obtained instantiating x, y and z with engine, car and convertible. Going a step further, we consider nonobvious inferences involving AGENT, PURPOSE and other semantic relations.","The novelties of this paper are twofold. First, an extended definition for semantic relations is proposed, including (1) semantic restrictions for their domains and ranges, and (2) semantic primitives.","Second, an algorithm for obtaining inference axioms is described. Axioms take as their premises chains of two relations and output a new relation linking the ends of the chain.

In general, they are defined by a textual definition accompanied by a few examples. For example, Chklovski and Pantel (2004) loosely define ENABLEMENT as a relation that holds between two verbs V1 and V2 when the pair can be glossed as V1 is accomplished by V2 and gives two examples: assess::review and accomplish::complete.","We find this widespread kind of definition weak and prone to confusion. Following (Helbig, 2005), we propose an extended definition for semantic relations, including semantic restrictions for its arguments. For example, AGENT(x, y) holds between an animate concrete object x and a situation y.","Moreover, we propose to characterize relations by semantic primitives. Primitives indicate whether a property holds between the arguments of a relation, e.g., the primitive temporal indicates if the first argument must happen before the second.","Besides having a better understanding of each relation, this extended definition allows us to identify possible and not possible combinations of relations, as well as to automatically determine the conclusion of composing a possible combination.","Formally, for a relation R(x, y), the extended definitions specifies: (a) DOMAIN(R) and RANGE(R) (i.e., semantic restrictions for x and y); and (b) PR (i.e., values for the primitives). The inverse relation R−1","can be obtained by switching domain and range, and defining PR−1 as depicted in Table 1. 2.1 Semantic Primitives Semantic primitives capture deep characteristics of relations. They are independently determinable for each relation and specify a property between an element of the domain and an element of the range of the relation being described (Huhns and Stephens, 1989). Primitives are fundamental, they cannot be explained using other primitives.","For each primitive, each relation takes a value from the set V = {+, −, 0}. ‘+’ indicates that the primitive holds, ‘−’ that it does not hold, and ‘0’ that it does not apply.

The new primitives are justified by the fact that we aim at composing relations capturing the semantics from natural language. Whatever the set of relations, it will describe the characteristics of events (who / what / where / when / why / how) and connections between them (e.g., CAUSE, CORRELATION). Time, space and volition also play an important role. The third column in Table 1 indicates the value of the primitive for the inverse relation: id. means it takes the same; op. the opposite. The opposite of − is +, the opposite of + is −, and the opposite of 0 is 0.","2.1.1 An Algebra for Composing Semantic Primitives The key to automatically obtain inference axioms is the ability to know the result of composing primitives.

Consistent(PR1, PR2 ) is a simple procedure that compares the values assigned to each primitive; two values are consistent unless they have different opposite values or any of them is ‘×’ (i.e., the composition is prohibited). 3.3 An Example: Agent and Purpose We present an example of applying the CSR algorithm by inspecting the potential axiom AGENT(x, y) ◦ PURPOSE−1","(y, z) → R","3(x, z), where x is the agent of y, and action y has as its purpose z.

It is out of the scope of this paper to explain in detail the semantics of each relation or their detection. Our goal is to obtain inference axioms and, taking for granted that annotation is available, evaluate their accuracy. The only requirement for the CSR algorithm is to define semantic relations using the extended definition (Table 4). To define domains and ranges, we use the ontology in Section 4.2. Values for the primitives are assigned manually. The meaning of each relations is as follows: • CAU(x, y) encodes a relation between two situa-","tions, where the existence of y is due to the pre-","vious existence of x, e.g., He [got]y a bad grade","because he [didn’t submit]x the project. • INT(x, y) links an animate concrete object and the","situations he wants to become true, e.g., [Mary]y","would like to [grow]x bonsais. • PRP(x, y) holds between a concept y and its main","goal x.

Each sub table must be indexed with the first and second premises as row and column respectively. The table on the left summarizes axioms R1 ◦ R2 → R3 and R2 ◦ R1 → R3, the one in the middle axiom R1−1","◦ R","2 → R3 and the one on the right","axiom R2 ◦ R1−1 → R","3. The CSR algorithm identifies several correct ax-","ioms and accurately marks as prohibited several","combinations that would lead to wrong inferences:","• For CAUSE, the inherent transitivity is detected (a ◦ a → a). Also, no relation is inferred between two different effects of the same cause (a−1","◦ a → :) and between two causes of the same effect (a ◦ a−1","→ :).","• The location and temporal information of concept y is inherited by its cause, intention, purpose, agent and manner (sub table on the left, f and g columns). 1460","• As expected, axioms involving SYNONYMY as one of their premises yield the other premise as their conclusion (all sub tables).","• The AGENT of y is inherited by its causes, purposes and manners (d row, sub table on the right).

For example, [I]","x printed the document to","[read]y and [learn]z the contents; INT−1","(I, read )","◦ CAU(read, learn) → INT−1","(I, learn).","It is important to note that domain and range restrictions are not sufficient to identify inference axioms; they only filter out pairs of not compatible relations. The algebra to compose primitives is used to detect prohibited combinations of relations based on semantic grounds and identify the conclusion of composing them. Without primitives, the cells in Table 5 would be either empty (marking the pair as not compatible) or would simply indicate that the pair has compatible domain and range (without identify-ing the conclusion).","Table 5 summarizes 136 unique pairs of premises (recall Ri ◦ Rj = (Rj −1","◦ R i","−1",")−1","). Domain and range restrictions mark 39 (28.7%) as not compatible. The algebra labels 12 pairs as prohibited (8.8%, [12.4% of the compatible pairs]) and is unable to find a conclusion 14 times (10.3%, [14.4%]). Finally, conclusions are found for 71 pairs (52.2%, [73.2%]). Since more than one conclusion might be detected for the same pair of premises, 78 inference axioms are ultimately identified. 4.2 Ontology In order to define domains and ranges, we use a simplified version of the ontology presented in (Helbig, 2005). We find enough to contemplate only seven base classes: ev, st, co, aco, ao, loc and tmp. Entities (ent) refer to any concept and are divided into situations (si), objects (o) and descriptors (des).","• Situations are anything that happens at a time and place and are divided into events (ev) and states (st). Events imply a change in the status of other entities (e.g., grow, conference); states do not (e.g., be standing, account for 10%).","• Objects can be either concrete (co, palpable, tangible, e.g., table, keyboard) or abstract (ao, intangible, product of human reasoning, e.g., disease, weight). Concrete objects can be further classified as animate (aco) if they have life, vigor or spirit (e.g. John, cat).","• Descriptors state properties about the local (loc, e.g., by the table, in the box) or temporal (tmp, e.g., yesterday, last month) context of an entity. This simplified ontology does not aim at defining","domains and ranges for any relation set; it is a sim-","plification to fit the eight relations we work with."]},{"title":"5 Evaluation","paragraphs":["An evaluation was performed to estimate the validity of the 78 axioms.

Researches have targeted particular relations (e.g., CAUSE (Chang and Choi, 2006; Bethard and Martin, 2008)), relations within noun phrases (Nulty, 2007), named entities (Hirano et al., 2007) or clauses (Szpakowicz et al., 1995). Competitions include (Litkowski, 2004; Carreras and Màrquez, 2005; Girju et al., 2007; Hendrickx et al., 2009).","Two recent efforts (Ruppenhofer et al., 2009; Gerber and Chai, 2010) are similar to CSR in their goal (i.e., extract meaning ignored by current semantic parsers), but completely differ in their means. Their merit relies on annotating and extracting semantic connections not originally contemplated (e.g., between concepts from two different sentences) using an already known and fixed relation set. Unlike CSR, they are dependent on the relation inventory, require annotation and do not reason or manipulate relations. In contrast to all the above references and the state of the art, the proposed framework obtains axioms that take as input semantic relations pro-1462 duced by others and output more relations: it adds an extra layer of semantics previously ignored.","Previous research has exploited the idea of using semantic primitives to define and classify semantic relations under the names of relation elements, deep structure, aspects and primitives. The first at-tempt on describing semantic relations using primitives was made by Chaffin and Herrmann (1987); they differentiate 31 relations using 30 relation elements clustered into five groups (intensional force, dimension, agreement, propositional and part-whole inclusion). Winston et al. (1987) introduce 3 relation elements (functional, homeomerous and separable) to distinguish six subtypes of PART-WHOLE. Cohen and Losielle (1988) use the notion of deep structure in contrast to the surface relation and utilizes two aspects (hierarchical and temporal). Huhns and Stephens (1989) consider a set of 10 primitives.","In theoretical linguistics, Wierzbicka (1996) in-troduced the notion of semantic primes to perform linguistic analysis. Dowty (2006) studies compositionality and identifies entailments associated with certain predicates and arguments (Dowty, 2001).","There has not been much work on composing relations in the field of computational linguistics. The term compositional semantics is used in conjunction with the principle of compositionality, i.e., the meaning of a complex expression is determined from the meanings of its parts, and the way in which those parts are combined. These approaches are usually formal and use a potentially infinite set of predicates to represent semantics. Ge and Mooney (2009) extracts semantic representations using syntactic structures while Copestake et al. (2001) develops algebras for semantic construction within grammars. Logic approaches include (Lakoff, 1970; Sánchez Valencia, 1991; MacCartney and Manning, 2009). Composition of Semantic Relations is complimentary to Compositional Semantics.","Previous research has manually extracted plausible inference axioms for WordNet relations (Harabagiu and Moldovan, 1998) and transformed chains of relations into theoretical axioms (Helbig, 2005). The CSR algorithm proposed here automatically obtains inference axioms.","Composing relations has been proposed before within knowledge bases. Cohen and Losielle (1988) combines a set of nine fairly specific relations (e.g., FOCUS-OF, PRODUCT-OF, SETTING-OF). The key to determine plausibility is the transitivity characteristic of the aspects: two relations shall not combine if they have contradictory values for any aspect. The first algebra to compose semantic primitives was proposed by Huhns and Stephens (1989). Their relations are not linguistically motivated and ten of them map to some sort of PART-WHOLE (e.g. PIECE-OF, SUBREGION-OF). Unlike (Cohen and Losielle, 1988; Huhns and Stephens, 1989), we use typical relations that encode the semantics of natural language, propose a method to automatically obtain the inverse of a relation and empirically test the validity of the axioms obtained."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions","paragraphs":["Going beyond current research, in this paper we investigate the composition of semantic relations. The proposed CSR algorithm obtains inference axioms that take as their input semantic relations and output a relation previously ignored. Regardless of the set of relations and annotation scheme, an additional layer of semantics is created on top of the already existing relations.","An extended definition for semantic relations is proposed, including restrictions on their domains and ranges as well as values for semantic primitives. Primitives indicate if a certain property holds between the arguments of a relation. An algebra for composing semantic primitives is defined, allowing to automatically determine the primitives values for the composition of any two relations.","The CSR algorithm makes use of the extended definition and algebra to discover inference axioms in an unsupervised manner. Its usefulness is shown using a set of eight common relations, obtaining 78 axioms. Empirical evaluation shows the axioms add 2.32% of relations in relative terms with an overall accuracy of 0.88, more than what state-of-the-art semantic parsers achieve.","The framework presented is completely independent of any particular set of relations. Even though different sets may call for different ontologies and primitives, we believe the model is generally applicable; the only requirement is to use the extended definition. This is a novel way of retrieving semantic relations in the field of computational linguistics. 1463"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Steven Bethard and James H. Martin. 2008.
