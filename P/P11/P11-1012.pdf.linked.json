Query weighting is a key step in ranking model adaptation. As the learning object of ranking algorithms is divided by query instances, we argue that it’s more reasonable to conduct importance weighting at query level than document level. We present two query weighting schemes. The first compresses the query into a query feature vector, which aggregates all document instances in the same query, and then conducts query weighting based on the query feature vector. This method can efficiently estimate query importance by compressing query data, but the potential risk is information loss resulted from the compression. The second measures the similarity between the source query and each target query, and then combines these fine-grained similarity values for its importance estimation. Adaptation experiments on LETOR3.0 data set demonstrate that query weighting significantly outperforms document instance weighting methods."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Learning to rank, which aims at ranking documents in terms of their relevance to user’s query, has been widely studied in machine learning and information retrieval communities (Herbrich et al., 2000; Freund et al., 2004; Burges et al., 2005; Yue et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2007; Liu, 2009). In general, large amount of training data need to be annotated by domain experts for achieving better ranking performance. In real applications, however, it is time consuming and expensive to annotate training data for each search domain. To alleviate the lack of training data in the target domain, many researchers have proposed to transfer ranking knowledge from the source domain with plenty of labeled data to the target domain where only a few or no labeled data is available, which is known as ranking model adaptation (Chen et al., 2008a; Chen et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2008b; Geng et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2009).","Intuitively, the more similar an source instance is to the target instances, it is expected to be more useful for cross-domain knowledge transfer. This motivated the popular domain adaptation solution based on instance weighting, which assigns larger weights to those transferable instances so that the model trained on the source domain can adapt more effectively to the target domain (Jiang and Zhai, 2007). Existing instance weighting schemes mainly focus on the adaptation problem for classification (Zadrozny, 2004; Huang et al., 2007; Jiang and Zhai, 2007; Sugiyama et al., 2008).","Although instance weighting scheme may be applied to documents for ranking model adaptation, the difference between classification and learning to rank should be highlighted to take careful consideration. Compared to classification, the learning object for ranking is essentially a query, which contains a list of document instances each with a relevance judgement. Recently, researchers proposed listwise ranking algorithms (Yue et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2007) to take the whole query as a learning object. The benchmark evaluation showed that list-112 Target domainSource Domain","d","1(s1)","d","2(s1) d 3(s1) d 1(s2) d 2(s2) d 3(s2) d 2(t1) d 1(t2) d 2(t2) d 3(t2) d 3(t1) d 1(t1) (a) Instance based weighting d 2(s1)d 1(s1) d 3(s1) d 1(s2) d 2(s2) d 3(s2) q s2 q s1 d 3(t1)d 2(t1)d 1(t1) d 1(t2) d 2(t2) d 3(t2) q t1 q t2 Target domainSource Domain (b) Query based weighting Figure 1: The information about which document instances belong to the same query is lost in document instance weighting scheme. To avoid losing this information, query weighting takes the query as a whole and directly measures its importance. wise approach significantly outperformed pointwise approach, which takes each document instance as independent learning object, as well as pairwise approach, which concentrates learning on the order of a pair of documents (Liu, 2009). Inspired by the principle of listwise approach, we hypothesize that the importance weighting for ranking model adaptation could be done better at query level rather than document level.","Figure 1 demonstrates the difference between instance weighting and query weighting, where there are two queries qs1 and qs2 in the source domain and qt1 and qt2 in the target domain, respectively, and each query has three retrieved documents. In Figure 1(a), source and target domains are represented as a bag of document instances. It is worth noting that the information about which document instances belong to the same query is lost. To avoid this information loss, query weighting scheme shown as Figure 1(b) directly measures importance weight at query level.","Instance weighting makes the importance estimation of document instances inaccurate when documents of the same source query are similar to the documents from different target queries. Take Figure 2 as a toy example, where the document instance is represented as a feature vector with four features. No matter what weighting schemes are used, it makes sense to assign high weights to source queries qs1 and qs2 because they are similar to target queries qt1 and qt2, respectively. Meanwhile, the source query qs3 should be weighted lower because","<d1s1 >=( 5, 1, 0 ,0 )","<d2s1 >=( 6, 2, 0 ,0 )","<d1s2 >=( 0, 0, 5, 1)","<d2s2 >=( 0, 0, 6, 2)","<d1s3 >=( 5, 1, 0, 0)","<d2s3 >=( 0, 0, 6, 2)","<d1t1 >=(5, 1, 0 ,0 )","<d2t1 >=(6, 2, 0 ,0 )","<d1t2 >=( 0, 0, 5, 1)","<d2t2 >=( 0, 0, 6, 2) qs1 qs2 qs3 qt1 qt2 Figure 2: A toy example showing the problem of document instance weighting scheme. it’s not quite similar to any of qt1 and qt2 at query level, meaning that the ranking knowledge from qs3 is different from that of qt1 and qt2 and thus less useful for the transfer to the target domain. Unfortunately, the three source queries qs1, qs2 and qs3 would be weighted equally by document instance weighting scheme. The reason is that all of their documents are similar to the two document instances in target domain despite the fact that the documents of qs3 correspond to their counterparts from different target queries.","Therefore, we should consider the source query as a whole and directly measure the query importance. However, it’s not trivial to directly estimate 113 a query’s weight because a query is essentially provided as a matrix where each row represents a vector of document features. In this work, we present two simple but very effective approaches attempting to resolve the problem from distinct perspectives: (1) we compress each query into a query feature vector by aggregating all of its document instances, and then conduct query weighting on these query feature vectors; (2) we measure the similarity between the source query and each target query one by one, and then combine these fine-grained similarity values to calculate its importance to the target domain."]},{"title":"2 Instance Weighting Scheme Review","paragraphs":["The basic idea of instance weighting is to put larger weights on source instances which are more similar to target domain. As a result, the key problem is how to accurately estimate the instance’s weight indicating its importance to target domain. (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) used a small number of labeled data from target domain to weight source instances. Recently, some researchers proposed to weight source instance only using unlabeled target instances (Shimodaira, 2000; Sugiyama et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2007; Zadrozny, 2004; Gao et al., 2010). In this work, we also focus on weighting source queries only using unlabeled target queries.","(Gao et al., 2010; Ben-David et al., 2010) proposed to use a classification hyperplane to separate source instances from target instances. With the domain separator, the probability that a source instance is classified to target domain can be used as the importance weight. Other instance weighting methods were proposed for the sample selection bias or covariate shift in the more general setting of classifier learning (Shimodaira, 2000; Sugiyama et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2007; Zadrozny, 2004). (Sugiyama et al., 2008) used a natural model selection procedure, referred to as Kullback-Leibler divergence Importance Estimation Procedure (KLIEP), for automatically tuning parameters, and showed that its importance estimation was more accurate. The main idea is to directly estimate the density function ratio of target distribution pt(x) to source distribution ps(x), i.e. w(x) =","pt(x)","ps(x) . Then model w(x) can be used to","estimate the importance of source instances. Model","parameters were computed with a linear model by minimizing the KL-divergence from pt(x) to its estimator p̂t(x). Since p̂t(x) = ŵ(x)ps(x), the ultimate objective only contains model ŵ(x).","For using instance weighting in pairwise ranking algorithms, the weights of document instances should be transformed into those of document pairs (Gao et al., 2010). Given a pair of documents ⟨xi, xj⟩ and their weights wi and wj, the pairwise weight wij could be estimated probabilistically as wi ∗ wj. To consider query factor, query weight was further estimated as the average value of the weights over all the pairs, i.e., wq = 1","M","∑","i,j wij, where M is the number of pairs in query q. Additionally, to take the advantage of both query and document information, a probabilistic weighting for ⟨xi, xj⟩ was modeled by wq ∗ wij. Through the transformation, instance weighting schemes for classification can be applied to ranking model adaptation."]},{"title":"3 Query Weighting","paragraphs":["In this section, we extend instance weighting to directly estimate query importance for more effective ranking model adaptation. We present two query weighting methods from different perspectives. Note that although our methods are based on domain separator scheme, other instance weighting schemes such as KLIEP (Sugiyama et al., 2008) can also be extended similarly.","3.1 Query Weighting by Document Feature Aggregation Our first query weighting method is inspired by the recent work on local learning for ranking (Geng et al., 2008; Banerjee et al., 2009). The query can be compressed into a query feature vector, where each feature value is obtained by the aggregate of its corresponding features of all documents in the query.

For example, the merit of features in some influential documents may be canceled out in the mean-variance calculation, resulting in many distorted feature values in the query feature vector that hurts the accuracy of query classification hyperplane. This urges us to propose another query weighting method from a different perspective of query similarity.","Intuitively, the importance of a source query to the target domain is determined by its overall similarity to every target query. Based on this intuition, we leverage domain separator to measure the similarity between a source query and each one of the target queries, where an individual domain separator is created for each pair of queries.

Note that query weights can be integrated with either pairwise or listwise algorithms. For pairwise algorithms, a straightforward way is to assign the query weight to all the document pairs associated with this query. However, document instance weighting cannot be appropriately utilized in listwise approach. In order to compare query weighting with document instance weighting, we need to fairly apply them for the same approach of ranking. Therefore, we choose pairwise approach to incorporate query weighting.

Originally, different query tasks were defined on different parts of data in the collection, which can be considered as different domains for us. Adaptation takes place when ranking tasks are performed by using the models trained on the domains in which they were originally defined to rank the documents in other domains. Our goal is to demonstrate that query weighting can be more effective than the state-of-the-art document instance weighting. 5.1 Datasets and Setup Three query tasks were defined in TREC-2003 and TREC-2004 web track, which are home page finding (HP), named page finding (NP) and topic distilla-tion (TD) (Voorhees, 2003; Voorhees, 2004). In this dataset, each document instance is represented by 64 features, including low-level features such as term frequency, inverse document frequency and document length, and high-level features such as BM25, language-modeling, PageRank and HITS. The number of queries of each task is given in Table 1.","The baseline ranking model is an RSVM directly trained on the source domain without using any weighting methods, denoted as no-weight. We implemented two weighting measures based on domain separator and Kullback-Leibler divergence, referred to DS and KL, respectively. In DS measure, three document instance weighting methods based on probability principle (Gao et al., 2010) were implemented for comparison, denoted as doc-pair, doc-avg and doc-comb (see Section 2).

Our proposed query weighting methods are denoted by query-aggr and query-comp, corresponding to document feature aggregation in query and query comparison across domains, respectively. All ranking models above were trained only on source domain training data and the labeled data of target domain was just used for testing.","For training the models efficiently, we implemented RSVM with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2007). The reported performance is obtained by five-fold cross validation. 5.2 Experimental Results The task of HP and NP are more similar to each other whereas HP/NP is rather different from TD (Voorhees, 2003; Voorhees, 2004). Thus, we carried out HP/NP to TD and TD to HP/NP ranking adaptation tasks. Mean Average Precision (MAP) (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999) is used as the ranking performance measure. 5.2.1 Adaptation from HP/NP to TD","The first set of experiments performed adaptation from HP to TD and NP to TD. The results of MAP are shown in Table 2.","For the DS-based measure, as shown in the table, query-aggr works mostly better than no-weight,doc-pair, doc-avg and doc-comb, and query-comp performs the best among the five weighting methods.

The reason is that although document feature aggregation might be a reasonable representation for a set of document instances, it is possible that some information could be lost or distorted in the process of compression. By contrast, more accurate query weights can be achieved by the more fine-grained similarity measure between the source query and all target queries in algorithm 2.","For the KL-based measure, similar observation can be obtained. However, it’s obvious that DS-based models can work better than the KL-based. The reason is that KL conducts weighting by density function ratio which is sensitive to the data scale. Specifically, after document feature aggregation, the number of query feature vectors in all adaptation tasks is no more than 150 in source and target domains. It renders the density estimation in query-aggr is very inaccurate since the set of samples is too small. As each query contains 1000 documents, they seemed to provide query-comp enough samples for achieving reasonable estimation of the density functions in both domains. 5.2.2 Adaptation from TD to HP/NP","To further validate the effectiveness of query weighting, we also conducted adaptation from TD to HP and TD to NP . MAP results with significant test are shown in Table 3.","We can see that document instance weighting schemes including doc-pair, doc-avg and doc-comb can not outperform no-weight based on MAP measure. The reason is that each query in TD has 1000 retrieved documents in which 10-15 documents are relevant whereas each query in HP or NP only consists 1-2 relevant documents. Thus, when TD serves as the source domain, it leads to the problem that too many document pairs were generated for training the RSVM model. In this case, a small number of documents that were weighted inaccurately can make significant impact on many number of document pairs. Since query weighting method directly estimates the query importance instead of document instance importance, both query-aggr and query-comp can avoid such kind of negative influence that is inevitable in the three document instance weighting methods. 5.2.3 The Analysis on Source Query Weights","An interesting problem is which queries in the source domain are assigned high weights and why it’s the case. Query weighting assigns each source query with a weight value. Note that it’s not meaningful to directly compare absolute weight values between query-aggr and query-comp because source query weights from distinct weighting methods have different range and scale. However, it is feasible to compare the weights with the same weighting method. Intuitively, if the ranking model learned from a source query can work well in target domain, it should get high weight.

Then, the source queries are ranked according to the MAP values obtained by their corresponding ranking models. The order is denoted as Rmap. Meanwhile, the source queries are also ranked with respect to their weights estimated by DS-based measure, and the order is denoted as Rweight. We hope Rweight is correlated as positively as possible with Rmap.

With-out the loss of generality, we reported the weighting time of doc-pair, query-aggr and query-comp from adaptation from TD to HP using DS measure. As doc-avg and doc-comb are derived from doc-pair, their efficiency is equivalent to doc-pair.","As shown in table 6, query-aggr can efficiently weight query using query feature vector. The reason is two-fold: one is the operation of query document aggregation can be done very fast, and the other is there are 1000 documents in each query of TD or HP, which means that the compression ratio is 1000:1. Thus, the domain separator can be found quickly. In addition, query-comp is more efficient than doc-pair because doc-pair needs too much time to find the separator using all instances from source and target domain. And query-comp uses a divide-and-conquer method to measure the similarity of source query to each target query, and then efficiently combine these 119 Weighting method HP03 to TD03 HP04 to TD04 NP03 to TD03 NP04 to TD04 query-aggr 0.0906 0.0280 0.0247 0.0525 query-comp 0.1001 0.0804 0.0711 0.1737 query-rand 0.0041 0.0008 -0.0127 0.0163 Table 4: The Kendall’s τ of Rweight and Rmap in HP/NP to TD adaptation.

(Blitzer et al., 2006) proposed model adaptation using pivot features to build structural feature correspondence in two domains. (Pan et al., 2009) proposed to seek a common features space to reduce the distribution difference between the source and target domain. (Daumé III and Marcu, 2006) assumed training instances were generated from source domain, target domain and cross-domain distributions, and estimated the parameter for the mixture distribution.","Recently, domain adaptation in learning to rank received more and more attentions due to the lack of training data in new search domains. Existing ranking adaptation approaches can be grouped into feature-based (Geng et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2008b; Wang et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2009) and instance-based (Chen et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2008a; Gao et al., 2010) approaches. In (Geng et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2008b), the parameters of ranking model trained on the source domain was adjusted with the small set of labeled data in the target domain. (Wang et al., 2009) aimed at ranking adaptation in heterogeneous domains. (Gao et al., 2009) learned ranking models on the source and target domains independently, and then constructed a stronger model by interpolating the two models. (Chen et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2008a) weighted source instances by using small amount of labeled data in the target domain. (Gao et al., 2010) studied instance weighting based on domain separator for learning to rank by only using training data from source domain. In this work, we propose to directly measure the query importance instead of document instance importance by consider-ing information at both levels."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We introduced two simple yet effective query weighting methods for ranking model adaptation. The first represents a set of document instances within the same query as a query feature vector, and then directly measure the source query importance to the target domain. The second measures the similarity between a source query and each target query, and then combine the fine-grained similarity values to estimate its importance to target domain. We evaluated our approaches on LETOR3.0 dataset for ranking adaptation and found that: (1) the first method efficiently estimate query weights, and can outperform the document instance weighting but some information is lost during the aggregation; (2) the second method consistently and significantly outperforms document instance weighting."]},{"title":"8 Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["P.
