In this paper, we propose synchronous adaptor grammar, a novel nonparametric Bayesian learning approach, for machine transliteration.

They are often translated through transliteration, i.e. translation by preserving how words sound in both languages. In general, machine transliteration is often modelled as monotonic machine translation (Rama and Gali, 2009; Finch and Sumita, 2009; Finch and Sumita, 2010), the joint source-channel models (Li et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2009), or the sequential label-ing problems (Reddy and Waxmonsky, 2009; Abdul Hamid and Darwish, 2010).","Syllable equivalents acquisition is a critical phase for all these models. Traditional learning approaches aim to maximize the likelihood of training data by the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. However, the EM algorithm may over-fit the training data by memorizing the whole training instances. To avoid this problem, some approaches restrict that a single character in one language could be aligned to many characters of the other, but not vice versa (Li et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2009). Heuristics are introduced to obtain many-to-many alignments by combining two directional one-to-many alignments (Rama and Gali, 2009). Compared to maximum likelihood approaches, Bayesian models provide a systemic way to encode knowledges and infer compact structures. They have been successfully applied to many machine learning tasks (Liu and Gildea, 2009; Zhang et al., 2008; Blunsom et al., 2009).","Among these models, Adaptor Grammars (AGs) provide a framework for defining nonparametric Bayesian models based on PCFGs (Johnson et al., 2007). They introduce additional stochastic processes (named adaptors) allowing the expansion of an adapted symbol to depend on the expansion history. Since many existing models could be viewed as special kinds of PCFG, adaptor grammars give general Bayesian extension to them. AGs have been used in various NLP tasks such as topic modeling (Johnson, 2010), perspective modeling (Hardisty et al., 2010), morphology analysis and word segmentation (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009; Johnson, 2008).","In this paper, we extend AGs to Synchronous Adaptor Grammars (SAGs), and describe the inference algorithm based on the Pitman-Yor process (Pitman and Yor, 1997). We also describe how transliteration could be modelled under this formalism. It should be emphasized that the proposed method is language independent and heuristic-free. Experiments show the proposed approach outperforms the strong EM-based baseline in the English to Chinese transliteration task. 534"]},{"title":"2 Synchronous Adaptor Grammars 2.1 Model","paragraphs":["A Pitman-Yor Synchronous Adaptor Grammar (PYSAG) is a tuple G = (Gs, Na, a, b, α), where Gs = (N , Ts, Tt, R, S, Θ) is a Synchronous Context-Free Grammar (SCFG) (Chiang, 2007), N is a set of nonterminal symbols, Ts/Tt are source/target terminal symbols, R is a set of rewrite rules, S ∈ N is the start symbol, Θ is the distribution of rule probabilities, Na ⊆ N is the set of adapted nonterminals, a ∈ [0, 1], b ≥ 0 are vectors of discount and concentration parameters both indexed by adapted nonterminals, and α are Dirichlet prior parameters.

First, rule probabilities are sampled for each nonterminal A ∈ N (line 1) according to the Dirichlet distribution. Then synchronous trees are generated in the top-down fashion from the start symbol S (line 3) for each yield pair. For nonterminals that are not adapted, the grammar expands it just as the original synchronous grammar (function SAMPLESCFG). For each adapted nonterminal A ∈ Na, the grammar maintains a cache CA to store previously generated subtrees under A. Let zi be the subtree index in CA, denoting the synchronous subtree generated at the ith","expansion of A. At some particular time, assuming n subtrees rooted at A have been generated with m different types in the cache of A, each of which has been generated for n1, . . . , nm times respectively1",". Then the grammar either generates the (n + 1)th","synchronous subtree as SCFG (line 17) or chooses an existing subtree (line 22), according to the conditional probability P (z|zi<n).","The above generative process demonstrates “rich get richer” dynamics, i.e. previous sampled subtrees under adapted nonterminals would more likely be sampled again in following procedures. This is suitable for many learning tasks since they prefer sparse solutions to avoid the over-fitting problems.

Similarly, we also use rules in the regular expression","style X → ⟨A / A⟩+","to denote the following three rules:","X → ⟨As / As⟩","As → ⟨A / A⟩","As → ⟨A As / A As⟩ where the adapted nonterminal Syl is designed to capture the syllable equivalents between two languages, and the nonterminal NEC, SEC and TEC capture the character pairs with no empty character, empty source and empty target respectively. Note that this grammar restricts the leftmost characters on both sides must be aligned one-by-one. Since our goal is to learn the syllable equivalents, we are not interested in the subtree tree inside the syllables. We refer this grammar as syllable grammar.","The above grammar could capture inner-syllable dependencies. However, the selection of the target characters also depend on the context. For example, the following three instances are found in the training set: ⟨a a b y e / [ao] [bi]⟩","⟨a a g a a r d / [ai] [ge] [de]⟩ ⟨a a l t o / [a] [er] [tuo]⟩ where the same English syllable ⟨a a⟩ are transliterated to ⟨[ao]⟩, ⟨[ai]⟩ and ⟨[a]⟩ respectively, depending on the following syllables. To model these contextual dependencies, we propose the hierarchical SAG. The two-layer word grammar is obtained by adding following rules:","Name → ⟨Word / Word⟩+","Word → ⟨Syl / Syl⟩+","We might further add a new adapted nonterminal Col to learn the word collocations. The following rules appear in the collocation grammar:","Name → ⟨Col / Col⟩+","Col → ⟨Word / Word⟩+","Word → ⟨Syl / Syl⟩+ Figure 1 gives one synchronous parsing trees under the collocation grammar of the example ⟨m a x / [mai] [ke] [si]⟩. 3.2 Translation Model After sampling, we need a translation model to transliterate new source string to target string.

Specifically, we “flatten” the collected subtrees under Syl, i.e. removing internal nodes, to construct new synchronous rules. For example, we could get two rules from the tree in Figure 1: Syl → ⟨m a / ⟩ Syl → ⟨x / ⟩ If multiple subtrees are flattened to the same synchronous rule, we sum up the counts of these subtrees. For rules with non-adapted nonterminal as parent, we assign the probability as the same of the sampled rule probability, i.e. let θ′","r = θr. For the adapted nonterminal Syl, there are two kinds of rules: (1) the rules in the original probabilistic SCFG, and (2) the rules flattened from subtrees. We assign the rule probability as θ′ r = { ma+b n+b · θr if r is original SCFG rule nr−a n+b if r is flatten from subtree (4) where a and b are the parameters associated with Syl, m is the number of types of different rules flatten from subtrees, nr is the count of rule r, and n is the total number of flatten rules. One may verify that the rule probabilities are well normalized. Based on this merged grammar G′",", we parse the training string pairs, then encode the parsed forest into the lattice.

The results on test set outperform the EM-based baseline system on both word accuracy and mean F-score.","2. Comparing grammars of different layers, we find that the word grammars perform consistently better than the syllable grammars. These support the assumption that the context information are helpful to identify syllable equivalents. However, the collocation grammars do not further improve performance. We guess the reason is that the instances in transliteration are very short, so two-layer grammars are good enough while the collocations become very sparse, which results in unreliable probability estimation. 4.3 Discussion Table 3 shows some examples of learned syllable mappings in the final sampled tree of the syllable grammar. We can see that the PYSAGs could find good syllable mappings from the raw name pairs without any heuristic or restriction.
