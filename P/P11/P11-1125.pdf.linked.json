One of the state-of-the-art system combination methods for MT is based on confusion networks, which are compact graph-based structures representing multiple hypotheses (Bangalore et al., 2001).","Confusion networks are constructed based on string similarity information. First, one skeleton or backbone sentence is selected. Then, other hypotheses are aligned against the skeleton, forming a lattice with each arc representing alternative word candidates. The alignment method is either model-based (Matusov et al., 2006; He et al., 2008) in which a statistical word aligner is used to compute hypothesis alignment, or edit-based (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Sim et al., 2007) in which alignment is measured by an evaluation metric, such as translation error rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006). The new translation hypothesis is generated by selecting the best path through the network.","We present a novel method for system combination which exploits the syntactic similarity of system outputs. Instead of constructing a string-based confusion network, we generate a packed forest (Billot and Lang, 1989; Mi et al., 2008) which encodes exponentially many parse trees in a polynomial space. The packed forest, or confusion forest, is constructed by merging the MT outputs with regard to their syntactic consensus. We employ a grammar-based method to generate the confusion forest: First, system outputs are parsed. Second, a set of rules are extracted from the parse trees. Third, a packed forest is generated using a variant of Earley’s algorithm (Earley, 1970) starting from the unique root symbol. New hypotheses are selected by searching the best derivation in the forest. The grammar, a set of rules, is limited to those found in the parse trees. Spurious ambiguity during the generation step is further reduced by encoding the tree local contextual information in each non-terminal symbol, such as parent and sibling labels, using the state representation in Earley’s algorithm. 1249","Experiments were carried out for the system combination task of the fifth workshop on statistical machine translation (WMT10) in four directions, {Czech, French, German, Spanish}-to-English (Callison-Burch et al., 2010), and we found comparable performance to the conventional confusion network based system combination in two language pairs, and statistically significant improvements in the others.","First, we will review the state-of-the-art method which is a system combination framework based on confusion networks (§2). Then, we will introduce a novel system combination method based on confusion forest (§3) and present related work in consensus translations (§4). Experiments are presented in Section 5 followed by discussion and our conclu-sion."]},{"title":"2 Combination by Confusion Network","paragraphs":["The system combination framework based on confusion network starts from computing pairwise alignment between hypotheses by taking one hypothesis as a reference. Matusov et al. (2006) employs a model based approach in which a statistical word aligner, such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), is used to align the hypotheses. Sim et al. (2007) in-troduced TER (Snover et al., 2006) to measure the edit-based alignment.","Then, one hypothesis is selected, for example by employing a minimum Bayes risk criterion (Sim et al., 2007), as a skeleton, or a backbone, which serves as a building block for aligning the rest of the hypotheses. Other hypotheses are aligned against the skeleton using the pairwise alignment. Figure 1(b) illustrates an example of a confusion network constructed from the four hypotheses in Figure 1(a), as-suming the first hypothesis is selected as our skeleton. The network consists of several arcs, each of which represents an alternative word at that position, including the empty symbol, ε.","This pairwise alignment strategy is prone to spurious insertions and repetitions due to alignment errors such as in Figure 1(a) in which “green” in the third hypothesis is aligned with “forest” in the skeleton.

For example, the last hypothesis in Figure 1(a) has a passive voice grammatical construction while the others are active voice. This large grammatical difference may produce a longer sentence with spuriously in-serted words, as in “I saw the blue trees was found” in Figure 1(c). Rosti et al. (2007b) partially resolved the problem by constructing a large network in which each hypothesis was treated as a skeleton and the multiple networks were merged into a single network."]},{"title":"3 Combination by Confusion Forest","paragraphs":["The confusion network approach to system combination encodes multiple hypotheses into a compact lattice structure by using word-level consensus.

The forest is represented as a hypergraph which is exploited in parsing (Klein and Manning, 2001; Huang and Chiang, 2005) and machine translation (Chiang, 2007; Huang and Chiang, 2007).","More formally, a hypergraph is a pair ⟨V, E⟩ where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of hyperedges. Each node in V is represented as X@p where X ∈ N is a non-terminal symbol and p is an address (Shieber et al., 1995) that encapsulates each node id relative to its parent. The root node is given the address ε and the address of the first child of node p is given p.1.

Second, Initialization: [TOP → •S, 0] : 1̄ Scan: [X → α • xβ, h] : u [X → αx • β, h] : u Predict: [X → α • Yβ, h] [Y → •γ, h + 1] : u Y u → γ ∈ G, h < H Complete:","[X → α • Yβ, h] : u [Y → γ•, h + 1] : v [X → αY • β, h] : u ⊗ v Goal: [TOP → S•, 0] Figure 3: The deductive system for Earley’s generation algorithm a grammar is learned by treating each hyperedge as an instance of a CFG rule. Third, a forest is generated from the unique root symbol of the extracted grammar through non-terminal rewriting. 3.1 Forest Generation Given the extracted grammar, we apply a variant of Earley’s algorithm (Earley, 1970) which can generate strings in a left-to-right manner from the unique root symbol, TOP. Figure 3 presents the deductive inference rules (Goodman, 1999) for our generation algorithm. We use capital letters X ∈ N to denote non-terminals and x ∈ T for terminals. Lowercase Greek letters α, β and γ are strings of terminals and non-terminals (T ∪ N )∗",". u and v are weights associated with each item.","The major difference compared to Earley’s parsing algorithm is that we ignore the terminal span information each non-terminal covers and keep track of the height of derivations by h. The scanning step will always succeed by moving the dot to the right. Combined with the prediction and completion steps, our algorithm may potentially generate a spuriously deep forest. Thus, the height of the forest is constrained in the prediction step not to exceed H, which is empirically set to 1.5 times the maximum 1251 height of the parsed system outputs. 3.2 Tree Annotation The grammar compiled from the parsed trees is local in that it can represent a finite number of sentences translated from a specific input sentence. Although its coverage is limited, our generation algorithm may yield a spuriously large forest. As a way to reduce spurious ambiguities, we relabel the non-terminal symbols assigned to each parse tree before extracting rules.","Here, we replace each non-terminal symbol by the state representation of Earley’s algorithm corresponding to the sequence of prediction steps starting from TOP. Figure 4(a) presents an example parse tree with each symbol replaced by the Earley’s state in Figure 4(b). For example, the label for VBD is replaced by •S + NP : •VP + •VBD : NP which corresponds to the prediction steps of TOP → •S, S → NP • VP and VP → •VBD NP. The context represented in the Earley’s state is further limited by the vertical and horizontal Markovization (Klein and Manning, 2003). We define the vertical order v in which the label is limited to memorize only v previous prediction steps. For instance, setting v = 1 yields NP : •VP + •VBD : NP in our example. Likewise, we introduce the horizontal order h which limits the number of sibling labels memorized on the left and the right of the dotted label. Limiting h = 1 implies that each deductive step is encoded with at most three symbols.","No limits in the horizontal and vertical Markovization orders implies memorizing of all the deductions and yields a confusion forest representing the union of parse trees through the grammar collection and the generation processes. More relaxed horizontal orders allow more reordering of subtrees in a confusion forest by discarding the sibling context in each prediction step. Likewise, constraining the vertical order generates a deeper forest by ignoring the sequence of symbols leading to a particular node. 3.3 Forest Rescoring From the packed forest F , new k-best derivations are extracted from all possible derivations D by efficient forest-based algorithms for k-best parsing (Huang and Chiang, 2005).

One of the simplest forms is a sentence-based combination in which hypotheses are simply reranked without merging (Nomoto, 2004). Frederking and Nirenburg (1994) 1252 proposed a phrasal combination by merging hypotheses in a chart structure, while others depended on confusion networks, or similar structures, as a building block for merging hypotheses at the word level (Bangalore et al., 2001; Matusov et al., 2006; He et al., 2008; Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Sim et al., 2007). Our work is the first to explicitly exploit syntactic similarity for system combination by merging hypotheses into a syntactic packed forest. The confusion forest approach may suffer from parsing errors such as the confusion network construction influenced by alignment errors. Even with parsing errors, we can still take a tree fragment-level consensus as long as a parser is consistent in that similar syntactic mistakes would be made for similar hypotheses.","Rosti et al. (2007a) describe a re-generation approach to consensus translation in which a phrasal translation table is constructed from the MT outputs aligned with an input source sentence. New translations are generated by decoding the source sentence again using the newly extracted phrase table. Our grammar-based approach can be regarded as a re-generation approach in which an off-the-shelf monolingual parser, instead of a word aligner, is used to annotate syntactic information to each hypothesis, then, a new translation is generated from the merged forest, not from the input source sentence through decoding. In terms of generation, our approach is an instance of statistical generation (Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Langkilde, 2000). Instead of generating forests from semantic representations (Langkilde, 2000), we generate forests from a CFG encoding the consensus among parsed hypotheses.","Liu et al. (2009) present joint decoding in which a translation forest is constructed from two distinct MT systems, tree-to-string and string-to-string, by merging forest outputs. Their merging method is either translation-level in which no new translation is generated, or derivation-level in that the rules sharing the same left-hand-side are used in both systems. While our work is similar in that a new forest is constructed by sharing rules among systems, although their work involves no consensus translation and requires structures internal to each system such as model combinations (DeNero et al., 2010).","cz-en de-en es-en fr-en","# of systems 6 16 8 14","avg. words tune 10.6K 10.9K 10.9K 11.0K","test 50.5K 52.1K 52.1K 52.4K","sentences tune 455","test 2,034 Table 1: WMT10 system combination tuning/testing data"]},{"title":"5 Experiments 5.1 Setup","paragraphs":["We ran our experiments for the WMT10 system combination task usinge four language pairs, {Czech, French, German, Spanish}-to-English (Callison-Burch et al., 2010).

Input to our system is a collection of hypergraphs, a set of parsed hypotheses, from which rules are extracted and a new forest is generated as described in Section 3. Our baseline, also implemented in cicada, is a confusion network-based system combination method (§2) which incrementally aligns hypotheses to the growing network using TER (Rosti et al., 2008) and merges multiple networks into a large single network. After performing epsilon removal, the network is transformed into a forest by parsing with monotone rules of S → X, S → S X and X → x. k-best translations are extracted from the forest using the forest-based algorithms in Section 3.3. 5.2 Features The feature weight vector w in Equation 1 is tuned by MERT over hypergraphs (Kumar et al., 2009).","We use three lower-cased 5-gram language mod-1253 els hi","lm(d): English Gigaword Fourth edition1",", the English side of French-English 109","corpus and the news commentary English data2",".

The larger potentials do not imply better translations, probably due to the larger search space with increased search errors. We also conjecture that syntactic variations were not captured by the n-gram like string-based features in Section 5.2, therefore resulting in BLEU loss, which will be in-vestigated in future work.","In contrast, CN has more potential for generat-ing better translations, with the exception of the German-to-English direction, with scores that are usually 10 points better than simple sentence-wise reranking. The low potential in German should be interpreted in the light of the extremely large confusion network in Table 4. We postulate that the divergence in German hypotheses yields wrong align-ments, and therefore amounts to larger networks with incorrect hypotheses. Table 4 also shows that CN produces a forest that is an order of magnitude larger than those created by CFs. Although we can-not directly relate the runtime and the number of hyperedges in CN and CFs, since the shape of the forests are different, CN requires more space to encode the hypotheses than those by CFs.","Table 5 compares the average length of the minimum/maximum hypothesis that each method can produce. CN may generate shorter hypotheses, whereby CF prefers longer hypotheses as we decrease the vertical order.
