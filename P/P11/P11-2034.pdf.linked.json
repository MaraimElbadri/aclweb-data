Attribute-value grammars are usually coupled with separate statistical components for parse selection and fluency ranking. We propose reversible stochastic attribute-value grammars, in which a single statistical model is employed both for parse selection and fluency ranking."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Reversible grammars were introduced as early as 1975 by Martin Kay (1975). In the eighties, the popularity of attribute-value grammars (AVG) was in part motivated by their inherent reversible na-ture. Later, AVG were enriched with a statistical component (Abney, 1997): stochastic AVG (SAVG). Training a SAVG is feasible if a stochastic model is assumed which is conditioned on the input sentences (Johnson et al., 1999). Various parsers based on this approach now exist for various languages (Toutanova et al., 2002; Riezler et al., 2002; van Noord and Malouf, 2005; Miyao and Tsujii, 2005; Clark and Curran, 2004; Forst, 2007). SAVG can be applied for generation to select the most fluent realization from the set of possible realizations (Velldal et al., 2004). In this case, the stochastic model is conditioned on the input logical forms. Such generators exist for various languages as well (Velldal and Oepen, 2006; Nakanishi and Miyao, 2005; Cahill et al., 2007; de Kok and van Noord, 2010).","If an AVG is applied both to parsing and generation, two distinct stochastic components are required, one for parsing, and one for generation. To some extent this is reasonable, because some features are only relevant in a certain direction. For instance, features that represent aspects of the surface word order are important for generation, but irrelevant for parsing. Similarly, features which describe aspects of the logical form are important for parsing, but irrelevant for generation. Yet, there are also many features that are relevant in both directions. For instance, for Dutch, a very effective feature signals a direct object NP in fronted position in main clauses. If a main clause is parsed which starts with a NP, the disambiguation component will favor a subject reading of that NP. In generation, the fluency component will favor subject fronting over object fronting. Clearly, such shared preferences are not accidental.","In this paper we propose reversible SAVG in which a single stochastic component is applied both in parsing and generation. We provide experimental evidence that such reversible SAVG achieve similar performance as their directional counterparts. A single, reversible model is to be preferred over two distinct models because it explains why preferences in a disambiguation component and a fluency component, such as the preference for subject fronting over object fronting, are shared. A single, reversible model is furthermore of practical interest for its simplicity, compactness, and maintainability. As an important additional advantage, reversible models are applicable for tasks which combine aspects of parsing and generation, such as word-graph parsing and paraphrasing. In situations where only a small amount of training data is available for parsing or generation, cross-pollination improves the perfor-194 mance of a model. If preferences are shared between parsing and generation, it follows that a generator could benefit from parsing data and vice versa. We present experimental results indicating that in such a bootstrap scenario a reversible model achieves better performance."]},{"title":"2 Reversible SAVG","paragraphs":["As Abney (1997) shows, we cannot use relatively simple techniques such as relative frequencies to obtain a model for estimating derivation probabilities in attribute-value grammars. As an alternative, he proposes a maximum entropy model, where the probability of a derivation d is defined as: p(d) = 1 Z exp ∑ i λifi(d) (1)","fi(d) is the frequency of feature fi in derivation d. A weight λi is associated with each feature fi. In (1), Z is a normalizer which is defined as follows, where Ω is the set of derivations defined by the grammar: Z = ∑ d′ ∈Ω exp ∑ i","λifi(d′ ) (2) Training this model requires access to all derivations Ω allowed by the grammar, which makes it hard to implement the model in practice.","Johnson et al. (1999) alleviate this problem by proposing a model which conditions on the input sentence s: p(d|s). Since the number of derivations for a given sentence s is usually finite, the calcula-tion of the normalizer is much more practical. Conversely, in generation the model is conditioned on the input logical form l, p(d|l) (Velldal et al., 2004). In such directional stochastic attribute-value grammars, the probability of a derivation d given an input x (a sentence or a logical form) is defined as: p(d|x) =","1 Z(x) exp ∑ i λifi(x, d) (3) with Z(x) as (Ω(x) are all derivations for input x): Z(x) = ∑ d′ ∈Ω(x) exp ∑ i","λifi(x, d′ ) (4) Consequently, the constraint put on feature values during training only refers to derivations with the same input. If X is the set of inputs (for parsing, all sentences in the treebank; for generation, all logical forms), then we have: Ep(fi) − Ep̃(fi) = 0 ≡ (5) ∑ x∈X ∑ d∈Ω(x) p̃(x)p(d|x)fi(x, d) − p̃(x, d)fi(x, d) = 0","Here we assume a uniform distribution for p̃(x). Let j(d) be a function which returns 0 if the derivation d is inconsistent with the treebank, and 1 in case the derivation is correct. p̃(x, d) is now defined in such a way that it is 0 for incorrect derivations, and uniform for correct derivations for a given input: p̃(x, d) = p̃(x) j(d)","Σd′ ∈Ω(x)j(d′",") (6)","Directional SAVG make parsing and generation practically feasible, but require separate models for parse disambiguation and fluency ranking.","Since parsing and generation both create derivations that are in agreement with the constraints implied by the input, a single model can accompany the attribute-value grammar. Such a model estimates the probability of a derivation d given a set of constraints c, p(d|c). We use conditional maximum entropy models to estimate p(d|c): p(d|c) = 1 Z(c) exp ∑ i λifi(c, d) (7) Z(c) = ∑ d′ ∈Ω(c)exp ∑ i","λifi(c, d′ ) (8)","We derive a reversible model by training on data for parse disambiguation and fluency ranking simultaneously. In contrast to directional models, we impose the two constraints per feature given in figure 1: one on the feature value with respect to the sentences S in the parse disambiguation treebank and the other on the feature value with respect to logical forms L in the fluency ranking treebank. As a result of the constraints on training defined in figure 1, the feature weights in the reversible model distinguish, at the same time, good parses from bad parses as well as good realizations from bad realizations."]},{"title":"3 Experimental setup and evaluation","paragraphs":["To evaluate reversible SAVG, we conduct experiments in the context of the Alpino system for Dutch. 195 ∑ s∈S ∑ d∈Ω(s) p̃(s)p(d|c = s)fi(s, d) − p̃(c = s, d)fi(s, d) = 0 ∑ l∈L ∑ d∈Ω(l) p̃(l)p(d|c = l)fi(l, d) − p̃(c = l, d)fi(l, d) = 0 Figure 1: Constraints imposed on feature values for training reversible models p(d|c). Alpino provides a wide-coverage grammar, lexicon and parser (van Noord, 2006). Recently, a sentence realizer has been added that uses the same grammar and lexicon (de Kok and van Noord, 2010).","In the experiments, the cdbl part of the Alpino Treebank (van der Beek et al., 2002) is used as training data (7,154 sentences). The WR-P-P-H part (2,267 sentences) of the LASSY corpus (van Noord et al., 2010), which consists of text from the Trouw 2001 newspaper, is used for testing. 3.1 Features The features that we use in the experiment are the same features which are available in the Alpino parser and generator. In the following section, these features are described in some detail. Word adjacency. Two word adjacency features are used as auxiliary distributions (Johnson and Riezler, 2000). The first feature is the probability of the sentence according to a word trigram model. The second feature is the probability of the sentence according to a tag trigram model that uses the part-of-speech tags assigned by the Alpino system. In both models, linear interpolation smoothing for unknown trigrams, and Laplacian smoothing for unknown words and tags is applied. The trigram models have been trained on the Twente Nieuws Corpus corpus (approximately 110 million words), exclud-ing the Trouw 2001 corpus. In conventional parsing tasks, the value of the word trigram model is the same for all derivations of a given input sentence. Lexical frames. Lexical analysis is applied during parsing to find all possible subcategorization frames for the tokens in the input sentence. Since some frames occur more frequently in good parses than others, we use feature templates that record the frames that were used in a parse. An example of such a feature is: ”‘to play’ serves as an intransitive verb”. We also use an auxiliary distribution of word and frame combinations that was trained on a large corpus of automatically annotated sentences (436 million words). The values of lexical frame features are constant for all derivations in sentence realization, unless the frame is not specified in the logical form. Dependency relations. There are also feature templates which describe aspects of the dependency structure. For each dependency, three types of dependency features are extracted. Examples of such features are ”a pronoun is used as the subject of a verb”, ”the pronoun ’she’ is used as the subject of a verb”, ”the noun ’beer’ is used as the object of the verb ’drink’”. In addition, features are used which implement auxiliary distributions for selectional preferences, as described in Van Noord (2007). In conventional realization tasks, the values of these features are constant for all derivations for a given input representation. Syntactic features. Syntactic features include features which record the application of each grammar rule, as well as features which record the application of a rule in the context of another rule. An example of the latter is ’rule 167 is used to construct the second daughter of a derivation constructed by rule 233’. In addition, there are features describing more complex syntactic patterns such as: fronting of subjects and other noun phrases, orderings in the middle field, long-distance dependencies, and parallelism of conjuncts in coordination. 3.2 Parse disambiguation Earlier we assumed that a treebank is a set of correct derivations. In practice, however, a treebank only contains an abstraction of such derivations (in 196 our case sentences with corresponding dependency structures), thus abstracting away from syntactic de-tails needed in a parse disambiguation model. As in Osborne (2000), the derivations for the parse disambiguation model are created by parsing the training corpus. In the current setting, up to at most 3000 derivations are created for every sentence. These derivations are then compared to the gold standard dependency structure to judge the quality of the parses. For a given sentence, the parses with the highest concept accuracy (van Noord, 2006) are considered correct, the rest is treated as incorrect. 3.3 Fluency ranking For fluency ranking we also need access to full derivations. To ensure that the system is able to generate from the dependency structures in the treebank, we parse the corresponding sentence, and select the parse with the dependency structure that corresponds most closely to the dependency structure in the treebank. The resulting dependency structures are fed into the Alpino chart generator to construct derivations for each dependency structure. The derivations for which the corresponding sentences are closest to the original sentence in the treebank are marked correct. Due to a limit on generation time, some longer sentences and corresponding dependency structures were excluded from the data. As a result, the average sentence length was 15.7 tokens, with a maximum of 26 tokens. To compare a realization to the correct sentence, we use the General Text Matcher (GTM) method (Melamed et al., 2003; Cahill, 2009). 3.4 Training the models Models are trained by taking an informative sample of Ω(c) for each c in the training data (Osborne, 2000). This sample consists of at most 100 randomly selected derivations. Frequency-based feature selection is applied (Ratnaparkhi, 1999). A feature f partitions Ω(c), if there are derivations d and d′","in Ω(c) such that f (c, d) ̸= f (c, d′","). A feature is used if it partitions the informative sample of Ω(c) for at least two c. Table 1 lists the resulting characteristics of the training data for each model.","We estimate the parameters of the conditional","Features Inputs Derivations","Generation 1727 3688 141808","Parse 25299 7133 376420","Reversible 25578 10811 518228 Table 1: Size of the training data for each model maximum entropy models using TinyEst,1","with a Gaussian (l2) prior distribution (μ = 0, σ2","= 1000) to reduce overfitting (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999)."]},{"title":"4 Results 4.1 Parse disambiguation","paragraphs":["Table 2 shows the results for parse disambiguation.
