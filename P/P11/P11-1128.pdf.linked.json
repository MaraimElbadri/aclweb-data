So far, most of them have been based on synchronous context-free grammars (CFG) (Chiang, 2007), tree substitution grammars (TSG) (Eisner, 2003; Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008), and inversion transduction grammars (ITG) (Wu, 1997; Xiong et al., 2006). Although these for-malisms present simple and precise mechanisms for describing the basic recursive structure of sentences, they are not powerful enough to model some important features of natural language syntax. For example, Chiang (2006) points out that the translation of languages that can stack an unbounded number of clauses in an “inside-out” way (Wu, 1997) provably goes beyond the expressive power of synchronous CFG and TSG. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to take advantage of more powerful synchronous grammars to improve machine translation.","Synchronous tree adjoining grammars (TAG) (Shieber and Schabes, 1990) are a good candidate. As a formal tree rewriting system, TAG (Joshi et al., 1975; Joshi, 1985) provides a larger domain of locality than CFG to state linguistic dependencies that are far apart since the formalism treats trees as basic building blocks. As a mildly context-sensitive grammar, TAG is conjectured to be powerful enough to model natural languages. Synchronous TAG generalizes TAG by allowing the construction of a pair of trees using the TAG operations of substitution and adjoining on tree pairs. The idea of using synchronous TAG in machine translation has been pursued by several researchers (Abeille et al., 1990; Prigent, 1994; Dras, 1999), but only recently in its probabilistic form (Nesson et al., 2006; DeNeefe and Knight, 2009). Shieber (2007) argues that probabilistic synchronous TAG possesses appealing properties such as expressivity and trainability for building a machine translation system.","However, one major challenge for applying synchronous TAG to machine translation is computational complexity. While TAG requires O(n6",") time for monolingual parsing, synchronous TAG requires O(n12",") for bilingual parsing. One solution is to use tree insertion grammars (TIG) introduced by Schabes and Waters (1995). As a restricted form of TAG, TIG still allows for adjoining of unbounded trees but only requires O(n3",") time for monolingual parsing. Nesson et al.

DeNeefe and Knight (2009) prove that adjoining can improve translation quality significantly over a state-of-the-art string-to-tree system (Galley et al., 2006) that uses synchronous TSG with tractable computational complexity.","In this paper, we introduce synchronous TAG into tree-to-string translation (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), which is the simplest and fastest among syntax-based approaches (Section 2). We propose a new rule extraction algorithm based on GHKM (Galley et al., 2004) that directly induces a synchronous TAG from an aligned and parsed bilingual corpus without converting Treebank-style trees to TAG derivations explicitly (Section 3). As tree-to-string translation takes a source parse tree as input, the decoding can be cast as a tree parsing problem (Eisner, 2003): reconstructing TAG derivations from a derived tree using tree-to-string rules that allow for both substitution and adjoining. We describe how to convert TAG derivations to translation forest (Section 4). We evaluated the new tree-to-string system on NIST Chinese-English tests and obtained consistent improvements (+0.7 BLEU) over the STSG-based baseline system without significant loss in efficiency (1.6 times slower) (Section 5)."]},{"title":"2 Model","paragraphs":["A synchronous TAG consists of a set of linked elementary tree pairs: initial and auxiliary. An initial tree is a tree of which the interior nodes are all labeled with non-terminal symbols, and the nodes on the frontier are either words or non-terminal symbols marked with a down arrow (↓).

DeNeefe and Knight (2009) propose an algorithm to extract synchronous TIG rules from an aligned and parsed bilingual corpus. They first classify tree nodes into heads, arguments, and adjuncts using heuristics (Collins, 2003), then transform a Treebank-style tree into a TIG derivation, and finally extract minimallysized rules from the derivation tree and the string on the other side, constrained by the alignments. Probabilistic models can be estimated by collecting counts over the derivation trees.","However, one challenge is that there are many TAG derivations that can yield the same derived tree, even with respect to a single grammar. It is difficult to choose appropriate single derivations that enable the resulting grammar to translate unseen data well. DeNeefe and Knight (2009) indicate that the way to reconstruct TIG derivations has a direct effect on final translation quality. They suggest that one possible solution is to use derivation forest rather than a single derivation tree for rule extraction.","Alternatively, we extend the GHKM algorithm (Galley et al., 2004) to directly extract tree-to-string rules that allow for both substitution and adjoining from aligned and parsed data. There is no need for transforming a parse tree into a TAG derivation explicitly before rule extraction and all derivations can be easily reconstructed using extracted rules. 1","Our rule extraction algorithm involves two steps: (1) extracting minimal rules and (2) composition. 3.1 Extracting Minimal Rules Figure 2 shows a training example, which consists of a Chinese parse tree, an English string, and the word alignment between them. By convention, shaded nodes are called frontier nodes from which tree-to-string rules can be extracted. Note that the source phrase dominated by a frontier node and its corresponding target phrase are consistent with the word alignment: all words in the source phrase are aligned to all words in the corresponding target phrase and vice versa.","We distinguish between three categories of tree-","1","Note that our algorithm does not take heads, complements, and adjuncts into consideration and extracts all possible rules with respect to word alignment. Our hope is that this treatment would make our system more robust in the presence of noisy data. It is possible to use the linguistic preferences as features. We leave this for future work. 1281 to-string rules:","1. substitution rules, in which the source tree is an initial tree without adjoining sites.","2. adjoining rules, in which the source tree is an initial tree with at least one adjoining site.","3. auxiliary rules, in which the source tree is an auxiliary tree.","For example, in Figure 1, α1 is a substitution rule, α2 is an adjoining rule, and β1 is an auxiliary rule.","Minimal substitution rules are the same with those in STSG (Galley et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006) and therefore can be extracted directly using GHKM. By minimal, we mean that the interior nodes are not frontier and cannot be decomposed. For example, in Table 2, rule 1 (for short r1) is a minimal substitution rule extracted from NR0,1.","Minimal adjoining rules are defined as minimal substitution rules, except that each root node must be an adjoining site. In Table 2, r2 is a minimal substitution rule extracted from NP0,1. As NP0,1 is a descendant of NP0,2 with the same label, NP0,1 is a possible adjoining site. Therefore, r6 can be derived from r2 and licensed as a minimal adjoining rule extracted from NP0,2. Similarly, four minimal adjoining rules are extracted from NP0,3 because it has four frontier descendants labeled with NP.","Minimal auxiliary rules are derived from minimal substitution and adjoining rules. For example, in Table 2, r7 and r10 are derived from the minimal substitution rule r5 while r8 and r11 are derived from r15. Note that a minimal auxiliary rule can have adjoining sites (e.g., r8).","Table 1 lists 17 minimal substitution rules, 7 minimal adjoining rules, and 7 minimal auxiliary rules extracted from Figure 2. 3.2 Composition We can obtain composed rules that capture rich contexts by substituting and adjoining minimal initial and auxiliary rules. For example, the composition of r12, r17, r25, r26, r29, and r31 yields an initial rule with two adjoining sites: ( IP ( NP0:1 ( NR àobāmǎ ) ) ( VP2:3 ( VV yǔyı̌ ) ( NP ( NN qiǎnzé ) ) ) ) → Obama has condemned Note that the source phrase “àobāmǎ . . . yǔyı̌ qiǎnzé” is discontinuous. Our model allows both the source and target phrases of an initial rule with adjoining sites to be discontinuous, which goes beyond the expressive power of synchronous CFG and TSG.","Similarly, the composition of two auxiliary rules r8 and r16 yields a new auxiliary rule: ( NP ( NP ( x1:NP∗ ) ( x2:NP↓ ) ) ( x3:NP↓ ) ) → x1x2x3","We first compose initial rules and then compose auxiliary rules, both in a bottom-up way. To maintain a reasonable grammar size, we follow Liu (2006) to restrict that the tree height of a rule is no greater than 3 and the source surface string is no longer than 7.","To learn the probability models Pi(α), Ps(α|η), Pa(β|η), and Pa(NONE|η), we collect and normalize counts over these extracted rules following DeNeefe and Knight (2009)."]},{"title":"4 Decoding","paragraphs":["Given a synchronous TAG and a derived source tree π, a tree-to-string decoder finds the English yield of the best derivation of which the Chinese yield matches π: ê = e( arg max D s.t. f(D)=π P (D)) (4) This is called tree parsing (Eisner, 2003) as the decoder finds ways of decomposing π into elementary trees.","Tree-to-string decoding with STSG is usually treated as forest rescoring (Huang and Chiang, 2007) that involves two steps.

Then, the decoder searches for the best derivation in the translation forest intersected with n-gram language models and outputs the target string. 2","Decoding with STAG, however, poses one major challenge to forest rescoring.

Therefore, we divide forest rescoring for STAG into three steps:","1. matching, matching STAG rules against the input tree to obtain a TAG derivation forest;","2. conversion, converting the TAG derivation forest into a translation forest;","3. intersection, intersecting the translation forest with an n-gram language model.","Given a tree-to-string rule, rule matching is to find a subtree of the input tree that is identical to the source side of the rule. While matching STSG rules against a derived tree is straightforward, it is some-what non-trivial for STAG rules that move beyond nodes of a local tree. We follow Liu et al. (2006) to enumerate all elementary subtrees and match STAG rules against these subtrees. This can be done by first enumerating all minimal initial and auxiliary trees and then combining them to obtain composed trees, assuming that every node in the input tree is frontier (see Section 3). We impose the same restrictions on the tree height and length as in rule extraction. Figure 3 shows some matched trees and corresponding rules. Each node in a matched tree is annotated with a span as superscript to facilitate identification. For example, IP0,8","in α1 means that IP0,8 in Figure 2 is matched. Note that its left child NP2,3","is not its direct descendant in Figure 2, suggesting that adjoining is required at this site.","A TAG derivation tree specifies uniquely how a derived tree is constructed using elementary trees (Joshi, 1985). A node in a derivation tree is an elementary tree and an edge corresponds to operations on related elementary trees: substitution or adjoining. We introduce TAG derivation forest, a compact representation of multiple TAG derivation trees, to encodes all matched TAG derivation trees of the input derived tree.","Figure 4 shows part of a TAG derivation forest. The six matched elementary trees are nodes in the derivation forest. Dashed and solid lines represent substitution and adjoining, respectively. We use Gorn addresses as tree addresses: 0 is the address of the root node, p is the address of the pth","child of the root node, and p · q is the address of the qth","child of the node at the address p.

A hyperedge in a translation forest corresponds to a translation rule. Mi et al. (2008) describe how to convert a derived tree to a translation forest using tree-to-string rules only allowing for substitution. Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to convert a derivation forest includ-ing adjoining to a translation forest. To alleviate this problem, we combine initial rules with adjoining sites and associated auxiliary rules to form equivalent initial rules without adjoining sites on the fly during decoding. Consider α1 in Figure 3. It has an adjoining site NP2,3",".

A node in a composition tree is a matched elementary tree and an edge corresponds to adjoining operations. The root node must be an initial tree with at least one adjoining site. The descendants of the root node must all be auxiliary trees. For example, ( α1 ( β2 ) ) and ( α1 ( β1 ( β3 ) ) ) are two composition trees in Figure 4. The number of children of a node in a composition tree depends on the number of adjoining sites in the node. We use composition forest to encode all possible composition trees.","Often, a node in a composition tree may have multiple matched rules.
