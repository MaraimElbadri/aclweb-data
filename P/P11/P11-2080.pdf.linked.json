In this paper, we introduce two simple improvements to these features: one which smooths the probability of translating word f to word e using English morphology, and one which conditions it on the kind of training data that f and e co-occurred in. These new variations lead to improvements of up to +0.8 BLEU, with an average improvement of +0.6 BLEU across two language pairs, two genres, and two translation systems."]},{"title":"2 Background","paragraphs":["Since there are slight variations in how the lexical weighting features are computed, we begin by defining the baseline lexical weighting features. If f = f1 · · · fn and e = e1 · · · em are a training sentence pair, let ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n) be the (possibly empty) set of positions in f that ei is aligned to.","First, compute a word translation table from the word-aligned parallel text: for each sentence pair and each i, let c( f j, ei) ← c( f j, ei) + 1 |ai| for j ∈ ai (1) c(NULL, ei) ← c(NULL, ei) + 1 if |ai| = 0 (2) Then t(e | f ) = c( f, e) ∑ e c( f, e) (3) where f can be NULL.","Second, during phrase-pair extraction, store with each phrase pair the alignments between the words in the phrase pair. If it is observed with more than one word alignment pattern, store the most frequent pattern.","Third, for each phrase pair ( f̄ , ē, a), compute t(ē | f̄ ) = |ē|∏ i=1    1 |ai| ∑ j∈ai t(ēi | f̄ j) if |ai| > 0 t(ēi | NULL) otherwise (4) This generalizes to synchronous CFG rules in the obvious way.","Similarly, compute the reverse probability t( f̄ | ē). Then add two new model features − log t(ē | f̄ ) and − log t( f̄ | ē) 455","translation feature (7) (8) small LM 26.7 24.3 large LM 31.4 28.2 − log t(ē | f̄ ) 9.3 9.9 − log t( f̄ | ē) 5.8 6.3 Table 1: Although the language models prefer translation (8), which translates 朋友 and 伙伴 as singular nouns, the lexical weighting features prefer translation (7), which incorrectly generates plural nouns. All features are negative log-probabilities, so lower numbers indicate preference."]},{"title":"3 Morphological smoothing","paragraphs":["Consider the following example Chinese sentence:","(5) 温家宝 Wēn Jiābǎo Wen Jiabao 表示 biǎoshì said , , , 科特迪瓦 Kētèdíwǎ Côte d’Ivoire 是 shì is 中国 Zhōngguó China 在 zài in 非洲 Fēizhōu Africa 的 de ’s 好 hǎo good 朋友 péngyǒu friend , , , 好 hǎo good 伙伴 huǒbàn partner . . .","(6) Human: Wen Jiabao said that Côte d’Ivoire is a good friend and a good partner of China’s in Africa.","(7) MT (baseline): Wen Jiabao said that Cote d’Ivoire is China’s good friends, and good partners in Africa.","(8) MT (better): Wen Jiabao said that Cote d’Ivoire is China’s good friend and good partner in Africa. The baseline machine translation (7) incorrectly generates plural nouns. Even though the language models (LMs) prefer singular nouns, the lexical weighting features prefer plural nouns (Table 1).1","The reason for this is that the Chinese words do not have any marking for number. Therefore the information needed to mark friend and partner for number must come from the context. The LMs are able to capture this context: the 5-gram is China’s good","1","The presence of an extra comma in translation (7) affects the LM scores only slightly; removing the comma would make them 26.4 and 32.0. f e t(e | f ) t( f | e) tm(e | f ) tm( f | e) 朋友 friends 0.44 0.44 0.47 0.48 朋友 friend 0.21 0.58 0.19 0.48 伙伴 partners 0.44 0.60 0.40 0.53 伙伴 partner 0.13 0.40 0.17 0.53 Table 2: The morphologically-smoothed lexical weighting features weaken the preference for singular or plural translations, with the exception of t(friends | 朋友). friend is observed in our large LM, and the 4-gram China’s good friend in our small LM, but China’s good friends is not observed in either LM. Likewise, the 5-grams good friend and good partner and good friends and good partners are both observed in our LMs, but neither good friend and good partners nor good friends and good partner is.","By contrast, the lexical weighting tables (Table 2, columns 3–4), which ignore context, have a strong preference for plural translations, except in the case of t(朋友 | friend). Therefore we hypothesize that, for Chinese-English translation, we should weaken the lexical weighting features’ morphological preferences so that more contextual features can do their work.","Running a morphological stemmer (Porter, 1980) on the English side of the parallel data gives a three-way parallel text: for each sentence, we have French f, English e, and stemmed English e′",". We can then build two word translation tables, t(e′","| f ) and t(e | e′","), and form their product tm(e | f ) = ∑ e′","t(e′ | f )t(e | e′",") (9) Similarly, we can compute tm( f | e) in the opposite direction.2","(See Table 2, columns 5–6.) These tables can then be extended to phrase pairs or synchronous CFG rules as before and added as two new features of the model: − log tm(ē | f̄ ) and − log tm( f̄ | ē) The feature tm(ē | f̄ ) does still prefer certain word-forms, as can be seen in Table 2. But because e is generated from e′","and not from f , we are protected from the situation where a rare f leads to poor estimates for the e.","2","Since the Porter stemmer is deterministic, we always have t(e′","| e) = 1.0, so that tm( f | e) = t( f | e′","), as seen in the last column of Table 2. 456","When we applied an analogous approach to Arabic-English translation, stemming both Arabic and English, we generated very large lexicon tables, but saw no statistically significant change in BLEU. Perhaps this is not surprising, because in Arabic-English translation (unlike Chinese-English translation), the source language is morphologically richer than the target language. So we may benefit from features that preserve this information, while smoothing over morphological differences blurs important distinctions."]},{"title":"4 Conditioning on provenance","paragraphs":["Typical machine translation systems are trained on a fixed set of training data ranging over a variety of genres, and if the genre of an input sentence is known in advance, it is usually advantageous to use model parameters tuned for that genre.","Consider the following Arabic sentence, from a weblog (words written left-to-right):","(10) لعلو wlEl perhaps اذھ h*A this دحا AHd one مھا Ahm main قورفلا Alfrwq differences نیب byn between روص Swr images ةمظنا AnZmp systems مكحلا AlHkm ruling ةحرتقملا AlmqtrHp proposed . . .","(11) Human: Perhaps this is one of the most important differences between the images of the proposed ruling systems.","(12) MT (baseline): This may be one of the most important differences between pictures of the proposed ruling regimes.","(13) MT (better): Perhaps this is one of the most important differences between the images of the proposed regimes. The Arabic word لعلو can be translated as may or perhaps (among others), with the latter more common according to t(e | f ), as shown in Table 3. But some genres favor perhaps more or less strongly. Thus, both translations (12) and (13) are good, but the latter uses a slightly more informal register appropriate to the genre.","Following Matsoukas et al. (2009), we assign each training sentence pair a set of binary features which we call s-features:","t(e | f ) ts(e | f ) f e – nw web bn un لعلو may 0.13 0.12 0.16 0.09 0.13 لعلو perhaps 0.20 0.23 0.32 0.42 0.19 Table 3: Different genres have different preferences for word translations. Key: nw = newswire, web = Web, bn = broadcast news, un = United Nations proceedings.","• Whether the sentence pair came from a particular genre, for example, newswire or web","• Whether the sentence pair came from a particular collection, for example, FBIS or UN","Matsoukas et al. (2009) use these s-features to compute weights for each training sentence pair, which are in turn used for computing various model features. They found that the sentence-level weights were most helpful for computing the lexical weighting features (p.c.). The mapping from s-features to sentence weights was chosen to optimize expected TER on held-out data. A drawback of this method is that we must now learn the mapping from s-features to sentence-weights and then the model feature weights. Therefore, we tried an alternative that incorporates s-features into the model itself.","For each s-feature s, we compute new word translation tables ts(e | f ) and ts( f | e) estimated from only those sentence pairsf on which s fires, and extend them to phrases/rules as before. The idea is to use these probabilities as new features in the model. However, two challenges arise: first, many word pairs are unseen for a given s, resulting in zero or undefined probabilities; second, this adds many new features for each rule, which requires a lot of space.","To address the problem of unseen word pairs, we use Witten-Bell smoothing (Witten and Bell, 1991): t̂s(e | f ) = λ f sts(e | f ) + (1 − λ f s)t(e | f ) (14) λ f s =","c( f, s) c( f, s) + d( f, s) (15) where c( f, s) is the number of times f has been observed in sentences with s-feature s, and d( f, s) is the number of e types observed aligned to f in sentences with s-feature s.","For each s-feature s, we add two model features − log t̂s(ē | f̄ ) t(ē | f̄ ) and − log t̂s( f̄ | ē) t( f̄ | ē) 457","Arabic-English Chinese-English","newswire web newswire web","system features Dev Test Dev Test Dev Test Dev Test","string-to-string baseline 47.1 43.8 37.1 38.4 28.7 26.0 23.2 25.9 full2","47.7 44.2∗","37.4 39.0 29.5 26.8 23.8 26.3","string-to-tree baseline 47.3 43.6 37.7 39.6 29.2 26.4 23.0 26.0 full 47.7 44.3 38.3 40.2 29.8 27.1 23.4 26.6 Table 4: Our variations on lexical weighting improve translation quality significantly across 16 different test conditions. All improvements are significant at the p < 0.01 level, except where marked with an asterisk (∗","), indicating p < 0.05. In order to address the space problem, we use the following heuristic: for any given rule, if the absolute value of one of these features is less than log 2, we discard it for that rule."]},{"title":"5 Experiments Setup","paragraphs":["We tested these features on two machine translation systems: a hierarchical phrase-based (string-to-string) system (Chiang, 2005) and a syntax-based (string-to-tree) system (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006). For Arabic-English translation, both systems were trained on 190+220 million words of parallel data; for Chinese-English, the string-to-string system was trained on 240+260 million words of parallel data, and the string-to-tree system, 58+65 million words. Both used two language models, one trained on the combined English sides of the Arabic-English and Chinese-English data, and one trained on 4 billion words of English data.","The baseline string-to-string system already incorporates some simple provenance features: for each s-feature s, there is a feature P(s | rule). Both baseline also include a variety of other features (Chiang et al., 2008; Chiang et al., 2009; Chiang, 2010).","Both systems were trained using MIRA (Crammer et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008) on a held-out set, then tested on two more sets (Dev and Test) disjoint from the data used for rule extraction and for MIRA training. These datasets have roughly 1000–3000 sentences (30,000–70,000 words) and are drawn from test sets from the NIST MT evaluation and development sets from the GALE program. Individual tests We first tested morphological smoothing using the string-to-string system on Chinese-English translation. The morphologically smoothed system generated the improved translation (8) above, and generally gave a small improvement:","task features Dev","Chi-Eng nw baseline 28.7","morph 29.1 We then tested the provenance-conditioned features on both Arabic-English and Chinese-English, again using the string-to-string system: task features Dev Ara-Eng nw baseline 47.1","(Matsoukas et al., 2009) 47.3","provenance2","47.7 Chi-Eng nw baseline 28.7","provenance2","29.4 The translations (12) and (13) come from the Arabic-English baseline and provenance systems. For Arabic-English, we also compared against lexical weighting features that use sentence weights kindly provided to us by Matsoukas et al. Our features performed better, although it should be noted that those sentence weights had been optimized for a different translation model. Combined tests Finally, we tested the features across a wider range of tasks. For Chinese-English translation, we combined the morphologically-smoothed and provenance-conditioned lexical weighting features; for Arabic-English, we continued to use only the provenance-conditioned features. We tested using both systems, and on both newswire and web genres. The results are shown in Table 4. The features produce statistically significant improvements across all 16 conditions.","2","In these systems, an error crippled the t( f | e), tm( f | e), and ts( f | e) features.

Below are corpora more helpful for newswire translation, like LDC2005T06 (Chinese News Translation Text Part 1)."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Many different approaches to morphology and provenance in machine translation are possible. We have chosen to implement our approach as extensions to lexical weighting (Koehn et al., 2003), which is nearly ubiquitous, because it is defined at the level of word alignments. For this reason, the features we have introduced should be easily applicable to a wide range of phrase-based, hierarchical phrase-based, and syntax-based systems. While the improvements obtained using them are not enormous, we have demonstrated that they help significantly across many different conditions, and over very strong baselines. We therefore fully expect that these new features would yield similar improvements in other systems as well."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Spyros Matsoukas and colleagues at BBN for providing their sentence-level weights and important insights into their corpus-weighting work.
