In a hidden semi-Markov model, word-to-phrase and phrase-to-word translations are modeled directly by the system. Agreement between two directional models encourages the selection of par-simonious phrasal alignments, avoiding the overfitting commonly encountered in unsupervised training with multi-word units. Expanding the state space to include “gappy phrases” (such as French ne ⋆ pas) makes the alignment space more symmetric; thus, it allows agreement between discontinuous alignments.

Alignment is also used in various other NLP problems such as entailment, paraphrasing, question answering, summarization and spelling correction.","A limitation to word-based alignment is undesirable. As seen in the French-English example in Figure 1, many sentence pairs are naturally aligned with multi-word units in both languages (chemin de fer; would ⋆ like, where ⋆ indicates a gap). Much work has addressed this problem: generative models for direct phrasal alignment (Marcu and Wong, 2002), heuristic word-alignment combinations (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2003), models with pseudo-word collocations (Lambert and Banchs, 2006; Ma et al., 2007; Duan et al., 2010), synchronous gram-mar based approaches (Wu, 1997), etc. Most have a large state-space, using constraints and approximations for efficient inference.","We present a new phrasal alignment model based on the hidden Markov framework (Vogel et al., 1996). Our approach is semi-Markov: each state can generate multiple observations, representing word-to-phrase alignments. We also augment the state space to include contiguous sequences. This corresponds to phrase-to-word and phrase-to-phrase alignments. We generalize alignment by agreement (Liang et al., 2006) to this space, and find that agreement discourages EM from overfitting. Finally, we make the alignment space more symmetric by including gappy (or non-contiguous) phrases.

Prun-ing the set of allowed phrases preserves the time complexity of the word-to-word HMM alignment model. 1.1 Related Work Our first major influence is that of conditional phrase-based models. An early approach by Deng and Byrne (2005) changed the parameterization of the traditional word-based HMM model, modeling subsequent words from the same state using a bigram model. However, this model changes only the parameterization and not the set of possible alignments. More closely related are the approaches of Daumé III and Marcu (2004) and DeNero et al. (2006), which allow phrase-to-phrase alignments between the source and target domain. As DeNero warns, though, an unconstrained model may overfit using unusual segmentations. Interestingly, the phrase-based hidden semi-Markov model of Andrés-Ferrer and Juan (2009) does not seem to encounter these problems. We suspect two main causes: first, the model interpolates with Model 1 (Brown et al., 1994), which may help prevent overfitting, and second, the model is monotonic, which screens out many possible alignments. Monotonicity is generally undesirable, though: almost all parallel sentences exhibit some reordering phenomena, even when languages are syntactically very similar.","The second major inspiration is alignment by agreement by Liang et al. (2006). Here, soft intersection between the forward (F→E) and backward (E→F) alignments during parameter estimation produces better word-to-word correspondences. This unsupervised approach produced alignments with incredibly low error rates on French-English, though only moderate gains in end-to-end machine translation results. Likely this is because the symmetric portion of the HMM space contains only single word to single word links. As shown in Figure 2, in order to retain the phrasal link f1 ∼ e1, e2 after agreement, we need the reverse phrasal link e1, e2 ∽ f1 in the backward direction. However, this is not possible in a word-based HMM where each observation must be generated by a single state. Agreement tends to encourage 1-to-1 alignments with very high precision and but lower recall. As each word alignment acts as a constraint on phrase extraction, the phrase-pairs obtained from those alignments have high recall and low precision."]},{"title":"2 Gappy Phrasal Alignment","paragraphs":["Our goal is to unify phrasal alignment and alignment by agreement. We use a phrasal hidden semi-Markov alignment model, but without the monotonicity requirement of Andrés-Ferrer and Juan (2009). Since phrases may be used in both the state and observation space of both sentences, agreement during EM training no longer penalizes phrasal links such as those in Figure 2. Moreover, the benefits of agreement are preserved: meaningful phrasal links that are likely in both directions of alignment will be reinforced, while phrasal links likely in only one direction will be discouraged. This avoids segmentation problems encountered by DeNero et al. (2006).","Non-contiguous sequences of words present an additional challenge. Even a semi-Markov model with phrases can represent the alignment between English not and French ne ⋆ pas in one direction only. To make the model more symmetric, we extend the state space to include gappy phrases as well.1","The set of alignments in each model becomes symmetric, though the two directions model gappy phrases differently.

Computing posteriors for agreement is somewhat complicated, so we resort to an approximation described later. Exact inference retains a low-order polynomial runtime; we use pruning to in-crease speed. 2.1 Hidden Markov Alignment Models Our model can be seen as an extension of the standard word-based Hidden Markov Model (HMM) used in alignment (Vogel et al., 1996). To ground the discussion, we first review the structure of that model. This generative model has the form p(O|S) =","∑","A p(A, O|S), where S = (s1, . . . , sI ) ∈ Σ⋆","is a sequence of words from a vocabulary Σ; O = (o1, . . . , oJ ) ∈ Π⋆","is a sequence from vocabulary Π; and A = (a1, . . . , aJ ) is the alignment between the two sequences. Since some words are systematically inserted during translation, the target (state) word sequence is augmented with a special NULL word. To retain the position of the last aligned word, the state space contains I copies of the NULL word, one for each position (Och and Ney, 2003). The alignment uses positive positions for words and negative positions for NULL states, so aj ∈ {1..I} ∪ {−1.. − I}, and si = NULL if i < 0.","It uses the following generative procedure. First the length of the observation sequence is selected based on pl(J |I). Then for each observation position, the state is selected based on the prior state: a null state with probability p0, or a non-null state at position aj with probability (1 − p0) · pj(aj|aj−1) where pj is a jump distribution. Finally the observation word oj at that position is generated with probability pt(oj|saj ), where pt is an emission distribution: p(A, O|S) = pl(J |I) J ∏ j=1 pj(aj|aj−1)pt(oj|saj )","pj(a|a′ ) = {","(1 − p0) · pd(a − |a′","|) a > 0","p0 · δ(|a|, |a′","|) a < 0 We pick p0 using grid search on the development set, pl is uniform, and the pj and pt are optimized by EM.2 2.2 Gappy Semi-Markov Models The HMM alignment model identifies a word-to-word correspondence between the observation 2 Note that jump distances beyond -10 or 10 share a single","parameter to prevent sparsity. 1310 words and the state words. We make two changes to expand this model. First, we allow contiguous phrases on the observation side, which makes the model semi-Markov: at each time stamp, the model may emit more than one observation word. Next, we also allow contiguous and gappy phrases on the state side, leading to an alignment model that can retain phrasal links after agreement (see Section 4).","The S and O random variables are unchanged. Since a single state may generate multiple observation words, we add a new variable K representing the number of states. K should be less than J , the number of observations. The alignment variable is augmented to allow contiguous and non-contiguous ranges of words. We allow only a single gap, but of unlimited length. The null state is still present, and is again represented by negative numbers. A =(a1, . . . , aK ) ∈ A(I) A(I) ={(i1, i2, g)|0 < i1 ≤ i2 ≤ I, g ∈ {GAP, CONTIG}}∪ {(−i, −i, CONTIG) | 0 < i ≤ I} We add one more random variable to capture the total number of observations generated by each state. L ∈ {(l0, l1, . . . , lK ) | 0 = l0 < · · · < lK = J } The generative model takes the following form: p(A, L, O|S) =pl(J |I)pf (K|J ) K ∏ k=1 pj(ak|ak−1)·","pt(lk, olk lk−1+1|S[ak], lk−1) First, the length of the observation sequence (J ) is selected, based on the number of words in the state-side sentence (I). Since it does not affect the alignment, pl is modeled as a uniform distribution. Next, we pick the total number of states to use (K), which must be less than the number of observations (J ). Short state sequences receive an exponential penalty: pf (K|J ) ∝ η(J−K)","if 0 ≤ K ≤ J , or 0 otherwise. A harsh penalty (small positive value of η) may prevent the systematic overuse of phrases.3 3","We found that this penalty was crucial to prevent overfitting in independent training. Joint training with agreement made it basically unnecessary.","Next we decide the assignment of each state. We retain the first-order Markov assumption: the selection of each state is conditioned only on the prior state. The transition distribution is identical to the word-based HMM for single word states. For phrasal and gappy states, we jump into the first word of that state, and out of the last word of that state, and then pay a cost according to how many words are covered within that state. If a = (i1, i2, g), then the beginning word of a is F (a) = i1, the end-ing word is L(a) = i2, and the length N (a) is 2 for gapped states, 0 for null states, and last(a) − f irst(a) + 1 for all others. The transition probability is:","pj(a|a′ ) =   ","p0 · δ(|F (a)|, |L(a′ )|) if F (a) < 0","(1 − p0)pd(F (a) − |L(a′",")|)· pn(N (a)) otherwise where pn(c) ∝ κc","is an exponential distribution. As in the word HMM case, we use a mixture parameter p0 to determine the likelihood of landing in a NULL state. The position of that NULL state remembers the last position of the prior state. For non-null words, we pick the first word of the state according to the distance from the last word of the prior state. Finally, we pick a length for that final state according to an exponential distribution: values of κ less than one will penalize the use of phrasal states.","For each set of state words, we maintain an emission distribution over observation word sequences. Let S[a] be the set of state words referred to by the alignment variable a. For example, the English given French alignment of Figure 3 includes the following state word sets: S[(2, 2, CONTIG)] = voudrais S[(1, 3, GAP)] = ne ⋆ pas S[(6, 8, CONTIG)] = chemin de fer For the emission distribution we keep a multinomial over observation phrases for each set of state words:","p(l, ol","l′|S[a], l′",") ∝ c(ol","l′|S[a]) In contrast to the approach of Deng and Byrne (2005), this encourages greater consistency across instances, and more closely resembles the commonly used phrasal translation models. 1311 We note in passing that pf (K|J ) may be moved","inside the product: pf (K|J ) ∝ η(J−K)","=","∏K k=1 η(lk−lk−1−1)",". The following form derived us-","ing the above rearrangement is helpful during EM. p(A, L, O|S) ∝ K ∏ k=1 pj(ak|ak−1)· pt(lk, olk","lk−1+1|S[ak], lk−1)· η(lk−lk−1−1) where lk − lk−1 − 1 is the length of the observation phrase emitted by state S[ak]. 2.3 Minimality At alignment time we focus on finding the minimal phrase pairs, under the assumption that composed phrase pairs can be extracted in terms of these minimal pairs. We are rather strict about this, allowing only 1 → k and k → 1 phrasal alignment edges (or links). This should not cause undue stress, since edges of the form 2 − 3 (say e1e2 ∼ f1f2f3) can generally be decomposed into 1 − 1 ∪ 1 − 2 (i.e., e1 ∼ f1 ∪ e2 ∼ f2f3), etc. However, the model does not require this to be true: we will describe reestimation for unconstrained general models, but use the limited form for word alignment."]},{"title":"3 Parameter Estimation","paragraphs":["We use Expectation-Maximization (EM) to estimate parameters. The forward-backward algorithm efficiently computes posteriors of transitions and emissions in the word-based HMM. In a standard HMM, emission always advances the observation position by one, and the next transition is unaffected by the emission. Neither of these assumptions hold in our model: multiple observations may be emitted at a time, and a state may cover multiple state-side words, which affects the outgoing transition. A modified dynamic program computes posteriors for this generalized model.","The following formulation of the forward-backward algorithm for word-to-word alignment is a good starting point. α[x, 0, y] indicates the total mass of paths that have just transitioned into state y at observation x but have not yet emitted; α[x, 1, y] represents the mass after emission but before subsequent transition. β is defined similarly.

(2006), letting q be a product of marginals: E : q(z; x) := ∏ z∈z p1(z|x; θ1)p2(z|x; θ2) where each pk(z|x; θk) is the posterior marginal of some edge z according to each model. Such a heuristic E step computes the marginals for each model separately, then multiplies the marginals corresponding to the same edge. This product of marginals acts as the approximation to the posterior used in the M step for each model. The intuition is that if the two models disagree on a certain edge z, then the marginal product is small, hence that edge is dis-preferred in each model.","Contiguous phrase agreement. It is simple to extend agreement to alignments in the absence of gaps. Multi-word (phrasal) links are assigned some posterior probability in both models, as shown in the example in Figure 3, and we multiply the posteriors of these phrasal links just as in the single word case.4 γF →E(fi, ej) := γE→F (ej, fi) := [γF →E(fi, ej) × γE→F (ej, fi)]","4","Phrasal correspondences can be represented in multiple ways: multiple adjacent words could be generated from the same state either using one semi-Markov emission, or using multiple single word emissions followed by self-jumps. Only the first case is reinforced through agreement, so the latter is implicitly discouraged. We explored an option to forbid same-state transitions, but found it made little difference in practice.","Gappy phrase agreement. When we introduce gappy phrasal states, agreement becomes more challenging. In the forward direction F→E, if we have a gappy state aligned to an observation, say fi ⋆ fj ∼ ek, then its corresponding edge in the backward direction E→F would be ek ∽ fi ⋆ fj. However, this is represented by two distinct and unrelated emissions. Although it is possible the compute the posterior probability of two non-adjacent emissions, this requires running a separate dynamic program for each such combination to sum the mass between these emissions. For the sake of efficiency we resort to an approximate computation of posterior marginals using the two word-to-word edges ek ∽ fi and ek ∽ fj.","The forward posterior γF →E for edge fi ⋆ fj ∼ ek is multiplied with the min of the backward posteriors of the edges ek ∽ fi and ek ∽ fj. γF →E(fi ⋆ fj, ek) := γF →E(fi ⋆ fj, ek)× min { γE→F (ek, fi), γE→F (ek, fj)} Note that this min is an upper bound on the desired posterior of edge ek ∽ fi ⋆ fj, since every path that passes through ek ∽ fi and ek ∽ fj must pass through ek ∽ fi, therefore the posterior of ek ∽ fi ⋆ fj is less than that of ek ∽ fi, and likewise less than that of ek ∽ fj.","The backward posteriors of the edges ek ∽ fi and ek ∽ fj are also mixed with the forward posteriors of the edges to which they correspond. γE→F (ek, fi) := γE→F (ek, fi) × [ γF →E(fi, ek)+ ∑ h<i<j { γF →E(fh ⋆ fi, ek) + γF →E(fi ⋆ fj, ek) }]"]},{"title":"5 Pruned Lists of ‘Allowed’ Phrases","paragraphs":["To identify contiguous and gapped phrases that are more likely to lead to good alignments, we use word-to-word HMM alignments from the full training data in both directions (F→E and E→F).

For French-English, we use the Hansards NAACL 2003 shared-task dataset, which contains nearly 1.1 million training sentence pairs. We also evaluated on German-English Europarl data from WMT2010, with nearly 1.6 million training sentence pairs. The model from Liang et al. (2006) is our word-based baseline. 7.1 Training Regimen Our training regimen begins with both the forward (F→E) and backward (E→F) iterations of Model 1 run independently (i.e. without agreement). Next, we train several iterations of the forward and backward word-to-word HMMs, again with independent training. We do not use agreement during word alignment since it tends to produce sparse 1-1 alignments, which in turn leads to low phrase emission probabilities in the gappy model.","Initializing the emission probabilities of the semi-Markov model is somewhat complicated, since the word-based models do not assign any mass to the phrasal or gapped configurations. Therefore we use a heuristic method. We first retrieve the Viterbi alignments of the forward and backward 1314 word-to-word HMM aligners. For phrasal correspondences, we combine these forward and backward Viterbi alignments using a common heuristic (Union, Intersection, Refined, or Grow-Diag-Final), and extract tight phrase-pairs (no unaligned words on the boundary) from this alignment set. We found that Grow-Diag-Final was most effective in our experiments. The counts gathered from this phrase extraction are used to initialize phrasal translation probabilities. For gappy states in a forward (F→E) model, we use alignments from the backward (E→F) model. If a state sk is aligned to two non-consecutive observations oi and oj such that sk is not aligned to any other observation, and at least one observation between oi and oj is aligned to a non-null state other than sk, then we reverse this link to get oi ⋆ oj ∼ sk and use it as a gapped-state-phrase instance for adding fractional counts. Given these approximate fractional counts, we per-form a standard MLE M-step to initialize the emission probability distributions. The distortion probabilities from the word-based model are used without changes. 7.2 Alignment Results (F1) The validation and test sentences have been hand-aligned (see Och and Ney (2003)) and are marked with both sure and possible alignments.

Note that by setting η and κ to one, we have effectively removed the penalty altogether without affecting our results. In Table 1 we see a consistent improvement with the addition of contiguous phrases, and some additional gains with gappy phrases. 7.3 Translation Results (BLEU) We assembled a phrase-based system from the alignments (using only contiguous phrases consistent with the potentially gappy alignment), with 4 channel models, word and phrase count features, distortion penalty, lexicalized reordering model, and a 5-gram language model, weighted by MERT. The same free parameters from above were tuned to optimize development set BLEU using grid search. The improvements in Table 2 are encouraging, especially as a syntax-based or non-contiguous phrasal system (Galley and Manning, 2010) may benefit more from gappy phrases."]},{"title":"8 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["We have described an algorithm for efficient unsupervised alignment of phrases.

We also allow gappy (non-contiguous) phrases on the state side, which makes agreement more successful but agreement needs approximation of posterior marginals. Using pruned lists of good phrases, we maintain complexity equal to the baseline word-to-word model.","There are several steps forward from this point. Limiting the gap length also prevents combinatorial explosion; we hope to explore this in future work. Clearly a translation system that uses discontinuous mappings at runtime (Chiang, 2007; Galley and Manning, 2010) may make better use of discontinuous alignments. This model can also be applied at the morpheme or character level, allowing joint inference of segmentation and alignment. Furthermore the state space could be expanded and enhanced to include more possibilities: states with multiple gaps might be useful for alignment in languages with template morphology, such as Arabic or Hebrew. More exploration in the model space could be useful – a better distortion model might place a stronger distribution on the likely starting and end-ing points of phrases."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful suggestions.
