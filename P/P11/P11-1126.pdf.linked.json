Consensus decoding, on the other hand, can be based on either single or multiple systems: single system based methods (Kumar and Byrne, 2004; Tromble et al., 2008; DeNero et al., 2009; Kumar et al., 2009) re-rank translations produced by a single SMT model using either n-gram posteriors or expected n-gram counts. Because hypotheses generated by a single model are highly correlated, improvements obtained are usually small; recently, dedicated efforts have been made to extend it from single system to multiple systems (Li et al., 2009a; DeNero et al., 2010; Duan et al., 2010). Such methods select translations by optimizing consensus models over the combined hypotheses using all component systems’ posterior distributions.","Although these two types of approaches have shown consistent improvements over the standard Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) decoding scheme, most of them are implemented as post-processing procedures over translations generated by MAP decoders. In this sense, the work of Li et al. (2009a) is different in that both partial and full hypotheses are re-ranked during the decoding phase directly using consensus between translations from different SMT systems. However, their method does not change component systems’ search spaces.","This paper presents hypothesis mixture decoding (HM decoding), a new decoding scheme that performs translation reconstruction using hypotheses generated by multiple component systems. HM decoding involves two decoding stages: first, each component system decodes the source sentence independently, with the explored search space kept for use in the next step; second, a new search space is constructed by composing existing hypo-1258  theses produced by all component systems using a set of rules provided by the HM decoder itself, and a new set of component model independent features are used to seek the final best translation from this new constructed search space.","We evaluate by combining two SMT models with state-of-the-art performances on the NIST Chinese-to-English translation tasks. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the best component SMT system by up to 2.11 BLEU points. Consistent improvements can be observed over several related decoding techniques as well, including word-level system combination, collaborative decoding and model combination."]},{"title":"2 Hypothesis Mixture Decoding 2.1 Motivation and Overview","paragraphs":["SMT models based on different paradigms have emerged in the last decade using fairly different levels of linguistic knowledge. Motivated by the success of system combination research, the key contribution of this work is to make more effective use of the extended search spaces from different SMT models in decoding phase directly, rather than just post-processing their final outputs. We first begin with a brief review of single system based SMT decoding, and then illustrate major challenges to this end.","Given a source sentence , an SMT decoder seeks for a target translation that best matches as its translation by maximizing the following conditional probability:  ","","  where is the feature vector that includes a set of system specific features, is the weight vector, is a derivation that can yield and is defined as a sequence of translation rule applications . Figure 1 illustrates a decoding example, in which the final translation is generated by recursively composing partial hypotheses that cover different ranges of the source sentence until the whole input sentence is fully covered, and the feature vector of the final translation is the aggregation of feature vectors of all partial hypotheses used.1","","However, hypotheses generated by different SMT systems cannot be combined directly to form new translations because of two major issues:","The first one is the heterogeneous structures of different SMT models. For example, a string-to-tree system cannot use hypotheses generated by a phrase-based system in decoding procedure, as such hypotheses are based on flat structures, which cannot provide any additional information needed in the syntactic model.","The second one is the incompatible feature spaces of different SMT models. For example, even if a phrase-based system can use the lexical forms of hypotheses generated by a syntax-based system without considering syntactic structures, the feature vectors of these hypotheses still cannot be aggregated together in any trivial way, because the feature sets of SMT models based on different paradigms are usually inconsistent.","To address these two issues discussed above, we propose HM decoding that performs translation reconstruction using hypotheses generated by multiple component systems. 2","Our method involves two decoding stages depicted as follows:","1. Independent decoding stage, in which each component system decodes input sentences independently based on its own model and search algorithm, and the explored search spaces (translation forests) are kept for use in the next stage. 1 There are also features independent of translation derivations, such as the language model feature. 2 In this paper, we will constrain our discussions within CKY-style decoders, in which we find translations for all spans of the source sentence. Although standard implementations of phrase-based decoders fall out of this scope, they can be still re-written to work in the CKY-style bottom-up manner at the cost of 1) only BTG-style reordering allowed, and 2) higher time complexity. As a result, any phrase-based SMT system can be used as a component in our HM decoding method.","China ’s economic growth [-2.48, 4]  China [-0.36, 1] 的 中国 经济 发展","’s [-0.69, 1] economic [-0.51, 1] growth [-0.92, 1] China ‘s [-1.05, 2]","economic growth [-1.43, 2] Figure 1: A decoding example of a phrase-based SMT system. Each hypothesis is annotated with a feature vector, which includes a logarithmic probability feature and a word count feature. 1259  ","2. HM decoding stage, where a mixture search space is constructed for translation derivations by composing partial hypotheses generated by all component systems, and a new decoding model with a set of enriched feature functions are used to seek final translations from this newly generated search space.","HM decoding can use lexicalized hypotheses of arbitrary SMT models to derive translation, and a set of component model independent features are used to compute translation confidence. We discuss mixture search space construction, details of model and feature designs as well as HM decoding algorithms in Section 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. 2.2 Mixture Search Space Construction Let denote component MT systems,  ","denote the span of a source sentence starting at position and ending at position . We use   denoting the search space of  predicted by , and  denoting the mixture search space of ","constructed by the HM decoder, which is defined recursively as follows:    ",". This rule adds all component systems’ search spaces into the mixture search space for use in HM decoding. Thus hypotheses produced by all component systems are still available to the HM decoder.     , in which and ",". is a translation rule provided by HM decoder that composes a new hypothesis using smaller hypotheses in the search spaces  . These rules further extend ","with hypotheses generated by the HM decoder itself.","Figure 2 shows an example of HM decoding, in which hypotheses generated by two SMT systems are used together to compose new translations. Since search space pruning is the indispensable procedure for all SMT systems, we will omit its explicit expression in the following descriptions and algorithms for convenience. 2.3 Models and Features Following the common practice in SMT research, we use a linear model to formulate the preference of translation hypotheses in the mixture search space . Formally, we are to find a translation that maximizes the weighted linear combination of a set of real-valued features as follows:"," ","   where is an HM decoding feature with its corresponding feature weight .","In this paper, the HM decoder does not assume the availability of any internal knowledge of the underlying component systems. The HM decoding features are independent of component models as well, which fall into two categories:","The first category contains a set of consensus-based features, which are inspired by the success of consensus decoding approaches. These features are described in details as follows:","1) : the n-gram posterior feature of computed based on the component search space generated by :","   ","","is the posterior probability of an n-gram in , is the number of times that occurs in , equals to 1 when occurs in , and 0 otherwise.

A word stem dictionary that includes 22,660 entries is used to convert and into their stem forms ","and","by replacing each word into its stem form.

We leverage consensus features based on the mixture search space newly generated in HM decoding as well. The length posterior feature (Zen and Ney, 2006) is used to adjust the preference of HM decoder for longer or shorter translations, and the stemmed n-gram posterior features are used to provide more discriminative power for HM decoding and to decrease the effects of morphological changes in words for more accurate computation of consensus statistics.","The second feature category contains a set of general features. Although there are more features that can be incorporated into HM decoding besides the ones we list below, we only utilize the most representative ones for convenience: 1) : the word count feature. 2) : the language model feature.","3) : the dictionary-based feature that counts how many lexicon pairs can be found in a given translation pair .","4) and : reordering features that penalize the uses of straight and inverted BTG rules during the derivation of in HM decoding. These two features are specific to BTG-based HM decoding (Section 2.4.1):","  ","  ","5) and : reordering features that penalize the uses of hierarchical and glue rules during the derivation of in HM decoding. These two features are specific to SCFG-based HM decoding (Section 2.4.2):","  ","   is the hierarchical rule set provided by the HM decoder itself, equals to 1 when is provided by , and 0 otherwise.","6) : the feature that counts how many n-grams in are newly generated by the HM decoder, which cannot be found in all existing component search spaces:     ","","equals to 1 when does","not exist in",", and 0 otherwise.","The MERT algorithm (Och, 2003) is used to tune weights of HM decoding features. 2.4 Decoding Algorithms Two CKY-style algorithms for HM decoding are presented in this subsection. The first one is based on BTG (Wu, 1997), and the second one is based on SCFG, similar to Chiang (2005). 1261  2.4.1 BTG-based HM Decoding The first algorithm, BTG-HMD, is presented in Algorithm 1, where hypotheses of two consecutive source spans are composed using two BTG rules:"," Straight rule . It combines translations of two consecutive blocks into a single larger block in a straight order."," Inverted rule . It combines translations of two consecutive blocks into a single larger block in an inverted order. These two rules are used bottom-up until the whole source sentence is fully covered. We use two reordering rule penalty features, and , to penalize the uses of these two rules.

We compute HM decoding features for hypotheses contained in all existing component search spaces   ","as well, and add them to ",". From line 17 to 20, we update current HM decoding scores for all hypotheses in ","using the n-gram and length posterior features computed based on ",". When the whole source sentence is fully covered, we return the hypothesis with the maximum model score as the final best translation. 2.4.2 SCFG-based HM Decoding The second algorithm, SCFG-HMD, is presented in Algorithm 2. An additional rule set , which is provided by the HM decoder, is used to compose hypotheses. It includes hierarchical rules extracted using Chiang (2005)’s method and glue rules. Two reordering rule penalty features, and , are used to adjust the preferences of using hierarchical rules and glue rules.

(2010) presents a similar method, which utilizes a mixture model to combine distributions of hypotheses from different systems for Bayes-risk computation, and selects final translations from the combined search spaces using MBR decoding. Both of these two methods share a common limitation: they only re-rank the combined search space, without the capability to generate new translations. In contrast, by reusing hypotheses generated by all component systems in HM decoding, translations beyond any existing search space can be generated. 3.2 Co-Decoding and Joint Decoding Li et al. (2009a) proposes collaborative decoding, an approach that combines translation systems by re-ranking partial and full translations iteratively using n-gram features from the predictions of other member systems. However, in co-decoding, all member systems must work in a synchronous way, and hypotheses between different systems cannot be shared during decoding procedure; Liu et al. (2009) proposes joint-decoding, in which multiple SMT models are combined in either translation or derivation levels. However, their method relies on the correspondence between nodes in hypergraph outputs of different models. HM decoding, on the other hand, can use hypotheses from component search spaces directly without any restriction. 3.3 Hybrid Decoding Hybrid decoding (Cui et al., 2010) resembles our approach in the motivation. This method uses the system combination technique in decoding directly to combine partial hypotheses from different SMT models. However, confusion network construction brings high computational complexity. What’s more, partial hypotheses generated by confusion network decoding cannot be assigned exact feature values for future use in higher level decoding, and they only use feature values of 1-best hypothesis as an approximation. HM decoding, on the other hand, leverages a set of enriched features, which are computable for all the hypotheses generated by either component systems or the HM decoder."]},{"title":"4 Experiments 4.1 Data and Metric","paragraphs":["Experiments are conducted on the NIST Chinese-to-English MT tasks. The NIST 2004 (MT04) data set is used as the development set, and evaluation results are reported on the NIST 2005 (MT05), the newswire portions of the NIST 2006 (MT06) and 2008 (MT08) data sets. All bilingual corpora available for the NIST 2008 constrained data track of Chinese-to-English MT task are used as training data, which contain 5.1M sentence pairs, 128M Chinese words and 147M English words after preprocessing.

A phrase-based system (Xiong et al., 2006) with one lexicalized reordering model based on the maximum entropy principle."," DHPB. A string-to-dependency tree-based system (Shen et al., 2008), which translates source strings to target dependency trees.

Reordering model used in PB is trained on the same selected data set as well. A trigram dependency language model used in DHPB is trained with the outputs from Berkeley parser on all language model training data. 4.3 Contrastive Techniques","We compare HM decoding with three multiple-","system based decoding techniques:"," Word-Level System Combination (SC). We re-implement an IHMM alignment based system combination method proposed by Li et al. (2009b). The setting of the N-best candidates used is the same as the original paper."," Co-decoding (CD). We re-implement it based on Li et al. (2009a), with the only difference that only two models are included in our reimplementation, instead of three in theirs. For each test set, co-decoding outputs three results, two for two member systems, and one for the further system combination."," Model Combination (MC). Different from co-decoding, MC produces single one output for each input sentence. We re-implement this method based on DeNero et al. (2010) with two component models included. 4.4 Comparison to Component Systems We compared HM decoding with two component SMT systems first (in Table 2). 30 features are used to annotate each hypothesis in HM decoding, including: 8 n-gram posterior features computed from PB/DHPB forests for ; 8 stemmed n-gram posterior features computed from stemmed PB/DHPB forests for ; 4 n-gram posterior features and 1 length posterior feature computed from the mixture search space of HM decoder for ; 1 LM feature; 1 word count feature; 1 dictionary-based feature; 2 grammar-specified rule penalty features for either BTG-HMD or SCFG-HMD; 4 count features for newly generated n-grams in HM decoding for .

We also notice that BTG-HMD performs slight better than SCFG-HMD on test sets. We think the potential reason is that more reordering rules are used in SCFG-HMD to handle phrase movements than BTG-HMD do; however, current HM decoding model lacks the ability to distinguish the qualities of different rules.","We also investigate on the effects of different HM-decoding features. For the convenience of comparison, we divide them into five categories:"," Set-1. 8 n-gram posterior features based on 2 component search spaces plus 3 commonly used features (1 LM feature, 1 word count feature and 1 dictionary-based feature)."," Set-2. 8 stemmed n-gram posterior features based on 2 stemmed component search spaces."," Set-3. 4 n-gram posterior features and 1 length posterior feature based on the mixture search space of the HM decoder."," Set-4. 2 grammar-specified reordering rule penalty features."," Set-5. 4 count features for unseen n-grams generated by HM decoder itself.","Except for the dictionary-based feature, all the features contained in Set-1 are used by the latest multiple-system based consensus decoding techniques (DeNero et al., 2010; Duan et al., 2010). We use them as the starting point.

In this paper, we compare our HM decoding with the combination method proposed by Li et al. (2009b).
