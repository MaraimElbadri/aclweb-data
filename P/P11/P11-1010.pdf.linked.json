It is an important component in modern information retrieval since DSS can improve the traditional search engines and user experience (Wan et al., 2008; Dean et al., 1999). Traditional search engines accept several terms submitted by a user as a query and return a set of docs that are relevant to the query. However, for those users who are not search experts, it is always difficult to accurately specify some query terms to express their search purposes. Unlike short-query based search, DSS queries by a full (long) document, which allows users to directly submit a page or a document to the search engines as the description of their information needs. Meanwhile, the explosion of information has brought great challenges to traditional methods. For example, Inverted List (IL) which is a primary key-term access method would return a very large set of docs for a query document, which leads to the time-consuming post-processing. Therefore, a new effective algorithm is required.","Hashing methods can perform highly efficient but approximate similarity search, and have gained great success in many applications such as Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) (Ke et al., 2004; Kulis et al., 2009b), near-duplicate data detection (Ke et al., 2004; Manku et al., 2007; Costa et al., 2010), etc. Hashing methods project high-dimensional objects to compact binary codes called fingerprints and make similar fingerprints for similar objects. The similarity search in the Hamming space1","is much more efficient than in the original attribute space (Manku et al., 2007).","Recently, several hashing methods have been proposed. Specifically, SimHash (SH) (Charikar M.S., 2002) uses random projections to hash data. Although it works well with long fingerprints, SH has poor discrimination power for short fingerprints. A kernelized variant of SH, called Kernelized Locality Sensitive Hashing (KLSH) (Kulis et al., 2009a), is proposed to handle non-linearly separable data. These methods are unsupervised thus cannot incorporate prior knowledge for better hashing. Moti-","1","Hamming space is a set of binary strings of length L. 93 vated by this, some supervised methods are proposed to derive effective hash functions from prior knowledge, i.e., Spectral Hashing (Weiss et al., 2009) and Semi-Supervised Hashing (SSH) (Wang et al., 2010a). Regardless of different objectives, both methods derive hash functions via Principle Component Analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe, 1986). However, PCA is computationally expensive, which limits their usage for high-dimensional data.","This paper proposes a novel (semi-)supervised hashing method, Semi-Supervised SimHash (S3","H), for high-dimensional data similarity search. Unlike SSH that tries to find a sequence of hash functions, S3","H fixes the random projection directions and seeks the optimal feature weights from prior knowledge to relocate the objects such that similar objects have similar fingerprints. This is implemented by maximizing the empirical accuracy on the prior knowledge (labeled data) and the entropy of hash functions (estimated over labeled and unlabeled data). The proposed method avoids using PCA which is computationally expensive especially for high-dimensional data, and leads to an efficient Quasi-Newton based solution. To evaluate our method, we compare with several state-of-the-art hashing methods on two large datasets, i.e., 20 Newsgroups (20K points) and Open Directory Project (ODP) (2.4 million points). All experiments show that S3","H gets the best search performance.","This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly introduces the background and some related works. In Section 3, we describe our proposed Semi-Supervised SimHash (S3","H). Section 4 provides experimental validation on two datasets. The conclusions are given in Section 5."]},{"title":"2 Background and Related Works","paragraphs":["Suppose we are given a set of N documents, X = {xi | xi ∈ RM","}N","i=1. For a given query doc q, DSS tries to find its nearest neighbors in X or a subset X ′","⊂ X in which distance from the documents to the query doc q is less than a give threshold. However, such two tasks are computationally infeasible for large-scale data. Thus, it turns to the approximate similarity search problem (Indyk et al., 1998). In this section, we briefly review some related approximate similarity search methods. 2.1 SimHash SimHash (SH) is first proposed by Charikar (Charikar M.S., 2002). SH uses random projections as hash functions, i.e.,","h(x) = sign(wT x) = { +1, if wT","x ≥ 0 −1, otherwise (1) where w ∈ RM","is a vector randomly generated. SH specifies the distribution on a family of hash functions H = {h} such that for two objects xi and xj, Pr h∈H {h(xi) = h(xj)} = 1 −","θ(xi, xj) π (2) where θ(xi, xj) is the angle between xi and xj. Obviously, SH is an unsupervised hashing method. 2.2 Kernelized Locality Sensitive Hashing A kernelized variant of SH, named Kernelized Locality Sensitive Hashing (KLSH) (Kulis et al., 2009a), is proposed for non-linearly separable data. KLSH approximates the underling Gaussian distribution in the implicit embedding space of data based on central limit theory. To calculate the value of hashing fuction h(·), KLSH projects points onto the eigenvectors of the kernel matrix. In short, the complete procedure of KLSH can be summarized as follows: 1) randomly select P (a small value) points from X and form the kernel matrix, 2) for each hash function h(φ(x)), calculate its weight ω ∈ RP","just as Kernel PCA (Schölkopf et al., 1997), and 3) the hash function is defined as:","h(φ(x)) = sign( P ∑ i=1 ωi · κ(x, xi)) (3) where κ(·, ·) can be any kernel function.","KLSH can improve hashing results via the kernel trick. However, KLSH is unsupervised, thus design-ing a data-specific kernel remains a big challenge. 2.3 Semi-Supervised Hashing Semi-Supervised Hashing (SSH) (Wang et al., 2010a) is recently proposed to incorporate prior knowledge for better hashing. Besides X , prior knowledge in the form of similar and dissimilar object-pairs is also required in SSH. SSH tries to find L optimal hash functions which have maximum 94 empirical accuracy on prior knowledge and maximum entropy by finding the top L eigenvectors of an extended covariance matrix2","via PCA or SVD.","However, despite of the potential problems of numerical stability, SVD requires massive computational space and O(M 3",") computational time where M is feature dimension, which limits its usage for high-dimensional data (Trefethen et al., 1997). Furthermore, the variance of directions obtained by PCA decreases with the decrease of the rank (Jolliffe, 1986). Thus, lower hash functions tend to have smaller entropy and larger empirical errors. 2.4 Others Some other related works should be mentioned. A notable method is Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) (Indyk et al., 1998). LSH performs a random linear projection to map similar objects to similar hash codes. However, LSH suffers from the efficiency problem that it tends to generate long codes (Salakhutdinov et al., 2007). LAMP (Mu et al., 2009) considers each hash function as a binary partition problem as in SVMs (Burges, 1998). Spectral Hashing (Weiss et al., 2009) maintains similarity between objects in the reduced Hamming space by minimizing the averaged Hamming distance3","between similar neighbors in the original Euclidean space. However, spectral hashing takes the assump-tion that data should be distributed uniformly, which is always violated in real-world applications."]},{"title":"3 Semi-Supervised SimHash","paragraphs":["In this section, we present our hashing method, named Semi-Supervised SimHash (S3","H). Let X","L =","{(x1, c1) . . . (xu, cu)} be the labeled data, c ∈","{1 . . . C}, x ∈ RM",", and X","U = {xu+1 . . . xN } the unlabeled data. Let X = XL ∪ XU . Given the labeled data XL, we construct two sets, attraction set Θa and repulsion set Θr. Specifically, any pair (xi, xj) ∈ Θa, i, j ≤ u, denotes that xi and xj are in the same class, i.e., ci = cj, while any pair (xi, xj) ∈ Θr, i, j ≤ u, denotes that ci ̸= cj. Unlike 2 The extended covariance matrix is composed of two com-","ponents, one is an unsupervised covariance term and another is","a constraint matrix involving labeled information. 3 Hamming distance is defined as the number of bits that are","different between two binary strings. previews works that attempt to find L optimal hyperplanes, the basic idea of S3","H is to fix L random hyperplanes and to find an optimal feature-weight vector to relocate the objects such that similar objects have similar codes. 3.1 Data Representation Since L random hyperplanes are fixed, we can represent a object x ∈ X as its relative position to these random hyperplanes, i.e., D = Λ · V (4) where the element Vml ∈ {+1, −1, 0} of V indicates that the object x is above, below or just in the l-th hyperplane with respect to the m-th feature, and Λ = diag(|x1|, |x2|, . . . , |xM |) is a diagonal matrix which, to some extent, reflects the distance from x to these hyperplanes. 3.2 Formulation Hashing maps the data set X to an L-dimensional Hamming space for compact representations. If we represent each object as Equation (4), the l-th hash function is then defined as:","hl(x) = ħl(D) = sign(wT dl) (5) where w ∈ RM","is the feature weight to be determined and dl is the l-th column of the matrix D.","Intuitively, the ”contribution” of a specific feature to different classes is different. Therefore, we hope to incorporate this side information in S3","H for better hashing. Inspired by (Madani et al., 2009), we can measure this contribution over XL as in Algorithm 1. Clearly, if objects are represented as the occurrence numbers of features, the output of Algorithm 1 is just the conditional probability Pr(class|feature). Finally, each object (x, c) ∈ XL can be represented as an M × L matrix G: G = diag(ν1,c, ν2,c, . . . , νM,c) · D (6) Note that, one pair (xi, xj) in Θa or Θr corresponds to (Gi, Gj) while (Di, Dj) if we ignore features’ contribution to different classes.","Furthermore, we also hope to maximize the empirical accuracy on the labeled data Θa and Θr and 95","Algorithm 1: Feature Contribution Calculation","for each (x, c) ∈ XL do for each f ∈ x do","νf ← νf + xf ;","νf,c ← νf,c + xf ; end end for each feature f and class c do","νf,c ← ν f,c ν f ; end maximize the entropy of hash functions. So, we define the following objective for ħ(·)s: J(w) = 1 Np L ∑ l=1 { ∑ (xi,xj)∈Θa ħl(xi)ħl(xj) − ∑ (xi,xj)∈Θr ħl(xi)ħl(xj) } + λ1 L ∑ l=1 H(ħl) (7) where Np = |Θa| + |Θr| is the number of attraction and repulsion pairs and λ1 is a tradeoff between two terms. Wang et al. have proven that hash functions with maximum entropy must maximize the variance of the hash values, and vice-versa (Wang et al., 2010b). Thus, H(ħ(·)) can be estimated over the labeled and unlabeled data, XL and XU .","Unfortunately, direct solution for above problem is non-trivial since Equation (7) is not differentiable. Thus, we relax the objective and add an additional regularization term which could effectively avoid overfitting. Finally, we obtain the total objective: L(w) = 1 Np L ∑ l=1 { ∑","(G i,G j)∈Θ","a","ψ(wT g","i,l)ψ(wT g j,l) − ∑","(G i,G j)∈Θ","r","ψ(wT gi,l)ψ(wT","g j,l)} + λ1 2N L ∑ l=1 { u ∑ i=1","ψ2 (wT","g i,l) + N ∑ i=u+1","ψ2 (wT","di,l)} − λ2 2","∥w∥2 2 (8) where gi,l and di,l denote the l-th column of Gi and Di respectively, and ψ(t) is a piece-wise linear function defined as: ψ(t) =    Tg t > Tg t −Tg ≤ t ≤ Tg −Tg t < −Tg (9) This relaxation has a good intuitive explanation. That is, similar objects are desired to not only have the similar fingerprints but also have sufficient large projection magnitudes, while dissimilar objects are desired to not only differ in their fingerprints but also have large projection margin. However, we do not hope that a small fraction of object-pairs with very large projection magnitude or margin dominate the complete model. Thus, a piece-wise linear function ψ(·) is applied in S3","H.","As a result, Equation (8) is a simply unconstrained optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved by a notable Quasi-Newton algorithm, i.e., L-BFGS (Liu et al., 1989). For description simplicity, only attraction set Θa is considered and the extension to repulsion set Θr is straightforward. Thus, the gradient of L(w) is as follows: ∂L(w) ∂w = 1 Np L ∑ l=1 { ∑","(G i, G","j) ∈ Θa,","|wT g i,l| ≤ Tg","ψ(wT gj,l) · gi,l + ∑","(G i, G","j) ∈ Θa,","|wT g j,l| ≤ Tg","ψ(wT g i,l) · gj,l } (10) + λ1 N L ∑ l=1","{ u ∑ i = 1,","|wT g i,l| ≤ Tg","ψ(wT g i,l) · gi,l + N ∑ i = u + 1,","|wT d i,l| ≤ Tg","ψ(wT di,l) · di,l } − λ2w Note that ∂ψ(t)/∂t = 0 when |t| > Tg. 3.3 Fingerprint Generation When we get the optimal weight w∗",", we generate fingerprints for given objects through Equation (5). Then, it tunes to the problem how to efficiently obtain the representation as in Figure 4 for a object. After analysis, we find: 1) hyperplanes are randomly generated and we only need to determine which sides of these hyperplanes the given object lies on, and 2) in real-world applications, objects such as docs are always very sparse. Thus, we can avoid heavy computational demands and efficiently generate fingerprints for objects.","In practice, given an object x, the procedure of generating an L-bit fingerprint is as follows: it maintains an L-dimensional vector initialized to zero. Each feature f ∈ x is firstly mapped to an L-bit hash value by Jenkins Hashing Function4",". Then,","4","http://www.burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html 96","Algorithm 2: Fast Fingerprint Generation","INPUT: x and w∗",";","initialize ← 0, ← 0, , ∈ RL",";","for each f ∈ x do randomly project f to hf ∈ {−1, +1}L","; ← + xf · w∗","f · hf ;","end","for l = 1 to L do","if αl > 0 then","βl ← 1; end end RETURN ; these L bits increment or decrement the L components of the vector by the value xf × w∗","f . After all features processed, the signs of components determine the corresponding bits of the final fingerprint. The complete algorithm is presented in Algorithm 2. 3.4 Algorithmic Analysis This section briefly analyzes the relation between S3","H and some existing methods. For analysis simplicity, we assume ψ(t) = t and ignore the regularization terms. So, Equation (8) can be rewritten as follows:","J(w)S3 H = 1 2","wT [ L ∑ l=1","Γl(Φ+","− Φ−",")ΓT","l ]w (11)","where Φ+ ij equals to 1 when (xi, xj) ∈ Θa otherwise 0, Φ−","ij equals to 1 when (xi, xj) ∈ Θr otherwise 0, and Γl = [g1,l . . . gu,l, du+1,l . . . dN,l]. We denote","∑","l ΓlΦ+","ΓT","l and","∑","l ΓlΦ−","ΓT","l as S+","and S−","respectively. Therefore, maximizing above function","is equivalent to maximizing the following:","J̃(w)S3","H = |wT","S+","w|","|wT","S−","w| (12) Clearly, Equation (12) is analogous to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (Duda et al., 2000) except for the difference: 1) measurement. S3","H uses similarity while LDA uses distance. As a result, the objective function of S3","H is just the reciprocal of LDA’s. 2) embedding space. LDA seeks the best separative direction in the original attribute space. In contrast, S3","H firstly maps data from RM","to RM×L through the following projection function φ(x) = x · [diag(sign(r1)), . . . , diag(sign(rL))] (13) where rl ∈ RM",", l = 1, . . . , L, are L random hyperplanes. Then, in that space (RM×L","), S3","H seeks a direction5","that can best separate the data. From this point of view, it is obvious that the basic SH is a special case of S3","H when w is set to e = [1, 1, . . . , 1]. That is, SH firstly maps the data via φ(·) just as S3","H. But then, SH directly separates the data in that feature space at the direction e. Analogously, we ignore the regularization terms in SSH and rewrite the objective of SSH as: J(W)SSH = 1 2","tr[WT","X(Φ+ − Φ−",")XT","W] (14) where W = [w1, . . . , wL] ∈ RM×L","are L hyperplanes and X = [x1, . . . , xN ]. Maximizing this objective is equivalent to maximizing the following:","J̃(W)SSH = | tr[WT S′+","W]|","| tr[WT S′−","W]| (15)","where S′+","= XΦ+","XT","and S′−","= XΦ−","XT",". Equa-","tion (15) shows that SSH is analogous to Multiple","Discriminant Analysis (MDA) (Duda et al., 2000).","In fact, SSH uses top L best-separative hyperplanes","in the original attribute space found via PCA to hash","the data. Furthermore, we rewrite the projection","function φ(·) in S3","H as: φ(x) = x · [R1, . . . , RL] (16) where Rl = diag(sign(rl)). Each Rl is a mapping from RM","to RM","and corresponds to one embedding space. From this perspective, unlike SSH, S3","H globally seeks a direction that can best separate the data in L different embedding spaces simultaneously."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["We use two datasets 20 Newsgroups and Open Directory Project (ODP) in our experiments.

Similarly to (Wang et al., 2010b; Weiss et al., 2009), for a query document, if no neighbors within the given Hamming radius can be found, it is considered as zero precision. Note that, the precision of IL is the proportion of good neighbors among the whole searched objects.

An overview of ODP is shown in Figure 5. We randomly sample 10% docs as the test set and the remain as the training set. Furthermore, from training set, we randomly generate 800K doc-pairs as Θa, and 1 million doc-pairs as Θr.

S3","H learns the optimal feature weights from prior knowledge to relocate the data such that similar objects have similar fingerprints.

The proposed method leads to a simple Quasi-Newton based solution which is efficient even for very high-dimensional data. Experiments performed on two large datasets have shown that S3","H has better search performance than several state-of-the-art methods."]},{"title":"6 Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We thank Fangtao Li for his insightful suggestions.
