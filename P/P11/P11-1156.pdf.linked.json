With the availability of large-scale annotated corpora such as Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), it is easy to train a high-performance dependency parser using supervised learning methods.","However, current state-of-the-art statistical dependency parsers (McDonald et al., 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Hall et al., 2006) tend to have","∗","Correspondence author: jzhao@nlpr.ia.ac.cn lower accuracies for longer dependencies (McDonald and Nivre, 2007). The length of a dependency from word wi to word wj is simply equal to |i − j|. Longer dependencies typically represent the modifier of the root or the main verb, internal dependencies of longer NPs or PP-attachment in a sentence. Figure 1 shows the F1 score1","relative to the dependency length on the development set by using the graph-based dependency parsers (McDonald et al., 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006). We note that the parsers provide very good results for adjacent dependencies (96.89% for dependency length =1), while the dependency length increases, the accuracies degrade sharply. These longer dependencies are therefore a major opportunity to improve the overall performance of dependency parsing. Usually, these longer dependencies can be parsed dependent on the specific words involved due to the limited range of features (e.g., a verb and its modifiers). Lexical statistics are therefore needed for resolving ambiguous relationships, yet the lexical-ized statistics are sparse and difficult to estimate directly. To solve this problem, some information with different granularity has been investigated. Koo et al. (2008) proposed a semi-supervised dependency parsing by introducing lexical intermediaries at a coarser level than words themselves via a cluster method. This approach, however, ignores the selectional preference for word-to-word interactions, such as head-modifier relationship.

All of our lexical statistics are derived from two kinds of web-scale corpus: one is the web, which is the largest data set that is available for NLP (Keller and Lapata, 2003). Another is a web-scale N-gram corpus, which is a N-gram corpus with N-grams of length 15 (Brants and Franz, 2006), we call it Google V1 in this paper. The idea is very simple: web-scale data have large coverage for word pair acquisition. By leveraging some assistant data, the dependency parsing model can directly utilize the additional information to capture the word-to-word level relationships. We address two natural and related questions which some previous studies leave open:","Question I: Is there a benefit in incorporating web-derived selectional preference features for statistical dependency parsing, especially for longer dependencies?","Question II: How well do web-derived selectional preferences perform on new domains?","For Question I, we systematically assess the value of using web-scale data in state-of-the-art supervised dependency parsers. We compare dependency parsers that include or exclude selectional preference features obtained from web-scale corpus. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing studies directly address long dependencies of dependency parsing by using web-scale data.","Most statistical parsers are highly domain dependent. For example, the parsers trained on WSJ text perform poorly on Brown corpus. Some studies have investigated domain adaptation for parsers (McClosky et al., 2006; Daumé III, 2007; McClosky et al., 2010). These approaches assume that the parsers know which domain it is used, and that it has access to representative data in that domain. However, in practice, these assumptions are unrealistic in many real applications, such as when processing the heterogeneous genre of web texts. In this paper we incorporate the web-derived selectional preference features to design our parsers for robust open-domain testing.","We conduct the experiments on the English Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993). The results show that web-derived selectional preference can improve the statistical dependency parsing, particularly for long dependency relationships. More importantly, when operating on new domains, the web-derived selectional preference features show great potential for achieving robust performance (Section 4.3).","The remainder of this paper is divided as follows. Section 2 gives a brief introduction of dependency parsing. Section 3 describes the web-derived selectional preference features. Experimental evaluation and results are reported in Section 4. Finally, we discuss related work and draw conclusion in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively."]},{"title":"2 Dependency Parsing","paragraphs":["In dependency parsing, we attempt to build head-modifier (or head-dependent) relations between words in a sentence.

In deciding the dependency between the main verb hit and its argument headed preposition with, an example of the N-gram PMI features and the conjoin features with the baseline are shown in Table 1. 3.2.2 PP-attachment","Propositional phrase (PP) attachment is one of the hardest problems in English dependency parsing. An English sentence consisting of a subject, a verb, and a nominal object followed by a prepositional phrase is often ambiguous. Ambiguity resolu-tion reflects the selectional preference between the verb and noun with their prepositional phrase. For example, considering the following two examples:","(1) John hit the ball with the bat.","(2) John hit the ball with the red stripe. In sentence (1), the preposition with depends on the main verb hit; but in sentence (2), the prepositional phrase is a noun attribute and the preposition with needs to depends on the word ball. To resolve this kind of ambiguity, there needs to measure the attachment preference. We thus have PP-attachment features that determine the PMI association across the preposition word “IN”7",": PMIIN (x, z) = log","p(“x IN z”) p(x) (5) 7 Here, the preposition word “IN” (e.g., “with”, “in”, . . .) is","any token whose part-of-speech is IN N-gram feature templates hw, mw, PMI(hw,mw) hw, ht, mw, PMI(hw,mw) hw, mw, mt, PMI(hw,mw) hw, ht, mw, mt, PMI(hw,mw)",". . .","hw, mw, sw","hw, mw, sw, PMI(hw, mw, sw)","hw, mw, gw","hw, mw, gw, PMI(hw, mw, gw) Table 2: Examples of N-gram feature templates. Each entry represents a class of indicator for tuples of information. For example, “hw, mw” reprsents a class of indicator features with one feature for each possible combination of head word and modifier word. Abbreviations: hw=head word, ht= head POS. st, gt=likewise for sibling and grandchild. PMIIN (y, z) = log","p(“y IN z”) p(y) (6) where the word x and y are usually verb and noun, z is a noun which directly depends on the preposition word “IN”. For example in sentence (1), we would include the features PMIwith(hit, bat) and PMIwith(ball, bat). If both PMI features exist and PMIwith(hit, bat) > PMIwith(ball, bat), indicating to our dependency parsing model that the preposition word with depends on the verb hit is a good choice. While in sentence (2), the features include PMIwith(hit, stripe) and PMIwith(ball, stripe). 3.3 N-gram feature templates We generate N-gram features by mimicking the template structure of the original baseline features. For example, the baseline feature set includes indicators for word-to-word and tag-to-tag interactions between the head and modifier of a dependency. In the N-gram feature set, we correspondingly introduce N-gram PMI for word-to-word interactions. 1559 The N-gram feature set for MSTParser is shown in Table 2. Following McDonald et al. (2005), all features are conjoined with the direction of attachment as well as the distance between the two words creating the dependency. In between N-gram features, we include the form of word trigrams and PMI of the trigrams. The surrounding word N-gram features represent the local context of the selectional preference. Besides, we also present the second-order feature templates, including the sibling and grandchild features. These features are designed to disambiguate cases like coordinating conjunctions and prepositional attachment. Consider the examples we have shown in section 3.2.2, for sentence (1), the dependency graph path feature ball → with → bat should have a lower weight since ball rarely is modified by bat, but is often seen through them (e.g., a higher weight should be associated with hit → with → bat). In contrast, for sentence (2), our N-gram features will tell us that the prepositional phrase is much more likely to attach to the noun since the dependency graph path feature ball → with → stripe should have a high weight due to the high strength of selectional preference between ball and stripe.","Web-derived selectional preference features based on PMI values are trickier to incorporate into the dependency parsing model because they are continuous rather than discrete. Since all the baseline features used in the literature (McDonald et al., 2005; Carreras, 2007) take on binary values of 0 or 1, there is a “mis-match” between the continuous and binary features. Log-linear dependency parsing model is sensitive to inappropriately scaled feature. To solve this problem, we transform the PMI values into a more amenable form by replacing the PMI values with their z-score. The z-score of a PMI value x is x−μ","σ , where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the PMI distribution, respectively."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted dependency parsing experiments in English.

The other two are smaller ones, accuracies increase linearly with the log of the number of types in the auxiliary data set. Similar observations have been made by Pitler et al. (2010).

For our proposed approach, the improvement relative to dependency length is shown in Figure 4. From the Figure, it is seen that our method gives observable better performance when dependency lengths are larger than 3. The results here show that the proposed approach improves the dependency parsing performance, particularly for long dependency relationships. 4.3 Cross-genre testing In this section, we present the experiments to validate the robustness the web-derived selectional preferences. The intent is to understand how well the web-derived selectional preferences transfer to other sources.","The English experiment evaluates the performance of our proposed approach when it is trained 1 10 20 300.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 1 Dependency Length F 1  S c o r e  ( % ) MST2 MST2+N-gram Figure 4: Dependency length vs. F1 score. on annotated data from one genre of text (WSJ) and is used to parse a test set from a different genre: the biomedical domain related to cancer (PennBioIE., 2005) with 2,600 parsed sentences.

However, this estimate is scale-invariant. Assume that when the number of pages indexed by Google grows, the number of pages containing a given search term goes to a fixed fraction. This means that if pages indexed by Google doubles, then so do the bigrams or trigrams frequencies. Therefore, the estimate becomes stable when the number of indexed pages grows unboundedly.

The idea of this paper is inspired by the work of Suzuki et al. (2009) and Pitler et al. (2010). The former uses the web-scale data explicitly to create more data for training the model; while the latter explores the web-scale N-grams data (Lin et al., 2010) for compound bracketing disambiguation. Our research, however, applies the web-scale data (Google hits and Google V1) to model the word-to-word dependency relationships rather than compound bracketing disambiguation.","Several previous studies have exploited the web-scale data for word pair acquisition. Keller and Lapata (2003) evaluated the utility of using web search engine statistics for unseen bigram. Nakov and Hearst (2005) demonstrated the effectiveness of using search engine statistics to improve the noun compound bracketing. Volk (2001) exploited the WWW as a corpus to resolve PP attachment ambiguities. Turney (2007) measured the semantic orientation for sentiment classification using co-occurrence statistics obtained from the search engines. Bergsma et al.

Our approach, however, extends these techniques to dependency parsing, particularly for long dependency relationships, which involves more challenging tasks than the previous work.","Besides, there are some work exploring the word-to-word co-occurrence derived from the web-scale data or a fixed size of corpus (Calvo and Gelbukh, 2004; Calvo and Gelbukh, 2006; Yates et al., 2006; Drabek and Zhou, 2000; van Noord, 2007) for PP attachment ambiguities or shallow parsing. Johnson and Riezler (2000) incorporated the lexical selectional preference features derived from British National Corpus (Graff, 2003) into a stochastic unification-based grammar. Abekawa and Okumura (2006) improved Japanese dependency parsing by using the co-occurrence information derived from the results of automatic dependency parsing of large-scale corpora. However, we explore the web-scale data for dependency parsing, the performance improves log-linearly with the number of parameters (unique N-grams).

More importantly, when operating on new domains, the web-derived selectional preferences show great potential for achieving robust performance."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 60875041 and No. 61070106), and CSIDM project (No. CSIDM-200805) partially funded by a grant from the National Research Foundation (NRF) administered by the Media Development Authority (MDA) of Singapore.
