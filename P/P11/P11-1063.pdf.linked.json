Bottom-up and top-down parsers typically require a completed string as input. This requirement makes it difficult to incorporate them into phrase-based translation, which generates partial hypothesized translations from left-to-right. Incremental syntactic language models score sentences in a similar left-to-right fashion, and are therefore a good mechanism for incorporating syntax into phrase-based translation. We give a formal definition of one such linear-time syntactic language model, detail its re-lation to phrase-based decoding, and integrate the model with the Moses phrase-based translation system. We present empirical results on a constrained Urdu-English translation task that demonstrate a significant BLEU score improvement and a large decrease in perplexity."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Early work in statistical machine translation viewed translation as a noisy channel process comprised of a translation model, which functioned to posit adequate translations of source language words, and a target language model, which guided the fluency of generated target language strings (Brown et al.,","This research was supported by NSF CAREER/PECASE award 0447685, NSF grant IIS-0713448, and the European Commission through the EuroMatrixPlus project.

Cleared for public release (Case Number 88ABW-2010-6489) on 10 Dec 2010. 1990). Drawing on earlier successes in speech recognition, research in statistical machine translation has effectively used n-gram word sequence models as language models.","Modern phrase-based translation using large scale n-gram language models generally performs well in terms of lexical choice, but still often produces ungrammatical output. Syntactic parsing may help produce more grammatical output by better modeling structural relationships and long-distance dependencies. Bottom-up and top-down parsers typically require a completed string as input; this requirement makes it difficult to incorporate these parsers into phrase-based translation, which generates hypothesized translations incrementally, from left-to-right.1 As a workaround, parsers can rerank the translated output of translation systems (Och et al., 2004).","On the other hand, incremental parsers (Roark, 2001; Henderson, 2004; Schuler et al., 2010; Huang and Sagae, 2010) process input in a straightforward left-to-right manner. We observe that incremental parsers, used as structured language models, provide an appropriate algorithmic match to incremental phrase-based decoding. We directly integrate incremental syntactic parsing into phrase-based translation. This approach re-exerts the role of the language model as a mechanism for encouraging syntactically fluent translations.","The contributions of this work are as follows:","• A novel method for integrating syntactic LMs into phrase-based translation (§3) • A formal definition of an incremental parser for 1 While not all languages are written left-to-right, we will","refer to incremental processing which proceeds from the begin-","ning of a sentence as left-to-right. 620 statistical MT that can run in linear-time (§4)","• Integration with Moses (§5) along with empirical results for perplexity and significant translation score improvement on a constrained Urdu-English task (§6)"]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Neither phrase-based (Koehn et al., 2003) nor hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2005) take explicit advantage of the syntactic structure of either source or target language. The translation models in these techniques definephrases as contiguous word sequences (with gaps allowed in the case of hierarchical phrases) which may or may not correspond to any linguistic constituent. Early work in statistical phrase-based translation considered whether restricting translation models to use only syntactically well-formed constituents might improve translation quality (Koehn et al., 2003) but found such restrictions failed to improve translation quality.","Significant research has examined the extent to which syntax can be usefully incorporated into statistical tree-based translation models: string-to-tree (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003; Imamura et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2004; Graehl and Knight, 2004; Melamed, 2004; Galley et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008), tree-to-string (Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007; Mi et al., 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008; Huang and Mi, 2010), tree-to-tree (Abeillé et al., 1990; Shieber and Schabes, 1990; Poutsma, 1998; Eisner, 2003; Shieber, 2004; Cowan et al., 2006; Nesson et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007; DeNeefe et al., 2007; DeNeefe and Knight, 2009; Liu et al., 2009; Chiang, 2010), and treelet (Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005) techniques use syntactic information to inform the translation model. Recent work has shown that parsing-based machine translation using syntax-augmented (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) hierarchical translation grammars with rich nonterminal sets can demonstrate substantial gains over hierarchical grammars for certain language pairs (Baker et al., 2009). In contrast to the above tree-based translation models, our approach maintains a standard (non-syntactic) phrase-based translation model. Instead, we incorporate syntax into the language model.","Traditional approaches to language models in speech recognition and statistical machine translation focus on the use of n-grams, which provide a simple finite-state model approximation of the target language. Chelba and Jelinek (1998) proposed that syntactic structure could be used as an alternative technique in language modeling. This insight has been explored in the context of speech recognition (Chelba and Jelinek, 2000; Collins et al., 2005). Hassan et al. (2007) and Birch et al. (2007) use supertag n-gram LMs. Syntactic language models have also been explored with tree-based translation models. Charniak et al. (2003) use syntactic language models to rescore the output of a tree-based translation system. Post and Gildea (2008) investigate the integration of parsers as syntactic language models during binary bracketing transduction translation (Wu, 1997); under these conditions, both syntactic phrase-structure and dependency parsing language models were found to improve oracle-best translations, but did not improve actual translation results. Post and Gildea (2009) use tree substitution grammar parsing for language modeling, but do not use this language model in a translation system. Our work, in contrast to the above approaches, explores the use of incremental syntactic language models in conjunction with phrase-based translation models.","Our syntactic language model fits into the family of linear-time dynamic programming parsers described in (Huang and Sagae, 2010). Like (Galley and Manning, 2009) our work implements an incremental syntactic language model; our approach differs by calculating syntactic LM scores over all available phrase-structure parses at each hypothesis instead of the 1-best dependency parse.","The syntax-driven reordering model of Ge (2010) uses syntax-driven features to influence word order within standard phrase-based translation. The syntactic cohesion features of Cherry (2008) encourages the use of syntactically well-formed translation phrases. These approaches are fully orthogonal to our proposed incremental syntactic language model, and could be applied in concert with our work."]},{"title":"3 Parser as Syntactic Language Model in Phrase-Based Translation","paragraphs":["Parsing is the task of selecting the representation τ̂ (typically a tree) that best models the structure of 621  ⟨s⟩ τ̃0  ⟨s⟩ the τ̃11  ⟨s⟩ that τ̃12  ⟨s⟩ president τ̃13 . . .  the president τ̃21  that president τ̃22  president Friday τ̃23 . . .  president meets τ̃31 ","Obama met τ̃32 . . .

After processing the tth token in string e, an incremental parser has some internal representation of possible hypothesized (incomplete) trees, τt.

An incremental syntactic language model can then be defined by a probability mass function (Equation 5) and a transition function δ (Equation 6). The role of δ is explained in §3.3 below. Any parser which implements these two functions can serve as a syntactic language model.

To prune the search space, lattice nodes are organized into beam stacks (Jelinek, 1969) according to the number of source words translated. An n-gram language model history is also maintained at each node in the translation lattice. The search space is further trimmed with hypothesis recombination, which collapses lattice nodes that share a common coverage vector and n-gram state. 3.3 Incorporating a Syntactic Language Model Phrase-based translation produces target language words in an incremental left-to-right fashion, generating words at the beginning of a translation first and words at the end of a translation last. Similarly, incremental parsers process sentences in an incremental fashion, analyzing words at the beginning of a sentence first and words at the end of a sentence last. As such, an incremental parser with transition function δ can be incorporated into the phrase-based decoding process in a straightforward manner. Each node in the translation lattice is augmented with a syntactic language model state τ̃t.","The hypothesis at the root of the translation lattice is initialized with τ̃ 0, representing the internal state of the incremental parser before any input words are processed. The phrase-based translation decoding process adds nodes to the lattice; each new node contains one or more target language words. Each node contains a backpointer to its parent node, in which τ̃ t−1 is stored. Given a new target language word et and τ̃ t−1, the incremental parser’s transition function δ calculates τ̃ t.

Figure 9 shows a statistically significant improvement to the BLEU score when using the HHMM and the n-gram LMs to-gether on this reduced test set."]},{"title":"7 Discussion","paragraphs":["This paper argues that incremental syntactic languages models are a straightforward and appro-Moses LM(s) BLEU n-gram only 18.78 HHMM + n-gram 19.78 Figure 9: Results for Ur-En devtest (only sentences with 1-20 words) with HHMM beam size of 2000 and Moses settings of distortion limit 10, stack size 200, and ttable limit 20. priate algorithmic fit for incorporating syntax into phrase-based statistical machine translation, since both process sentences in an incremental left-to-right fashion. This means incremental syntactic LM scores can be calculated during the decoding process, rather than waiting until a complete sentence is posited, which is typically necessary in top-down or bottom-up parsing.","We provided a rigorous formal definition of incremental syntactic languages models, and detailed what steps are necessary to incorporate such LMs into phrase-based decoding. We integrated an incremental syntactic language model into Moses. The translation quality significantly improved on a constrained task, and the perplexity improvements suggest that interpolating between n-gram and syntactic LMs may hold promise on larger data sets.","The use of very large n-gram language models is typically a key ingredient in the best-performing machine translation systems (Brants et al., 2007). Our n-gram model trained only on WSJ is admittedly small. Our future work seeks to incorporate large-scale n-gram language models in conjunction with incremental syntactic language models.","The added decoding time cost of our syntactic language model is very high. By increasing the beam size and distortion limit of the baseline system, future work may examine whether a baseline system with comparable runtimes can achieve comparable translation quality.","A more efficient implementation of the HHMM parser would speed decoding and make more extensive and conclusive translation experiments possible. Various additional improvements could include caching the HHMM LM calculations, and exploiting properties of the right-corner transform that limit the number of decisions between successive time steps. 628"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Anne Abeillé, Yves Schabes, and Aravind K.
