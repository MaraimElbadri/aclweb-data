We propose a Gibbs sampler for fully Bayesian inference in IBM Model 1, integrating over all possible parameter values in finding the alignment distribution. We show that Bayesian inference outperforms EM in all of the tested language pairs, domains and data set sizes, by up to 2.99 BLEU points. We also show that the proposed method effectively addresses the well-known rare word problem in EM-estimated models; and at the same time induces a much smaller dictionary of bilingual word-pairs."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Word alignment is a crucial early step in the training of most statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, in which the estimated alignments are used for constraining the set of candidates in phrase/grammar extraction (Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2007; Galley et al., 2006). State-of-the-art word alignment models, such as IBM Models (Brown et al., 1993), HMM (Vogel et al., 1996), and the jointly-trained symmetric HMM (Liang et al., 2006), contain a large number of parameters (e.g., word translation probabilities) that need to be estimated in addition to the desired hidden alignment variables.","The most common method of inference in such models is expectation-maximization (EM) (Dempster et al., 1977) or an approximation to EM when exact EM is intractable. However, being a maximization (e.g., maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori (MAP)) technique, EM is generally prone to local optima and overfitting. In essence, the alignment distribution obtained via EM takes into account only the most likely point in the parameter space, but does not consider contributions from other points.","Problems with the standard EM estimation of IBM Model 1 was pointed out by Moore (2004) and a number of heuristic changes to the estimation procedure, such as smoothing the parameter estimates, were shown to reduce the alignment error rate, but the effects on translation performance was not reported. Zhao and Xing (2006) note that the parameter estimation (for which they use variational EM) suffers from data sparsity and use symmetric Dirichlet priors, but they find the MAP solution.","Bayesian inference, the approach in this paper, have recently been applied to several unsupervised learning problems in NLP (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Johnson et al., 2007) as well as to other tasks in SMT such as synchronous grammar induction (Blunsom et al., 2009) and learning phrase alignments directly (DeNero et al., 2008).","Word alignment learning problem was addressed jointly with segmentation learning in Xu et al. (2008), Nguyen et al. (2010), and Chung and Gildea (2009). The former two works place nonparametric priors (also known as cache models) on the parameters and utilize Gibbs sampling. However, alignment inference in neither of these works is exactly Bayesian since the alignments are updated by running GIZA++ (Xu et al., 2008) or by local maximization (Nguyen et al., 2010). On the other hand, 182 Chung and Gildea (2009) apply a sparse Dirichlet prior on the multinomial parameters to prevent over-fitting. They use variational Bayes for inference, but they do not investigate the effect of Bayesian inference to word alignment in isolation. Recently, Zhao and Gildea (2010) proposed fertility extensions to IBM Model 1 and HMM, but they do not place any prior on the parameters and their inference method is actually stochastic EM (also known as Monte Carlo EM), a ML technique in which sampling is used to approximate the expected counts in the E-step. Even though they report substantial reductions in alignment error rate, the translation BLEU scores do not improve.","Our approach in this paper is fully Bayesian in which the alignment probabilities are inferred by integrating over all possible parameter values as-suming an intuitive, sparse prior. We develop a Gibbs sampler for alignments under IBM Model 1, which is relevant for the state-of-the-art SMT systems since: (1) Model 1 is used in bootstrapping the parameter settings for EM training of higherorder alignment models, and (2) many state-of-the-art SMT systems use Model 1 translation probabilities as features in their log-linear model. We evaluate the inferred alignments in terms of the end-to-end translation performance, where we show the results with a variety of input data to illustrate the general applicability of the proposed technique. To our knowledge, this is the first work to directly investigate the effects of Bayesian alignment inference on translation performance."]},{"title":"2 Bayesian Inference with IBM Model 1","paragraphs":["Given a sentence-aligned parallel corpus (E, F), let ei (fj) denote the i-th (j-th) source (target)1","word in e (f ), which in turn consists of I (J ) words and denotes the s-th sentence in E (F).2","Each source sentence is also hypothesized to have an additional imaginary “null” word e0.

In this work, we marginalize out T by: P (E, F, A; Θ) = ∫ T P (E, F, A, T; Θ) (6) and obtain a collapsed Gibbs sampler, which samples only the alignment variables.","Using P (E, F, A; Θ) obtained in (6), the Gibbs sampling formula for the individual alignments is derived as:4","P (aj = i|E, F, A¬j","; Θ) = N ¬j ei,fj + θei,fj","∑VF f=1 N ¬j ei,f +","∑VF f=1 θei,f (7) where the superscript ¬j denotes the exclusion of the current value of aj.","The algorithm is given in Table 1.
