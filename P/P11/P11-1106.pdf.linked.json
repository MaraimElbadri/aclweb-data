Under some circumstances, such an error-correction capability might induce comprehenders to adopt grammatical analyses that are inconsistent with the true input. Here we present a formal model of how such input-unfaithful garden paths may be adopted and the difficulty incurred by their subsequent disconfirmation, combining a rational noisy-channel model of syntactic comprehension under uncertain input with the surprisal theory of incremental processing difficulty. We also present a behavioral experiment confirming the key empirical predictions of the theory."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In most formal theories of human sentence comprehension, input recognition and syntactic analysis are taken to be distinct processes, with the only feedback from syntax to recognition being prospective prediction of likely upcoming input (Jurafsky, 1996; Narayanan and Jurafsky, 1998, 2002; Hale, 2001, 2006; Levy, 2008a). Yet a system making optimal use of all available information might be expected to perform fully joint inference on sentence identity and structure given perceptual input, using linguistic knowledge both prospectively and retrospectively in drawing inferences as to how raw input should be segmented and recognized as a sequence of linguistic tokens, and about the degree to which each input token should be trusted during grammatical analysis. Formal models of such joint inference over uncertain input have been proposed (Levy, 2008b), and corroborative empirical evidence exists that strong coherence of current input with a perceptual neighbor of previous input may induce confusion in comprehenders as to the identity of that previous input (Connine et al., 1991; Levy et al., 2009).","In this paper we explore a more dramatic prediction of such an uncertain-input theory: that, when faced with sufficiently biasing input, comprehenders might under some circumstances adopt a grammatical analysis inconsistent with the true raw input comprising a sentence they are presented with, but consistent with a slightly perturbed version of the input that has higher prior probability. If this is the case, then subsequent input strongly disconfirm-ing this “hallucinated” garden-path analysis might be expected to induce the same effects as seen in classic cases of garden-path disambiguation traditionally studied in the psycholinguistic literature. We explore this prediction by extending the rational uncertain-input model of Levy (2008b), integrat-ing it with SURPRISAL THEORY (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008a), which successfully accounts for and quantifies traditional garden-path disambiguation effects; and by testing predictions of the extended model in a self-paced reading study. Section 2 reviews surprisal theory and how it accounts for traditional garden-path effects. Section 3 provides background information on garden-path effects relevant to the current study, describes how we might hope to reveal comprehenders’ use of grammatical knowledge to revise beliefs about the identity of previous linguistic sur-1055 face input and adopt grammatical analyses inconsistent with true input through a controlled experiment, and informally outlines how such belief revisions might arise as a side effect in a general theory of rational comprehension under uncertain input. Section 4 defines and estimates parameters for a model instantiating the general theory, and describes the predictions of the model for the experiment described in Section 3 (along with the inference procedures required to determine those predictions). Section 5 reports the results of the experiment. Section 6 concludes."]},{"title":"2 Garden-path disambiguation under surprisal","paragraphs":["The SURPRISAL THEORY of incremental sentence-processing difficulty (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008a) posits that the cognitive effort required to process a given word wi of a sentence in its context is given by the simple information-theoretic measure of the log of the inverse of the word’s conditional probability (also called its “surprisal” or “Shannon information content”) in its intra-sentential context w1,...,i−1 and extra-sentential context Ctxt: Effort(wi) ∝ log","1 P (wi|w1...i−1, Ctxt) (In the rest of this paper, we consider isolated-sentence comprehension and ignore Ctxt.) The theory derives empirical support not only from controlled experiments manipulating grammatical context but also from broad-coverage studies of reading times for naturalistic text (Demberg and Keller, 2008; Boston et al., 2008; Frank, 2009; Roark et al., 2009), including demonstration that the shape of the relationship between word probability and reading time is indeed log-linear (Smith and Levy, 2008).","Surprisal has had considerable success in accounting for one of the best-known phenomena in psycholinguistics, the GARDEN-PATH SENTENCE (Frazier, 1979), in which a local ambiguity biases the comprehender’s incremental syntactic interpretation so strongly that upon encountering disambiguating input the correct interpretation can only be recovered with great effort, if at all. The most famous example is (1) below (Bever, 1970): (1) The horse raced past the barn fell. where the context before the final word is strongly biased toward an interpretation where raced is the main verb of the sentence (MV; Figure 1a), the intended interpretation, where raced begins a reduced relative clause (RR; Figure 1b) and fell is the main verb, is extremely difficult to recover. Letting Tj range over the possible incremental syntactic analyses of words w1...6 preceding fell, under surprisal the conditional probability of the disambiguating continuation fell can be approximated as P (fell|w1...6) = ∑ j P (fell|Tj, w1...6)P (Tj|w1...6) (I) For all possible predisambiguation analyses Tj, either the analysis is disfavored by the context (P (Tj|w1...6) is low) or the analysis makes the disambiguating word unlikely (P (fell|Tj, w1...6) is low). Since every summand in the marginalization of Equation (I) has a very small term in it, the total marginal probability is thus small and the surprisal is high. Hale (2001) demonstrated that surprisal thus predicts strong garden-pathing effects in the classic sentence The horse raced past the barn fell on basis of the overall rarity of reduced relative clauses alone. More generally, Jurafsky (1996) used a combination of syntactic probabilities (reduced RCs are rare) and argument-structure probabilities (raced is usually intransitive) to estimate the probability ratio of the two analyses of pre-disambiguation context in Figure 1 as roughly 82:1, putting a lower bound on the additional surprisal incurred at fell for the reduced-RC variant over the unreduced variant (The horse that was raced past the barn fell) of 6.4 bits.1"]},{"title":"3 Garden-pathing and input uncertainty","paragraphs":["We now move on to cases where garden-pathing can apparently be blocked by only small changes to the surface input, which we will take as a starting point for developing an integrated theory of uncertain-input inference and surprisal. The backdrop is what is known in the psycholinguistic literature as the NP/Z ambiguity, exemplified in (2) below:","1","We say that this is a “lower bound” because incorporat-ing even finer-grained information—such as the fact that horse is a canonical subject for intransitive raced—into the estimate would almost certainly push the probability ratio even farther in favor of the main-clause analysis. 1056 S NP DT The NN horse VP VBD raced PP IN past NP DT the NN barn ... (a) MV interpretation S NP DT The NN horse RRC S VP VBN raced PP IN past NP DT the NN barn VP ... (b) RR interpretation Figure 1: Classic garden pathing (2) While Mary was mending the socks fell off her lap. In incremental comprehension, the phrase the socks is ambiguous between being the NP object of the preceding subordinate-clause verb mending versus being the subject of the main clause (in which case mending has a Zero object); in sentences like (2) the initial bias is toward the NP interpretation. The main-clause verb fell disambiguates, rul-ing out the initially favored NP analysis. It has been known since Frazier and Rayner (1982) that this effect of garden-path disambiguation can be measured in reading times on the main-clause verb (see also Mitchell, 1987; Ferreira and Henderson, 1993; Adams et al., 1998; Sturt et al., 1999; Hill and Murray, 2000; Christianson et al., 2001; van Gompel and Pickering, 2001; Tabor and Hutchins, 2004; Staub, 2007). Small changes to the context can have huge effects on comprehenders’ initial in-terpretations, however. It is unusual for sentence-initial subordinate clauses not to end with a comma or some other type of punctuation (searches in the parsed Brown corpus put the rate at about 18%); empirically it has consistently been found that a comma eliminates the garden-path effect in NP/Z sentences: (3) While Mary was mending, the socks fell off her lap. Understanding sentences like (3) is intuitively much easier, and reading times at the disambiguating verb are reliably lower when compared with (2). Fodor (2002) summarized the power of this effect succinctly:","[w]ith a comma after mending, there would be no syntactic garden path left to be studied. (Fodor, 2002)","In a surprisal model with clean, veridical input, Fodor’s conclusion is exactly what is predicted: separating a verb from its direct object with a comma effectively never happens in edited, published written English, so the conditional probability of the NP analysis should be close to zero.2","When uncertainty about surface input is introduced, however— due to visual noise, imperfect memory representations, and/or beliefs about possible speaker error— analyses come into play in which some parts of the true string are treated as if they were absent. In particular, because the two sentences are perceptual neighbors, the pre-disambiguation garden-path analysis of (2) may be entertained in (3).","We can get a tighter handle on the effect of input uncertainty by extending Levy (2008b)’s analysis of the expected beliefs of a comprehender about the sequence of words constituting an input sentence to joint inference over both sentence identity and sentence structure.

At the same time, the uncertain-input theory predicts that if we manipulate the balance of prior grammatical probabilities PC (T, w) strongly enough (term (i) in Equation (II)), it may shift the comprehender’s beliefs toward a garden-path interpretation. This observation sets the stage for our experimental manipulation, illustrated below:","(4) As the soldiers marched, toward the tank lurched an injured enemy combatant. Example (4) is qualitatively similar to (3), but with two crucial differences. First, there has been LOCA-TIVE INVERSION (Bolinger, 1971; Bresnan, 1994) in the main clause: a locative PP has been fronted before the verb, and the subject NP is realized postverbally. Locative inversion is a low-frequency construction, hence it is crucially disfavored by the comprehender’s prior over possible grammatical structures. Second, the subordinate-clause verb is no longer transitive, as in (3); instead it is intransitive but could itself take the main-clause fronted PP as a dependent. Taken together, these properties should shift comprehenders’ posterior inferences given prior grammatical knowledge and pre-disambiguation input more sharply than in (3) toward the input-unfaithful interpretation in which the immediately preverbal main-clause constituent (toward the tank in (4)) is interpreted as a dependent of the subordinate-clause verb, as if the comma were absent.","If comprehenders do indeed seriously entertain such interpretations, then we should be able to find the empirical hallmarks (e.g., elevated reading times) of garden-path disambiguation at the main-clause verb lurched, which is incompatible with the “hallucinated” garden-path interpretation. Empirically, however, it is important to disentangle these empirical hallmarks of garden-path disambiguation from more general disruption that may be induced by encountering locative inversion itself. We address this issue by introducing a control condition in which a postverbal PP is placed within the subordinate clause:","(5) As the soldiers marched into the bunker, toward the tank lurched an injured enemy combatant. [+PP] Crucially, this PP fills a similar thematic role for the subordinate-clause verb marched as the main-clause fronted PP would, reducing the extent to which the comprehender’s prior favors the input-unfaithful interpretation (that is, the prior ratio","P (marched into the bunker toward the tank|VP)","P (marched into the bunker|VP) for (5) is much lower than the corresponding prior ratio P (marched toward the tank|VP)","P (marched|VP) for (4)), while leaving locative inversion present. Finally, to ensure that sentence length itself does not create a confound driving any observed processing-time difference, we cross presence/absence of the subordinate-clause PP with inversion in the main clause: (6)","a. As the soldiers marched, the tank lurched toward an injured enemy combatant. [Uninverted,−PP]","b. As the soldiers marched into the bunker, the tank lurched toward an injured enemy combatant.

However, the PPs involved are overwhelmingly (i) set expressions, such as for example, in essence, and of course, or (ii) manner or temporal adjuncts. The handful of true locative PPs (5 in total) are all parentheticals intervening between the verb and a complement strongly selected by the verb (e.g., [VP means, in my country, homosexual]); none fulfill one of the verb’s thematic requirements. certain input is represented as a weighted finite-state automaton (WFSA), allowing us to represent the incremental inferences of the comprehender through intersection of the input WFSA with the PCFG above (Bar-Hillel et al., 1964; Nederhof and Satta, 2003, 2008). 4.1 Uncertain-input representations Levy (2008a) introduced the LEVENSHTEIN-DISTANCE KERNEL as a model of the average effect of noise in uncertain-input probabilistic sentence comprehension; this corresponds to term (ii) in our Equation (II). This kernel had a single noise parameter governing scaling of the cost of considering word substitutions, insertions, and deletions are considered, with the cost of a word substitution falling off exponentially with Levenshtein distance between the true word and the substituted word, and the cost of word insertion or deletion falling off exponentially with word length. The distribution over the infinite set of strings w can be encoded in a weighted finite-state automaton, facilitating efficient inference.","We use the Levenshtein-distance kernel here to capture the effects of perceptual noise, but make two modifications necessary for incremental inference and for the correct computation of surprisal values for new input: the distribution over already-seen input must be proper, and possible future inputs must be costless.

In order to ensure that the distribution over already-seen input is proper, we normalize the costs on outgoing arcs from all states but j.6","Figure 2 gives an example of a simple WFSA representation for a short partial input with a small lexicon. 4.2 Inference Computing the surprisal incurred by the disambiguating element given an uncertain-input representation of the sentence involves a standard application of the definition of conditional probability (Hale, 2001): log","1 P (I1...i|I1...i−1) = log P (I1...i−1) P (I1...i) (III) Since our uncertain inputs I1...k are encoded by a WFSA, the probability P (I1...k) is equal to the partition function of the intersection of this WFSA with the PCFG given in Table 1.7","PCFGs are a special class of weighted context-free grammars (WCFGs),","6","If a state’s total unnormalized cost of insertion arcs is α and that of deletion and insertion arcs is β, its normalizing constant is β","1−α . Note that we must have α < 1, placing a constraint on the value that γ can take (above which the normalizing constant diverges).","7","Using the WFSA representation of average noise effects here actually involves one simplifying assumption, that the av-which are closed under intersection with WFSAs; a constructive procedure exists for finding the intersection (Bar-Hillel et al., 1964; Nederhof and Satta, 2003). Hence we are left with finding the partition function of a WCFG, which cannot be computed exactly, but a number of approximation methods are known (Stolcke, 1995; Smith and Johnson, 2007; Nederhof and Satta, 2008). In practice, the computation required to compute the partition function under any of these methods increases with the size of the WCFG resulting from the intersection, which for a binarized PCFG with R rules and an n-state WFSA is Rn2",". To increase efficiency we implemented what is to our knowledge a novel method for finding the minimal grammar including all rules that will have non-zero probability in the intersection. We first parse the WFSA bottom-up with the item-based method of Goodman (1999) in the Boolean semiring, storing partial results in a chart. After completion of this bottom-up parse, every rule that will have non-zero probability in the intersection PCFG will be identifiable with a set of entries in the chart, but not all entries in this chart will have non-zero probability, since some are not connected to the root. Hence we perform a second, top-down Boolean-semiring parsing pass on the bottom-up chart, throwing out entries that cannot be derived from the root. We can then include in the intersection grammar only those rules from the classic construction that can be identified with a set of surviv-ing entries in the final parse chart.8","The partition functions for each category in this intersection grammar can then be computed; we used a fixed-point method preceded by a topological sort on the grammar’s ruleset, as described by Nederhof and Satta (2008).

This simplifying assumption has the advantage of bypassing commitment to a specific representation of perceptual input and should be justifiable for reasonable noise functions, but the issue is worth further scrutiny.","8","Note that a standard top-down algorithm such as Earley parsing cannot be used to avoid the need for both bottom-up and top-down passes, since the presence of loops in the WFSA breaks the ability to operate strictly left-to-right. 1060 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 8.5 9.0 9.5 10.0 10.5 11.0 Noise level g (high=noisy) Sur pr isal at main−clause v erb Inverted, +PP Uninverted, +PP Inverted, −PP Uninverted, −PP Figure 3: Model predictions for (4)–(6) pute the partition functions for noisy inputs I1...i−1 and I1...i corresponding to words w1...i−1 and words w1...i respectively, and take the log of their ratio as in Equation (III). 4.3 Predictions The noise level γ is a free parameter in this model, so we plot model predictions—the expected surprisal of input from the main-clause verb for each variant of the target sentence in (4)–(6)—over a wide range of its possible values (Figure 3). The far left of the graph asymptotes toward the predictions of clean surprisal, or noise-free input. With little to no input uncertainty, the presence of the comma rules out the garden-path analysis of the fronted PP toward the tank, and the surprisal at the main-clause verb is the same across condition (here reflecting only the uncertainty of verb identity for this small grammar). As input uncertainty increases, however, surprisal in the [Inverted, −PP] condition increases, reflecting the stronger belief given preceding context in an input-unfaithful interpretation."]},{"title":"5 Empirical results","paragraphs":["To test these predictions we conducted a word-by-word self-paced reading study, in which participants read by pressing a button to reveal each successive word in a sentence; times between button presses are recorded and analyzed as an in-dex of incremental processing difficulty (Mitchell, 1984).

As can be seen, the model’s predictions are matched at the main-clause verb: reading times are highest in the [Inverted, −PP] condition, and there is an interaction between main-clause inversion and presence of a subordinate-clause PP such that presence of the latter reduces reading times more for inverted than for uninverted main clauses. This interaction is significant in both by-participants and by-items ANOVAs (both p < 0.05) and in a linear mixed-effects analysis with participants- and item-specific random interactions (t > 2; see Baayen et al., 2008).

For this reason, and because the path from a speaker’s intended utterance to a comprehender’s perceived input is noisy and error-prone, a comprehension system making optimal use of available information would use current input not only for forward prediction but also to as-sess the veracity of previously encountered input. Here we have developed a theory of how such an adaptive error-correcting capacity is a consequence of noisy-channel inference, with a comprehender’s beliefs regarding sentence form and structure at any moment in incremental comprehension reflecting a balance between fidelity to perceptual input and a preference for structures with higher prior probability. As a consequence of this theory, certain types of sentence contexts will cause the drive toward higher prior-probability analyses to overcome the drive to maintain fidelity to input, undermin-ing the comprehender’s belief in an earlier part of the input actually perceived in favor of an analysis unfaithful to part of the true input. If subsequent input strongly disconfirms this incorrect interpretation, we should see behavioral signatures of classic garden-path disambiguation. Within the theory, the size of this “hallucinated” garden-path effect is indexed by the surprisal value under uncertain input, marginalizing over the actual sentence observed. Based on a model implementing theory we designed a controlled psycholinguistic experiment making specific predictions regarding the role of fine-grained grammatical context in modulating comprehenders’ strength of belief in a highly specific bit of linguistic input—a comma marking the end of a sentence-initial subordinate clause— and tested those predictions in a self-paced reading experiment. As predicted by the theory, reading times at the word disambiguating the “hallucinated” garden-path were inflated relative to control conditions. These results contribute to the theory of uncertain-input effects in online sentence processing by suggesting that comprehenders may be induced not only to entertain but to adopt relatively strong beliefs in grammatical analyses that require modification of the surface input itself. Our results also bring a new degree of nuance to surprisal theory, demonstrating that perceptual neighbors of true preceding input may need to be taken into account in order to estimate how surprising a comprehender will find subsequent input to be.","Beyond the domain of psycholinguistics, the methods employed here might also be usefully applied to practical problems such as parsing of degraded or fragmentary sentence input, allowing joint constraint derived from grammar and available input to fill in gaps (Lang, 1988). Of course, practical applications of this sort would raise challenges of their own, such as extending the grammar to broader coverage, which is delicate here since the surface input places a weaker check on overgeneration from the grammar than in traditional probabilistic parsing. Larger grammars also impose a technical burden since parsing uncertain input is in practice more computationally intensive than parsing clean input, raising the question of what approximate-inference algorithms might be well-suited to processing uncertain input with grammatical knowledge. Answers to this question might in turn be of interest for sentence processing, since the exhaustive-parsing idealization employed here is not psychologically plausible. It seems likely that human comprehension in-1062 volves approximate inference with severely limited memory that is nonetheless highly optimized to recover something close to the intended meaning of an utterance, even when the recovered meaning is not completely faithful to the input itself. Arriving at models that closely approximate this capacity would be of both theoretical and practical value."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["Parts of this work have benefited from presentation at the 2009 Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America and the 2009 CUNY Sentence Processing Conference.
