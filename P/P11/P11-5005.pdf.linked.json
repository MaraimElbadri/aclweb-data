The “acc” column is accuracy and the “errs” column is the absolute number of errors of the key type. Accuracy for the key “parent POS truth/guess → child POS” is computed as a function of the true relation. So, if the key is pt/pg → c, then accuracy is: acc = # of pt → c in Viterbi parses # of pt → c in gold parses . (25) In the following subsections we provide some analysis of the results from Table 4. 7.1 English Corrections Considering English first, there are several notable differences between EM and PR errors. Similar to the example for Spanish, the direction of the noun-determiner relation is corrected by PR. This is reflected by the VB/DT → NN key, the NN/VBZ → DT key, the NN/IN → DT key, the IN/DT → NN key, the NN/VBD → DT key, the NN/VBP → DT key, and the NN/VB → DT key, which for EM and SDP have accuracy 0. PR corrects these errors.","A second correction PR makes is reflected in the VB/TO → VB key. One explanation for the reason PR is able to correctly identify VBs as the parents of other VBs instead of mistakenly making TO the parent of VBs is that “VB CC VB” is a frequently occurring sequence. For example, “build and hold” and “panic and bail” are two instances of the “VB CC VB” pattern from the test corpus. Presented with such scenarios, where there is no TO present to be the parent of VB, PR chooses the first VB as the parent of the second. It maintains this preference for making the first VB a parent of the second when encountered with “VB TO VB” sequences, such as “used to eliminate”, because it would have to pay an additional penalty to make TO the parent of the second VB. In this manner, PR corrects the VB/TO → VB key error of EM and SDP. 26 Gold: DVM: DMV+Sparsity:"]},{"title":"Dependency Parsing Posterior Sparsity","paragraphs":["[Gillenwater et al. 11] 0 17.5 35 52.5 70 English Bulgarian Portuguese Checz Spanish German DMV DMV+Sparsity"]},{"title":"Dependency Parsing Linguistic Rules","paragraphs":["[Naseem et al. 10] Using Universal Linguistic Knowledge to Guide Grammar Induction Tahira Naseem, Harr Chen, Regina Barzilay","Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory","Massachusetts Institute of Technology {tahira, harr, regina} @csail.mit.edu","Mark Johnson Department of Computing Macquarie University","mark.johnson@mq.edu.au Abstract We present an approach to grammar induction that utilizes syntactic universals to improve dependency parsing across a range of languages. Our method uses a single set of manually-specified language-independent rules that identify syntactic dependencies between pairs of syntactic categories that commonly occur across languages. During inference of the probabilistic model, we use posterior expectation constraints to require that a minimum proportion of the dependencies we infer be instances of these rules. We also automatically refine the syntactic categories given in our coarsely tagged input. Across six languages our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a significant margin.1 1 Introduction Despite surface differences, human languages exhibit striking similarities in many fundamental as-pects of syntactic structure. These structural correspondences, referred to as syntactic universals, have been extensively studied in linguistics (Baker, 2001; Carnie, 2002; White, 2003; Newmeyer, 2005) and underlie many approaches in multilingual parsing. In fact, much recent work has demonstrated that learning cross-lingual correspondences from corpus data greatly reduces the ambiguity inherent in syntactic analysis (Kuhn, 2004; Burkett and Klein, 2008; Cohen and Smith, 2009a; Snyder et al., 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010).","1","The source code for the work presented in this paper is available at http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rbg/code/dependency/ Root → Auxiliary Noun → Adjective Root → Verb Noun → Article Verb → Noun Noun → Noun Verb → Pronoun Noun → Numeral Verb → Adverb Preposition → Noun Verb → Verb Adjective → Adverb Auxiliary → Verb Table 1: The manually-specified universal dependency rules used in our experiments. These rules specify headdependent relationships between coarse (i.e., unsplit) syntactic categories. An explanation of the ruleset is provided in Section 5.","In this paper, we present an alternative grammar induction approach that exploits these structural correspondences by declaratively encoding a small set of universal dependency rules. As input to the model, we assume a corpus annotated with coarse syntactic categories (i.e., high-level part-of-speech tags) and a set of universal rules defined over these categories, such as those in Table 1. These rules incorporate the definitional properties of syntactic categories in terms of their interdependencies and thus are universal across languages. They can potentially help disambiguate structural ambiguities that are difficult to learn from data alone — for example, our rules prefer analyses in which verbs are dependents of auxiliaries, even though analyz-ing auxiliaries as dependents of verbs is also consistent with the data. Leveraging these universal rules has the potential to improve parsing performance for a large number of human languages; this is particularly relevant to the processing of low-resource"]},{"title":"Small set of universal rules = 1 if edge in rule set Eq [φ(x, y)] ≥ b φ(x, y) Dependency Parsing Linguistic Rules","paragraphs":["[Naseem et al. 10] 0 20 40 60 80 English Danish Portuguese Slovene Spanish Swedish DMV DMV+Rules"]},{"title":"Dependency Parsing: Applications using Other Models • Tree CRF •","paragraphs":["[Druck et al. 09]"]},{"title":"• MST Parser •","paragraphs":["[Ganchev et al. 09]"]},{"title":"Other Applications • Multi view learn i ng: •","paragraphs":["[Ganchev et al. 08]"]},{"title":"• Relation extraction: •","paragraphs":["[Chen et al. 11]"]},{"title":"Implementation Tips and Tricks Off-the-Shelf Tools: MALLET http://mallet.cs.umass.edu •","paragraphs":["off-the-shelf support for labeled features"]},{"title":"•","paragraphs":["models: MaxEnt Classifier, Linear Chain CRF (one and two label constraints)"]},{"title":"•","paragraphs":["methods: GE and PR"]},{"title":"•","paragraphs":["constraints on label distributions for input features"]},{"title":"•","paragraphs":["GE penalties: KL divergence, (+ soft inequalities)"]},{"title":"•","paragraphs":["PR penalties: (+ soft inequalities)"]},{"title":"•","paragraphs":["in development: Tree CRF, and other penalties l 2 2 l 2 2 l1"]},{"title":"Off-the-Shelf Tools: MALLET http://mallet.cs.umass.edu •","paragraphs":["import data in SVMLight-like or CoNLL03-like formats"]},{"title":"•","paragraphs":["import constraints in a simple text format:"]},{"title":"•","paragraphs":["easily specify method options (i.e. SimpleTagger): positive interesting:2 film:1 ... negative tired:1 sequel:1 ... positive best:1 recommend:2 ...

[2007], and has been used also in Chang et al. [2008]. A further paper on the topic is in submission [Chang et al., 2010]. 2 Generalized Expectation Generalized Expectation (GE) constraints were first introduced by Mann and McCallum [2007]1","and were used to incorporate prior knowledge about the label distribution into semi-supervised classification. GE constraints have also been used to leverage “labeled features” in document classification [Druck et al., 2008] and information extraction [Mann and McCallum, 2008, Druck et al., 2009b, Bellare and McCallum, 2009], and to incorporate linguistic prior knowledge into dependency grammar induction [Druck et al., 2009a]. 3 Posterior Regularization The most clearly written overview of Posterior Regularization (PR) is Ganchev et al. [2010]. PR was first introduced in Graca et al. [2008], and has been applied to dependency grammar induction [Ganchev et al., 2009, Gillenwater et al., 2009, 2011, Naseem et al., 2010], part of speech induction [Graça et al., 2009a], multi-view learning [Ganchev et al., 2008], word alignment [Graca et al., 2008, Ganchev et al., 2009, Graça et al., 2009b], and cross-lingual semantic alignment [Platt et al., 2010]. The framework was independently discovered by Bellare et al. [2009] as an approximation to GE constraints, under the name Alternating Projections, and used under that name also by Singh et al. [2010] and Druck and McCallum [2010] for information extraction. The framework was also independently discovered by Liang et al. [2009] as an approximation to","1","In Mann and McCallum [2007] the method was called Expectation Regularization. a Bayesian model motivated by modeling prior information as measurements, and applied to information extraction. 4Closelyrelatedframeworks Quadrianto et al. [2009] introduce a distribution matching framework very closely related to GE constraints, with the idea that the model should predict the same feature expectations on labeled and undlabeled data for a set of features, formalized as a kernel.","Carlson et al. [2010] introduce a framework for semi-supervised learning based on constraints, and trained with an iterative update algorithm very similar to CoDL, but introducing only confident constraints as the algorithm progresses.","Gupta and Sarawagi [2011] introduce a framework for agreement that is closely related to the PR-based work in Ganchev et al. [2008], with a slightly different objective and a different training algorithm. References","K. Bellare, G. Druck, and A. McCallum. Alternating projections for learning with expectation constraints.
