Knowledge-based weak supervision, using structured data to heuristically label a training corpus, works towards this goal by enabling the automated learning of a potentially unbounded number of relation extractors. Recently, researchers have developed multi-instance learning algorithms to combat the noisy training data that can come from heuristic labeling, but their models assume relations are disjoint — for example they cannot extract the pair Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple). This paper presents a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines a sentence-level extraction model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating the individual facts. We apply our model to learn extractors for NY Times text using weak supervision from Freebase. Experiments show that the approach runs quickly and yields surprising gains in accuracy, at both the aggregate and sentence level."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Information-extraction (IE), the process of generating relational data from natural-language text, continues to gain attention. Many researchers dream of creating a large repository of high-quality extracted tuples, arguing that such a knowledge base could benefit many important tasks such as question an-swering and summarization. Most approaches to IE use supervised learning of relation-specific examples, which can achieve high precision and recall. Unfortunately, however, fully supervised methods are limited by the availability of training data and are unlikely to scale to the thousands of relations found on the Web.","A more promising approach, often called “weak” or “distant” supervision, creates its own training data by heuristically matching the contents of a database to corresponding text (Craven and Kumlien, 1999). For example, suppose that r(e1, e2) = Founded(Jobs, Apple) is a ground tuple in the database and s =“Steve Jobs founded Apple, Inc.” is a sentence containing synonyms for both e1 = Jobs and e2 = Apple, then s may be a natural language expression of the fact that r(e1, e2) holds and could be a useful training example.","While weak supervision works well when the tex-tual corpus is tightly aligned to the database contents (e.g., matching Wikipedia infoboxes to associated articles (Hoffmann et al., 2010)), Riedel et al. (2010) observe that the heuristic leads to noisy data and poor extraction performance when the method is applied more broadly (e.g., matching Freebase records to NY Times articles). To fix this problem they cast weak supervision as a form of multi-instance learning, assuming only that at least one of the sentences containing e1 and e2 are expressing r(e1, e2), and their method yields a substantial improvement in extraction performance.","However, Riedel et al.’s model (like that of previous systems (Mintz et al., 2009)) assumes that relations do not overlap — there cannot exist two facts r(e1, e2) and q(e1, e2) that are both true for any pair of entities, e1 and e2. Unfortunately, this assumption is often violated; 541 for example both Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple) are clearly true. In-deed, 18.3% of the weak supervision facts in Freebase that match sentences in the NY Times 2007 corpus have overlapping relations.","This paper presents MULTIR, a novel model of weak supervision that makes the following contributions:","• MULTIR introduces a probabilistic, graphical model of multi-instance learning which handles overlapping relations.","• MULTIR also produces accurate sentence-level predictions, decoding individual sentences as well as making corpus-level extractions.","• MULTIR is computationally tractable. Inference reduces to weighted set cover, for which it uses a greedy approximation with worst case running time O(|R| · |S|) where R is the set of possible relations and S is largest set of sentences for any entity pair. In practice, MULTIR runs very quickly.","• We present experiments showing that MULTIR outperforms a reimplementation of Riedel et al. (2010)’s approach on both aggregate (corpus as a whole) and sentential extractions. Additional experiments characterize aspects of MULTIR’s performance."]},{"title":"2 Weak Supervision from a Database","paragraphs":["Given a corpus of text, we seek to extract facts about entities, such as the company Apple or the city Boston. A ground fact (or relation instance), is an expression r(e) where r is a relation name, for example Founded or CEO-of, and e = e1, . . . , en is a list of entities.","An entity mention is a contiguous sequence of tex-tual tokens denoting an entity. In this paper we assume that there is an oracle which can identify all entity mentions in a corpus, but the oracle doesn’t normalize or disambiguate these mentions. We use ei ∈ E to denote both an entity and its name (i.e., the tokens in its mention).","A relation mention is a sequence of text (including one or more entity mentions) which states that some ground fact r(e) is true. For example, “Steve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft, spoke recently at CES.” contains three entity mentions as well as a relation mention for CEO-of(Steve Ballmer, Microsoft). In this paper we restrict our atten-tion to binary relations. Furthermore, we assume that both entity mentions appear as noun phrases in a single sentence.","The task of aggregate extraction takes two inputs, Σ, a set of sentences comprising the corpus, and an extraction model; as output it should produce a set of ground facts, I, such that each fact r(e) ∈ I is expressed somewhere in the corpus.","Sentential extraction takes the same input and likewise produces I, but in addition it also produces a function, Γ : I → P(Σ), which identifies, for each r(e) ∈ I, the set of sentences in Σ that contain a mention describing r(e). In general, the corpus-level extraction problem is easier, since it need only make aggregate predictions, perhaps using corpus-wide statistics. In contrast, sentence-level extraction must justify each extraction with every sentence which expresses the fact.","The knowledge-based weakly supervised learning problem takes as input (1) Σ, a training corpus, (2) E, a set of entities mentioned in that corpus, (3) R, a set of relation names, and (4), ∆, a set of ground facts of relations in R. As output the learner produces an extraction model."]},{"title":"3 Modeling Overlapping Relations","paragraphs":["We define an undirected graphical model that allows joint reasoning about aggregate (corpus-level) and sentence-level extraction decisions.

The model is undirected and includes repeated factors for making sentence level predictions as well as globals factors for aggregating these choices.","For each entity pair e = (e1, e2), define x to be a vector concatenating the individual sentences xi ∈ S(e1,e2), Y to be vector of binary Y r","random variables, one for each r ∈ R, and Z to be the vector of Zi variables, one for each sentence xi. Our conditional extraction model is defined as follows: p(Y = y, Z = z|x; θ) def = 1 Zx ∏ r","Φjoin (yr",", z) ∏ i","Φextract (z i, xi)","where the parameter vector θ is used, below, to de-","fine the factorΦextract",".

We will make use of the Mintz et al. (2009) sentence-level features in the expeiments, as described in Section 7. 3.3 Discussion This model was designed to provide a joint approach where extraction decisions are almost entirely driven by sentence-level reasoning. However, defining the Y r","random variables and tying them to the sentence-level variables, Zi, provides a direct method for modeling weak supervision. We can simply train the model so that the Y variables match the facts in the database, treating the Zi as hidden variables that can take any value, as long as they produce the correct aggregate predictions.","This approach is related to the multi-instance learning approach of Riedel et al. (2010), in that both models include sentence-level and aggregate random variables. However, their sentence level variables are binary and they only have a single aggregate variable that takes values r ∈ R ∪ {none}, thereby ruling out overlapping relations. Additionally, their aggregate decisions make use of Mintz-style aggregate features (Mintz et al., 2009), that collect evidence from multiple sentences, while we use 543 Inputs: (1) Σ, a set of sentences, (2) E, a set of entities mentioned in the sentences, (3) R, a set of relation names, and (4) ∆, a database of atomic facts of the form r(e1, e2) for r ∈ R and ei ∈ E.

Since we are using weak learning, the Y r variables in Y are not directly observed, but can be approximated from the database ∆. We use a procedure, relVector(e1, e2) to return a bit vector whose jth bit is one if rj(e1, e2) ∈ ∆. The vector does not have a bit for the special none relation; if there is no relation between the two entities, all bits are zero.","Finally, we can now define the training set to be pairs {(xi, yi)|i = 1 . . . n}, where i is an index corresponding to a particular entity pair (ej, ek), xi contains all of the sentences with mentions of this pair, and yi = relVector(ej, ek).","Given this form of supervision, we would like to find the setting forθ with the highest likelihood: O(θ) = ∏ i p(yi|xi; θ) = ∏ i ∑ z p(yi, z|xi; θ)","However, this objective would be difficult to optimize exactly, and algorithms for doing so would be unlikely to scale to data sets of the size we consider. Instead, we make two approximations, described below, leading to a Perceptron-style additive (Collins, 2002) parameter update scheme which has been modified to reason about hidden variables, similar in style to the approaches of (Liang et al., 2006; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007), but adapted for our specific model. This approximate algorithm is computationally efficient and, as we will see, works well in practice.","Our first modification is to do online learning instead of optimizing the full objective. Define the feature sums φ(x, z) =","∑","j φ(xj, zj) which range over the sentences, as indexed by j. Now, we can define an update based on the gradient of the local log likelihood for example i:","∂ log Oi(θ) ∂θj = Ep(z|xi,yi;θ)[φj(xi, z)]","−Ep(y,z|xi;θ)[φj(xi, z)] where the deterministic OR Φjoin","factors ensure that the first expectation assigns positive probability only to assignments that produce the labeled facts yi but that the second considers all valid sets of extractions.","Of course, these expectations themselves, especially the second one, would be difficult to compute exactly. Our second modification is to do a Viterbi approximation, by replacing the expectations with maximizations. Specifically, we compute the most likely sentence extractions for the label facts arg maxz p(z|xi, yi; θ) and the most likely extraction for the input, without regard to the labels, arg maxy,z p(y, z|xi; θ). We then compute the features for these assignments and do a simple additive update.

In particular, we note that the factors Φjoin","represent deterministic dependencies between Z and Y, which when satisfied do not affect the probability of the solution. It is thus sufficient to independently compute an assignment for each sentence-level extraction variable Zi, ignor-ing the deterministic dependencies. The optimal setting for the aggregate variables Y is then simply the assignment that is consistent with these extractions. The time complexity is O(|R| · |S|).","Predicting sentence level extractions given weak supervision facts, arg maxz p(z|x, y; θ), is more challenging.

(2010) for generating weak supervision data, computing features, and evaluating aggregate extraction. We also introduce new metrics for measuring sentential extraction performance, both relation-independent and relation-specific. 6.1 Data Generation We used the same data sets as Riedel et al. (2010) for weak supervision. The data was first tagged with the Stanford NER system (Finkel et al., 2005) and then entity mentions were found by collecting each continuous phrase where words were tagged identically (i.e., as a person, location, or organization). Finally, these phrases were matched to the names of Freebase entities.","Given the set of matches, defineΣ to be set of NY Times sentences with two matched phrases, E to be the set of Freebase entities which were mentioned in one or more sentences, ∆ to be the set of Freebase facts whose arguments, e1 and e2 were mentioned in a sentence in Σ, and R to be set of relations names used in the facts of ∆. These sets define the weak supervision data. 6.2 Features and Initialization We use the set of sentence-level features described by Riedel et al. (2010), which were originally de-545 veloped by Mintz et al. (2009). These include in-dicators for various lexical, part of speech, named entity, and dependency tree path properties of entity mentions in specific sentences, as computed with the Malt dependency parser (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004) and OpenNLP POS tagger1",". However, unlike the previous work, we did not make use of any features that explicitly aggregate these properties across multiple mention instances.","The MULTIR algorithm has a single parameter T , the number of training iterations, that must be specified manually. We used T = 50 iterations, which performed best in development experiments. 6.3 Evaluation Metrics Evaluation is challenging, since only a small percentage (approximately 3%) of sentences match facts in Freebase, and the number of matches is highly unbalanced across relations, as we will see in more detail later. We use the following metrics. Aggregate Extraction Let ∆e","be the set of extracted relations for any of the systems; we compute aggregate precision and recall by comparing ∆e","with ∆. This metric is easily computed but underestimates extraction accuracy because Freebase is incomplete and some true relations in ∆e","will be marked wrong. Sentential Extraction Let Se","be the sentences where some system extracted a relation and SF","be the sentences that match the arguments of a fact in ∆. We manually compute sentential extraction accuracy by sampling a set of 1000 sentences from Se","∪ SF","and manually labeling the correct extraction decision, either a relation r ∈ R or none. We then report precision and recall for each system on this set of sampled sentences. These results provide a good approximation to the true precision but can overestimate the actual recall, since we did not manually check the much larger set of sentences where no approach predicted extractions. 6.4 Precision / Recall Curves To compute precision / recall curves for the tasks, we ranked the MULTIR extractions as follows. For sentence-level evaluations, we ordered according to 1 http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/ Recall P r e c is io n 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.300.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 SOLOR Riedel et al., 2010 MULTIR Figure 4: Aggregate extraction precision / recall curves for Riedel et al.

For aggregate comparisons, we set the score for an extraction Y r","= true to be the max of the extraction factor scores for the sentences where r was extracted."]},{"title":"7 Experiments","paragraphs":["To evaluate our algorithm, we first compare it to an existing approach for using multi-instance learning with weak supervision (Riedel et al., 2010), using the same data and features. We report both aggregate extraction and sentential extraction results. We then investigate relation-specific performance of our system. Finally, we report running time comparisons. 7.1 Aggregate Extraction Figure 4 shows approximate precision / recall curves for three systems computed with aggregate metrics (Section 6.3) that test how closely the extractions match the facts in Freebase. The systems include the original results reported by Riedel et al. (2010) as well as our new model (MULTIR). We also compare with SOLOR, a reimplementation of their algorithm, which we built in Factorie (McCallum et al., 2009), and will use later to evaluate sentential extraction.","MULTIR achieves competitive or higher precision over all ranges of recall, with the exception of the very low recall range of approximately 0-1%. It also significantly extends the highest recall achieved, from 20% to 25%, with little loss in precision. To investigate the low precision in the 0-1% recall range, we manually checked the ten highest con-546 Recall P r e c is io n 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 SOLORMULTIR Figure 5: Sentential extraction precision / recall curves for MULTIR and SOLOR. fidence extractions produced by MULTIR that were marked wrong. We found that all ten were true facts that were simply missing from Freebase. A manual evaluation, as we perform next for sentential extraction, would remove this dip. 7.2 Sentential Extraction Although their model includes variables to model sentential extraction, Riedel et al. (2010) did not report sentence level performance. To generate the precision / recall curve we used the joint model assignment score for each of the sentences that contributed to the aggregate extraction decision.","Figure 4 shows approximate precision / recall curves for MULTIR and SOLOR computed against manually generated sentence labels, as defined in Section 6.3. MULTIR achieves significantly higher recall with a consistently high level of precision. At the highest recall point, MULTIR reaches 72.4% precision and 51.9% recall, for an F1 score of 60.5%. 7.3 Relation-Specific Performance Since the data contains an unbalanced number of in-stances of each relation, we also report precision and recall for each of the ten most frequent relations. Let SM r be the sentences where MULTIR extracted an instance of relation r ∈ R, and let SF","r be the sentences that match the arguments of a fact about relation r in ∆. For each r, we sample 100 sentences from both SM","r and SF","r and manually check accuracy. To estimate precision P̃r we compute the ratio of true relation mentions in SM","r , and to estimate recall R̃r we take the ratio of true relation mentions in SF r which are returned by our system.","Table 1 presents this approximate precision and recall for MULTIR on each of the relations, along with statistics we computed to measure the quality of the weak supervision. Precision is high for the majority of relations but recall is consistently lower. We also see that the Freebase matches are highly skewed in quantity and can be low quality for some relations, with very few of them actually corresponding to true extractions. The approach generally performs best on the relations with a sufficiently large number of true matches, in many cases even achieving precision that outperforms the accuracy of the heuristic matches, at reasonable recall levels. 7.4 Overlapping Relations Table 1 also highlights some of the effects of learning with overlapping relations. For example, in the data, almost all of the matches for the administrative divisions relation overlap with the contains relation, because they both model relationships for a pair of locations. Since, in general, sentences are much more likely to describe a contains relation, this overlap leads to a situation were almost none of the administrate division matches are true ones, and we cannot accurately learn an extractor. However, we can still learn to accurately extract the contains relation, despite the distracting matches. Similarly, the place of birth and place of death relations tend to overlap, since it is often the case that people are born and die in the same city. In both cases, the precision outperforms the labeling accuracy and the recall is relatively high.","To measure the impact of modeling overlapping relations, we also evaluated a simple, restricted baseline. Instead of labeling each entity pair with the set of all true Freebase facts, we created a dataset where each true relation was used to create a different training example. Training MULTIR on this data simulates effects of conflicting supervision that can come from not modeling overlaps. On average across relations, precision increases 12 points but recall drops 26 points, for an overall reduction in F1 score from 60.5% to 40.3%. 7.5 Running Time One final advantage of our model is the modest running time.

Riedel et al. (2010) approach required approximately 6 hours to train on NY Times 05-06 and 4 hours to test on the NY Times 07, each without preprocessing. Although they do sampling for inference, the global aggregation variables require reasoning about an exponentially large (in the number of sentences) sample space.","In contrast, our approach required approximately one minute to train and less than one second to test, on the same data. This advantage comes from the decomposition that is possible with the deterministic OR aggregation variables. For test, we simply consider each sentence in isolation and during training our approximation to the weighted assignment problem is linear in the number of sentences. 7.6 Discussion The sentential extraction results demonstrates the advantages of learning a model that is primarily driven by sentence-level features. Although previous approaches have used more sophisticated features for aggregating the evidence from individual sentences, we demonstrate that aggregating strong sentence-level evidence with a simple deterministic OR that models overlapping relations is more effective, and also enables training of a sentence extractor that runs with no aggregate information.","While the Riedel et al. approach does include a model of which sentences express relations, it makes significant use of aggregate features that are primarily designed to do entity-level relation predictions and has a less detailed model of extractions at the individual sentence level. Perhaps surprisingly, our model is able to do better at both the sentential and aggregate levels."]},{"title":"8 Related Work","paragraphs":["Supervised-learning approaches to IE were introduced in (Soderland et al., 1995) and are too numerous to summarize here. While they offer high precision and recall, these methods are unlikely to scale to the thousands of relations found in text on the Web. Open IE systems, which perform self-supervised learning of relation-independent extractors (e.g., Preemptive IE (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006), TEXTRUNNER (Banko et al., 2007; Banko and Etzioni, 2008) and WOE (Wu and Weld, 2010)) can scale to millions of documents, but don’t output canonicalized relations. 8.1 Weak Supervision Weak supervision (also known as distant- or self supervision) refers to a broad class of methods, but we focus on the increasingly-popular idea of using a store of structured data to heuristicaly label a tex-tual corpus. Craven and Kumlien (1999) introduced the idea by matching the Yeast Protein Database (YPD) to the abstracts of papers in PubMed and training a naive-Bayes extractor. Bellare and Mc-Callum (2007) used a database of BibTex records to train a CRF extractor on 12 bibliographic relations. The KYLIN system aplied weak supervision to learn relations from Wikipedia, treating infoboxes as the associated database (Wu and Weld, 2007); Wu et al. (2008) extended the system to use smooth-ing over an automatically generated infobox taxon-548 omy. Mintz et al. (2009) used Freebase facts to train 100 relational extractors on Wikipedia. Hoffmann et al. (2010) describe a system similar to KYLIN, but which dynamically generates lexicons in order to handle sparse data, learning over 5000 Infobox relations with an average F1 score of 61%. Yao et al. (2010) perform weak supervision, while using selectional preference constraints to a jointly reason about entity types.","The NELL system (Carlson et al., 2010) can also be viewed as performing weak supervision. Its initial knowledge consists of a selectional preference constraint and 20 ground fact seeds. NELL then matches entity pairs from the seeds to a Web corpus, but instead of learning a probabilistic model, it bootstraps a set of extraction patterns using semi-supervised methods for multitask learning. 8.2 Multi-Instance Learning Multi-instance learning was introduced in order to combat the problem of ambiguously-labeled training data when predicting the activity of different drugs (Dietterich et al., 1997). Bunescu and Mooney (2007) connect weak supervision with multi-instance learning and extend their relational extraction kernel to this context.","Riedel et al. (2010), combine weak supervision and multi-instance learning in a more sophisticated manner, training a graphical model, which assumes only that at least one of the matches between the arguments of a Freebase fact and sentences in the corpus is a true relational mention. Our model may be seen as an extension of theirs, since both models include sentence-level and aggregate random variables. However, Riedel et al. have only a single aggregate variable that takes values r ∈ R ∪ {none}, thereby ruling out overlapping relations. We have discussed the comparison in more detail throughout the paper, including in the model formulation sec-tion and experiments."]},{"title":"9 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We argue that weak supervision is promising method for scaling information extraction to the level where it can handle the myriad, different relations on the Web. By using the contents of a database to heuristically label a training corpus, we may be able to automatically learn a nearly unbounded number of relational extractors. Since the processs of matching database tuples to sentences is inherently heuristic, researchers have proposed multi-instance learning algorithms as a means for coping with the result-ing noisy data. Unfortunately, previous approaches assume that all relations are disjoint — for example they cannot extract the pair Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple), because two relations are not allowed to have the same arguments.","This paper presents a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines a sentence-level extraction model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating the individual facts. We apply our model to learn extractors for NY Times text using weak supervision from Freebase. Experiments show improvements for both sentential and aggregate (corpus level) extraction, and demonstrate that the approach is computationally efficient.","Our early progress suggests many interesting directions. By joining two or more Freebase tables, we can generate many more matches and learn more relations. We also wish to refine our model in order to improve precision. For example, we would like to add type reasoning about entities and selectional preference constraints for relations. Finally, we are also interested in applying the overall learning approaches to other tasks that could be modeled with weak supervision, such as coreference and named entity classification.","The source code of our system, its output, and all data annotations are available at http://cs.uw.edu/homes/raphaelh/mr."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank Sebastian Riedel and Limin Yao for shar-ing their data and providing valuable advice.
