Two parallel lines of research have shown consistent improvements over the max–derivation decoding objective, which selects the highest probability derivation. Consensus decoding procedures select translations for a single system with a minimum Bayes risk (MBR) (Kumar and Byrne, 2004). System combination procedures, on the other hand, generate translations from the output of multiple component systems by combining the best fragments of these outputs (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994). In this paper, we present minimum Bayes risk system combination, a technique that unifies these two approaches by learning a consensus translation over multiple underlying component systems.","MBR system combination operates directly on the outputs of the component models. We perform an MBR decoding using a linear combination of the component models’ probability distributions. Instead of re-ranking the translations provided by the component systems, we search for the hypothesis with the minimum expected translation error among all the possible finite-length strings in the target language. By using a loss function based on BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), we avoid the hypothesis alignment problem that is central to standard system combination approaches (Rosti et al., 2007). MBR system combination assumes only that each translation model can produce expectations of n-gram counts; the latent derivation structures of the component systems can differ arbitrary. This flexibility allows us to combine a great variety of SMT systems.","The key contributions of this paper are three: the usage of a linear combination of distributions within the MBR decoding, which allows multiple SMT models to be involved in, and makes the computation of n-grams statistics to be more accurate; the decoding in an extended search space, which allows to find better hypotheses than the evidences provided by the component models; and the use of an expected BLEU score instead of the sentence-wise BLEU, which allows to efficiently apply MBR decoding in the huge search space under consideration.","We evaluate in a multi-source translation task obtaining improvements of up to +2.0 BLEU abs. over the best single system max-derivation, and state-of-the-art performance in the system combination task of the ACL 2010 workshop on SMT. 1268"]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["MBR system combination is a multi-system generalization of MBR decoding where the space of hypotheses is not constrained to the space of evidences. We expand the space of hypotheses following some underlying ideas of system combination techniques. 2.1 Minimum Bayes risk In SMT, MBR decoding allows to minimize the loss of the output for a single translation system. MBR is generally implemented by re-ranking an N - best list of translations produced by a first pass decoder (Kumar and Byrne, 2004). Different techniques to widen the search space have been described (Tromble et al., 2008; DeNero et al., 2009; Kumar et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009). These works extend the traditional MBR algorithms based on N - best lists to work with lattices.","The use of MBR to combine the outputs of various MT systems has also been explored previously. Duan et al. (2010) present an MBR decoding that makes use of a mixture of different SMT systems to improve translation accuracy. Our technique differs in that we use a linear combination instead of a mixture, which avoids the problem of component systems not sharing the same search space; perform the decoding in a search space larger than the outputs of the component models; and optimize an expected BLEU score instead of the linear approximation to it described in (Tromble et al., 2008).","DeNero et al. (2010) present model combination, a multi-system lattice MBR decoding on the conjoined evidences spaces of the component systems. Our technique differs in that we perform the search in an extended search space not restricted to the provided evidences, have fewer parameters to learn, and optimizes an expected BLEU score instead of the linear BLEU approximation.","Another MBR-related technique to combine the outputs of various MT systems was presented by González-Rubio and Casacuberta (2010). They use different median string (Fu, 1982) algorithms to combine various machine translation systems. Our approach differs in that we take into account the posterior distribution over translations instead of considering each translation equally likely, optimize the expected BLEU score instead of a sentence-wise measure such as the edit distance or the sentence-level BLEU, and take into account the quality differences by associating a tunable scaling factor to each system. 2.2 System Combination System combination techniques in MT take as input the outputs {e1, · · · , eN } of N translation systems, where en is a structured translation object (or N -best lists thereof), typically viewed as a sequence of words. The dominant approach in the field chooses a primary translationep as a backbone, then finds an alignmentan to the backbone for each en. A new search space is constructed from these backbone-aligned outputs and then a voting procedure of feature-based model predicts a final consensus translation (Rosti et al., 2007). MBR system combination entirely avoids this alignment problem by considering hypotheses as n-gram occurrence vectors rather than word sequences. MBR system combination performs the decoding in a larger search space and includes statistics from the components’ posteriors, whereas system combination techniques typically do not.","Despite these advantages, system combination may be more appropriate in some settings. In particular, MBR system combination is designed primarily for statistical systems that generate N -best or lattice outputs. MBR system combination can in-tegrate non-statistical systems that generate either a single or an unweighted output. However, we would not expect the same strong performance from MBR system combination in these constrained settings."]},{"title":"3 Minimum Bayes risk Decoding","paragraphs":["MBR decoding aims to find the candidate hypothesis that has the least expected loss under a probability model (Bickel and Doksum, 1977).

It uses the MBR decision rule on a linear combination of the probability distributions of the component systems. Unlike existing MBR decoding methods that re-rank translation outputs, MBR system combination search for the minimum risk hypotheses on the complete set of finite-length hypotheses over the output vocabulary. We assume the component systems to be statistically independent and define the Bayes gain as a linear combination of the Bayes gains of the components.

We used BLEU, choos-ing the scaling factors to maximize BLEU score of the set of translations predicted by MBR system combination. We perform the maximization by means of the down-hill simplex algorithm (Nelder and Mead, 1965). 4.2 Model Decoding In most MBR algorithms, the hypotheses space is equal to the evidences space.

MBR and MBR-SC were computed on 1000-best lists. MBR-SC uses expected BLEU as gain function using the conjoined evidences spaces of the three systems to compute expected BLEU statistics. It performs the search in the free monoid of the output vocabulary, and its model parameters were tuned using MERT on the development set. This is the standard setup for MBR system combination, and we refer to it as MBR-SC-E/C/Ex/MERT in Table 3.","MBR system combination improves single Best MAX system by +2.0 BLEU points in test, and always improves over MBR. This improvement could arise due to multiple reasons: the expected BLEU gain, the larger evidences space, the extended hypotheses space, or the MERT tuned scaling factor values. Table 3 teases apart these contributions.","We first apply MBR-SC to the best system (MBR-SC-Expected). Best MBR and MBR-SC-Expected differ only in the gain function: MBR uses sentence level BLEU while MBR-SC-Expected uses the expected BLEU gain described in Section 5. MBR-SC-Expected performance is comparable to MBR decoding on the 1000-best list from the single best system. The expected BLEU approximation performs as well as sentence-level BLEU and additionally requires less total computation.","We now extend the evidences space to the conjoined 1000-best lists (MBR-SC-E/Conjoin). MBR-SC-E/Conjoin is much better than the best MBR on a single system. This implies that either the expected BLEU statistics computed in the conjoined evidences space are stronger or the larger conjoined evidences spaces introduce better hypotheses.","When we restrict the BLEU statistics to be computed from only the best system’s evidences space (MBR-SC-E/C/evidences-best), BLEU scores dramatically decrease relative to MBR-SC-E/Conjoin. This implies that the expected BLEU statistics computed over the conjoined 1000-best lists are stronger than the corresponding statistics from the single best system. On the other hand, if we restrict the search space to only the 1000-best list of the best system (MBR-SC-E/C/hypotheses-best), BLEU scores also decrease relative to MBR-SC-E/Conjoin. This implies that the conjoined search space also contains better hypotheses than the single best system’s search space.","These results validate our approach. The linear combination of the probability distributions in the conjoined evidences spaces allows to compute much stronger statistics for the expected BLEU gain and also contains some better hypotheses than the single best system’s search space does.","We next expand the conjoined evidences spaces using the decoding algorithm described in Section 4.2 (MBR-SC-E/C/Extended). In this case, the expected BLEU statistics are computed from the conjoined 1000-best lists of the three systems, but the hypotheses space where we perform the decoding is expanded to the set of all possible finite-length hypotheses over the vocabulary of the evidences. We take the output of MBR-SC-E/Conjoin as the initial hypotheses of the decoding (see Algorithm 1). MBR-SC-E/C/Extended improves BLEU score of MBR-SC-E/Conjoin but obtains a slightly worse TER score. Since these two systems are identical in their expected BLEU statistics, the improvements in BLEU imply that the extended search space has introduced better hypotheses. The degradation in TER performance can be explained by the use of a BLEU-based gain function in the decoding process.","We finally compute the optimum values for the scaling factors of the different system using MERT (MBR-SC-E/C/Ex/MERT). MBR-SC-E/C/Ex/MERT slightly improves BLEU score of MBR-SC-E/C/Extended. This implies that the optimal values of the scaling factors do not deviate much from 1.0; a similar result was reported in (Och and Ney, 2001). We hypothesize that this is because the three component systems share the same SMT model, pre-process and decoding.

MBR-SC-C/Extended is also consistently better than MBR-SC-Conjoin with an almost constant improvement of +0.4 BLEU points. This result show that the extended search space always contains better hypotheses than the conjoined evidences spaces; also confirms the soundness of Algorithm 1 that allows to reach them.

Component systems can have varied decoding strategies; we only require that each system produce an N -best list (or a lattice) of translations. This flexibility allows the technique to be applied quite broadly. For instance, Leusch et al. (2010) generate intermediate translations in several pivot languages, translate them separately into the target language, and generate a consensus translation out of these using a system combination technique. Likewise, these pivot translations could be combined via MBR system combination.","MBR system combination has two significant advantages over current approaches to system combination. First, it does not rely on hypothesis alignment between outputs of individual systems. Align-ing translation hypotheses can be challenging and has a substantial effect on combination performance (He et al., 2008). Instead of aligning the sentences, we view the sentences as vectors of n-gram counts and compute the expected statistics of the BLEU score to compute the Bayes gain. Second, we do not need to pick a backbone system for combination. Choosing a backbone system can also be challenging and also affects system combination performance (He and Toutanova, 2009). MBR system combination sidesteps this issue by working directly on the conjoined evidences space produced by the outputs of the component systems, and allows the consensus model to express system preferences via scaling factors.","Despite its simplicity, MBR system combination provides strong performance by leveraging different consensus, decoding and training techniques. It out-performs best MAX or MBR derivation on each of the component systems. In addition, it obtains state-of-the-art performance in a constrained setting better suited for dominant system combination techniques."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["Work supported by the EC (FEDER/FSE) and the Spanish MEC/MICINN under the MIPRCV “Consolider Ingenio 2010” program (CSD2007-00018), the iTrans2 (TIN2009-14511) project, the UPV 1275 under grant 20091027 and the FPU scholarship AP2006-00691.
