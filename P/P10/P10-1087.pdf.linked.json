To allow cross-lingual navigation, Wikipedia offers cross-lingual interwiki links that for instance connect the Indonesian article about Albert Einstein to the corresponding articles in over 100 other languages. Such links are extraordinarily valuable for cross-lingual applications.","In the ideal case, a set of articles connected directly or indirectly via such links would all describe the same entity or concept. Due to conceptual drift, different granularities, as well as mistakes made by editors, we frequently find concepts as different as economics and manager in the same connected component. Filtering out inaccurate links enables us to exploit Wikipedia’s multilinguality in a much safer manner and allows us to create a multilingual register of named entities.","Contribution. Our research contributions are: 1) We identify criteria to detect inaccurate connections in Wikipedia’s cross-lingual link structure. 2) We formalize the task of removing such links as an optimization problem. 3) We introduce an algorithm that attempts to repair the cross-lingual graph in a minimally invasive way. This algorithm has an approximation guarantee with respect to optimal solutions. 4) We show how this algorithm can be used to combine all editions of Wikipedia into a single large-scale multilingual register of named entities and concepts."]},{"title":"2 Detecting Inaccurate Links","paragraphs":["In this paper, we model the union of cross-lingual links provided by all editions of Wikipedia as an undirected graph G = (V, E) with edge weights w(e) for e ∈ E. In our experiments, we simply honour each individual link equally by defining w(e) = 2 if there are reciprocal links between the two pages, 1 if there is a single link, and 0 other-wise. However, our framework is flexible enough to deal with more advanced weighting schemes, e.g. one could easily plug in cross-lingual measures of semantic relatedness between article texts.","It turns out that an astonishing number of connected components in this graph harbour inaccurate links between articles. For instance, the Esperanto article ‘Germana Imperiestro’ is about German emporers and another Esperanto article ‘Germana Imperiestra Regno’ is about the German Empire, but, as of June 2010, both are linked to the English and German articles about the German Empire. Over time, some inaccurate links may be fixed, but in this and in large numbers of other cases, the imprecise connection has persisted for many years. In order to detect such cases, we need to have some way of specifying that two articles are likely to be distinct. 844 Figure 1: Connected component with inaccurate links (simplified) 2.1 Distinctness Assertions Figure 1 shows a connected component that conflates the concept of television as a medium with the concept of TV sets as devices. Among other things, we would like to state that ‘Television’ and ‘T.V.’ are distinct from ‘Television set’ and ‘TV set’. In general, we may have several sets of entities Di,1, . . . , Di,li, for which we assume that any two entities u,v from different sets are pairwise distinct with some degree of confidence or weight. In our example, Di,1 = {‘Television’,‘T.V.’} would be one set, and Di,2 = {‘Television set’,‘TV set’} would be another set, which means that we are assuming ‘Television’, for example, to be distinct from both ‘Television set’ and ‘TV set’. Definition 1. (Distinctness Assertions) Given a set of nodes V , a distinctness assertion is a collection Di = (Di,1, . . . , Di,li) of pairwise disjoint (i.e. Di,j ∩ Di,k = ∅ for j ̸= k) subsets Di,j ⊂ V that expresses that any two nodes u ∈ Di,j, v ∈ Di,k from different subsets (j ̸= k) are asserted to be distinct from each other with some weight w(Di) ∈ R. We found that many components with inaccurate links can be identified automatically with the following distinctness assertions. Criterion 1. (Distinctness between articles from the same Wikipedia edition) For each language-specific edition of Wikipedia, a separate assertion (Di,1, Di,2, . . . ) can be made, where each Di,j contains an individual article together with its respective redirection pages. Two articles from the same Wikipedia very likely describe distinct concepts unless they are redirects of each other. For example, ‘Georgia (country)’ is distinct from ‘Georgia (U.S. State)’. Additionally, there are also redirects that are clearly marked by a category or template as involving topic drift, e.g. redirects from songs to albums or artists, from products to companies, etc. We keep such redirects in a Di,j distinct from the one of their redirect targets. Criterion 2. (Distinctness between categories from the same Wikipedia edition) For each language-specific edition of Wikipedia, a separate assertion (Di,1, Di,2, . . . ) is made, where each Di,j contains a category page together with any redirects. For instance, ‘Category:Writers’ is distinct from ‘Category:Writing’. Criterion 3. (Distinctness for links with anchor identifiers)The English ‘Division by zero’, for instance, links to the German ‘Null#Division’. The latter is only a part of a larger article about the number zero in general, so we can make a distinctness assertion to separate ‘Division by zero’ from ‘Null’. In general, for each interwiki link or redirection with an anchor identifier, we add an assertion (Di,1, Di,2) where Di,1,Di,2 represent the respective articles without anchor identifiers.","These three types of distinctness assertions are instantiated for all articles and categories of all Wikipedia editions. The assertion weights are tunable; the simplest choice is using a uniform weight for all assertions (note that these weights are different from the edge weights in the graph). We will revisit this issue in our experiments. 2.2 Enforcing Consistency Given a graph G representing cross-lingual links between Wikipedia pages, as well as distinctness assertions D1, . . . , Dn with weights w(Di), we may find that nodes that are asserted to be distinct are in the same connected component. We can then try to apply repair operations to reconcile the graph’s link structure with the distinctness asssertions and obtain global consistency. There are two ways to modify the input, and for each we can also consider the corresponding weights as a sort of cost that quantifies how much we are changing the original input:","a) Edge cutting: We may remove an edge e ∈ E from the graph, paying cost w(e).","b) Distinctness assertion relaxation: We may remove a node v ∈ V from a distinctness assertion Di, paying cost w(Di). 845 Removing edges allows us to split connected components into multiple smaller components, thereby ensuring that two nodes asserted to be distinct are no longer connected directly or indirectly. In Figure 1, for instance, we could delete the edge from the Spanish ‘TV set’ article to the Japanese ‘television’ article. In constrast, removing nodes from distinctness assertions means that we decide to give up our claim of them being distinct, instead allowing them to share a connected component.","Our reliance on costs is based on the assumption that the link structure or topology of the graph provides the best indication of which cross-lingual links to remove. In Figure 1, we have distinctness assertions between nodes in two densely connected clusters that are tied together only by a single spurious link. In such cases, edge removals can easily yield separate connected components. When, however, the two nodes are strongly connected via many different paths with high weights, we may instead opt for removing one of the two nodes from the distinctness assertion.","The aim will be to balance the costs for removing edges from the graph with the costs for removing nodes from distinctness assertions to produce a consistent solution with a minimal total repair cost. We accommodate our knowledge about distinctness while staying as close as possible to what Wikipedia provides as input.","This can be formalized as the Weighted Distinctness-Based Graph Separation (WDGS) problem. Let G be an undirected graph with a set of vertices V and a set of edges E weighted by w : E → R. If we use a set C ⊆ V to specify which edges we want to cut from the original graph, and sets Ui to specify which nodes we want to remove from distinctness assertions, we can be-gin by definingWDGS solutions as follows. Definition 2. (WDGS Solution). Given a graph G = (V, E) and n distinctness assertions D1, . . . , Dn, a tuple (C, U1, . . . , Un) is a valid WDGS solution if and only if ∀i, j, k ̸= j, u ∈ Di,j \\ Ui, v ∈ Di,k \\ Ui: P(u, v, E \\ C) = ∅, i.e. the set of paths from u to v in the graph (V, E \\ C) is empty. Definition 3. (WDGS Cost). Let w : E → R be a weight function for edges e ∈ E, and w(Di) (i = 1 . . . n) be weights for the distinctness assertions. The (total) cost of a WDGS solution S = (C, U1, . . . , Un) is then defined as c(S) = c(C, U1, . . . , Un) = [ ∑ e∈C w(e) ] + [ n ∑ i=1 |Ui| w(Di) ] Definition 4. (WDGS). A WDGS problem instance P consists of a graph G = (V, E) with edge weights w(e) and n distinctness assertions D1, . . . , Dn with weights w(Di). The objective consists in finding a solution (C, U1, . . . , Un) with minimal cost c(C, U1, . . . , Un).","It turns out that finding optimal solutions efficiently is a hard problem (proofs in Appendix A). Theorem 1. WDGS is NP-hard and APX-hard. If the Unique Games Conjecture (Khot, 2002) holds, then it is NP-hard to approximate WDGS within any constant factor α > 0."]},{"title":"3 Approximation Algorithm","paragraphs":["Due to the hardness of WDGS, we devise a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with an approximation factor of 4 ln(nq + 1) where n is the number of distinctness assertions and q = max i,j |Di,j|. This means that for all problem instances P , we can guarantee c(S(P )) c(S∗","(P )) ≤ 4 ln(nq + 1), where S(P ) is the solution determined by our algorithm, and S∗","(P ) is an optimal solution. Note that this approximation guarantee is independent of how long each Di is, and that it merely represents an upper bound on the worst case scenario. In practice, the results tend to be much closer to the optimum, as will be shown in Section 4.","Our algorithm first solves a linear program (LP) relaxation of the original problem, which gives us hints as to which edges should most likely be cut and which nodes should most likely be removed from distinctness assertions. Note that this is a continuous LP, not an integer linear program (ILP); the latter would not be tractable due to the large number of variables and constraints of the problem. After solving the linear program, a new – extended – graph is constructed and the optimal LP solution is used to define a distance metric on it. The final solution is obtained by smartly selecting regions in this extended graph as the individual output components, employing a region 846 growing technique in the spirit of the seminal work by Leighton and Rao (1999). Edges that cross the boundaries of these regions are cut. Definition 5. Given a WDGS instance, we define a linear program of the following form:","minimize ∑ e∈E dew(e) + n∑ i=1 li ∑ j=1 ∑ v∈Di,j ui,vw(Di)","subject to pi,j,v = ui,v ∀i, j<li, v ∈ Di,j (1) pi,j,v + ui,v ≥ 1 ∀i, j<li, v ∈ S k>j Di,k (2) pi,j,v ≤ pi,j,u + de ∀i, j<li, e=(u,v) ∈ E (3) de ≥ 0 ∀e ∈ E (4) ui,v ≥ 0 ∀i, v ∈ l iS j=1 Di,j (5) pi,j,v ≥ 0 ∀i, j<li, v∈V (6) The LP uses decision variables de and ui,v, and auxiliary variables pi,j,v that we refer to as potential variables. The de variables indicate whether (in the continuous LP: to what degree) an edge e should be deleted, and the ui,v variables indicate whether (to what degree) v should be removed from a distinctness assertion Di. The LP objective function corresponds to Definition 3, aiming to minimize the total costs. A potential variable pi,j,v reflects a sort of potential difference between an assertion Di,j and a node v. If pi,j,v = 0, then v is still connected to nodes in Di,j. Constraints (1) and (2) enforce potential differences between Di,j and all nodes in Di,k with k > j. For instance, for distinctness between ‘New York City’ and ‘New York’ (the state), they might require ‘New York’ to have a potential of 1, while ‘New York City’ has a potential of 0. The potential variables are tied to the deletion variables de for edges in Constraint (3) as well as to the ui,v in Constraints (1) and (2). This means that the potential difference pi,j,v + ui,v ≥ 1 can only be obtained if edges are deleted on every path between ‘New York City’ and ‘New York’, or if at least one of these two nodes is removed from the distinctness assertion (by setting the corresponding ui,v to non-zero values). Constraints (4), (5), (6) ensure non-negativity.","Having solved the linear program, the next major step is to convert the optimal LP solution into the final – discrete – solution. We cannot rely on standard rounding methods to turn the optimal fractional values of the de and ui,v variables into a valid solution. Often, all solution variables have small values and rounding will merely produce an empty (C, U1, . . . , Un) = (∅, ∅, . . . , ∅). Instead, a more sophisticated technique is necessary. The optimal solution of the LP can be used to define an extended graph G′","with a distance metric d between nodes. The algorithm then operates on this graph, in each iteration selecting regions that become output components and removing them from the graph. A simple example is shown in Figure 2. The extended graph contains additional nodes and edges representing distinctness assertions. Cutting one of these additional edges corresponds to removing a node from a distinctness assertion.","Definition 6. Given G = (V, E) and distinct-","ness assertions D1, . . . , Dn with weights w(Di),","we define an undirected graph G′","= (V ′",", E′",")","where V ′","= V ∪ {v i,v | i = 1 . . . n, w(Di) > 0, v ∈ ⋃","j Di,j}, E′","= {e ∈ E | w(e) > 0} ∪ {(v, vi,v) | v ∈ Di,j, w(Di) > 0}. We accordingly extend the definition ofw(e) to additionally cover the new edges by definingw(e) = w(Di) for e = (v, vi,v). We also extend it for sets S of edges by definingw(S) = ∑","e∈S w(e). Finally, we define a","node distance metric d(u, v) =    0 u = v de (u, v) ∈ E ui,v u = vi,v ui,u v = vi,u min p∈","P(u,v,E′",") ∑","(u′ ,v′",") ∈p","d(u′ , v′",") otherwise,","where P(u, v, E′",") denotes the set of acyclic paths","between two nodes in E′",". We further fix ĉf = ∑ (u,v)∈E′ d(u, v) w(e) as the weight of the fractional solution of the LP (ĉf is a constant based on the original E′",", irrespective of later modifications to the graph). Definition 7. Around a given node v in G′",", we consider regions R(v, r) ⊆ V with radius r. The cut C(v, r) of a given region is defined as the set of edges in G′","with one endpoint within the region and one outside the region:","R(v, r) = {v′","∈ V ′","| d(v, v′",") ≤ r}","C(v, r) = {e ∈ E′ | |e ∩ R(v, r)| = 1} For sets of nodes S ⊆ V , we define R(S, r) =⋃ v∈S R(v, r) and C(S, r) = ⋃ v∈S C(v, r). 847 Figure 2: Extended graph with two added nodes v1,u, v1,v representing distinctness between ‘Televisión’ and ‘Televisor’, and a region around v1,u that would cut the link from the Japanese ‘Television’ to ‘Televisor’","Definition 8.

The definition ofĉ(S, r) contains an additional slack component that is required for the approximation guarantee proof.","Based on these definitions, Algorithm 3.1 uses the LP solution to construct the extended graph. It then repeatedly, as long as there is an unsatisfied assertion Di, chooses a set S of nodes containing one node from each relevant Di,j. Around the nodes in S it simultaneously grows |S| regions with the same radius, a technique previously suggested by Avidor and Langberg (2007). These regions are essentially output components that determine the solution. Repeatedly choosing the radius that minimizes","w(C(S,r))","ĉ(S,r) allows us to obtain the approximation guarantee, because the distances in this extended graph are based on the solution of the LP.

The algorithm yields a solution (C, U1, . . . , Un) with an approximation factor of 4 ln(nq + 1) with respect to the cost of the optimal WDGS solution (C∗",", U ∗","1 , . . . , U ∗","n), where n is the number of distinctness assertions and q = max i,j |Di,j|.

From these dumps we produced two datasets. Dataset A captures cross-lingual interwiki links between pages, in total 77.07 million undirected edges (146.76 million original links). Dataset B additionally includes 2.2 million redirect-based edges. Wikipedia deals with interwiki links to redirects transparently, however there are many redirects with titles that do not co-refer, e.g. redirects from members of a band to the band, or from aspects of a topic to the topic in general. We only included redirects in the following cases:","• the titles of redirect and redirect target match after Unicode NFKD normalization, diacritics removal, case conversion, and removal of punctuation characters","• the redirect uses certain templates or categories that indicate co-reference with the target (alternative names, abbreviations, etc.) We treated them like reciprocal interwiki links by assigning them a weight of 2. 4.2 Application of Algorithm The choice of distinctness assertion weights de-pends on how lenient we wish to be towards conceptual drift, allowing us to opt for more fine- or more coarse-grained distinctions.

It may happen, however, that the graph’s topology is misleading, and that in a specific case deleting many cross-lingual links to separate two entities is more appropriate than looking for a conservative way to separate them. This led us 849 to study the linguistic adequacy. Two annotators evaluated 200 randomly selected separated pairs from Dataset A consisting of an English and a German article, with an inter-annotator agreement (Cohen κ) of 0.656. Examples are given in Table 2. We obtained a precision of 87.97% ± 0.04% (Wilson score interval) against the consensus an-notation. Many of the errors are the result of articles having many inaccurate outgoing links, in which case they may be assigned to the wrong component. In other cases, we noted duplicate articles in Wikipedia.","Occasionally, we also observed differences in scope, where one article would actually describe two related concepts in a single page. Our algorithm will then either make a somewhat arbitrary assignment to the component of either the first or second concept, or the broader generalization of the two concepts becomes a separate, more general connected component. 4.4 Large Problem Instances When problem instances become too large, the linear programs can become too unwieldy for linear optimization software to cope with on current hardware. In such cases, the graphs tend to be very sparsely connected, consisting of many smaller, more densely connected subgraphs. We thus in-vestigated graph partitioning heuristics to decompose larger graphs into smaller parts that can more easily be handled with our algorithm. The METIS algorithms (Karypis and Kumar, 1998) can de-compose graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes almost instantly, but favour equally sized clusters over lower cut costs. We obtained partitionings with costs orders of magnitude lower using the heuristic by Dhillon et al. (2007). 4.5 Database of Named Entities The partitioning heuristics allowed us to process all entries in the complete set of Wikipedia dumps and produce a clean output set of connected components where each Wikipedia article or category belongs to a connected component consisting of pages about the same entity or concept. We can regard these connected components as equivalence classes. This means that we obtain a large-scale multilingual database of named entities and their translations. We are also able to more safely transfer information cross-lingually between editions. For example, when an article a has a category c in the French Wikipedia, we can suggest the corresponding Indonesian category for the corresponding Indonesian article.","Moreover, we believe that this database will help extend resources like DBPedia and YAGO that to date have exclusively used the English Wikipedia as their repository of entities and classes. With YAGO’s category heuristics, even entirely non-English connected components can be assigned a class in WordNet as long as at least one of the relevant categories has an English page. So, the French Wikipedia article on the Dutch schooner ‘JR Tolkien’, despite the lack of a corresponding English article, can be assigned to the WordNet synset for ‘ship’. Using YAGO’s plural heuristic to distinguish classes (Einstein is a physicist) from topic descriptors (Einstein belongs to the topic physics), we determined that over 4.8 million connected components can be linked to WordNet, greatly surpassing the 3.2 million articles covered by the English Wikipedia alone."]},{"title":"5 Related Work","paragraphs":["A number of projects have used Wikipedia as a database of named entities (Ponzetto and Strube, 2007; Silberer et al., 2008).

The linear program given by Definition 5 enforces that for any i,j,k ̸= j,u ∈ Di,j, v ∈ Di,k, and any path v0, . . . , vt with v0 = u, vt = v we obtain ui,u +","∑t−1","l=0 d(vl,vl+1) +ui,v ≥ 1. The integer linear program obtained by augmenting Definition 5 with integer constraints de, ui,v, pi,j,v ∈ {0, 1} (for all applicable e, i, j, v) produces optimal solutions (C, U1, . . . , Uk) for WDGS problems, obtained as C = ({e ∈ E | de = 1}, Ui = {v | ui,v = 1}. Proof. Without loss of generality, let us assume that j < k. The LP constraints give us pi,j,vt ≤ pi,j,vt−1 +d(vt−1,vt), . . . , pi,j,v1 ≤ pi,j,v0 +d(v0,v1), as well as pi,j,v0 = ui,u and pi,j,vt + ui,v ≥ 1. Hence 1 ≤ pi,j,vt +ui,v ≤ ui,u +","∑t−1 l=0 d(vl,vl+1) + ui,v.","With added integrality constraints, we obtain either u ∈ Ui, v ∈ Ui, or at least one edge along any path from u to v is cut, i.e. P(u, v, E \\ C) = ∅. 851 This proves that any ILP solution enduces a valid WDGS solution (Definition 2).","Clearly, the integer program’s objective function minimizes c(C, U1, . . . , Un) (Definition 3) if C = ({e ∈ E | de = 1}, Ui = {v | ui,v = 1}. To see that the solutions are optimal, it thus suffices to observe that any optimal WDGS solution (C∗",", U ∗","1 , . . . , U ∗","n) yields a feasible ILP solution de = IC∗(e), ui,v = IU∗","i (v). Proof (Theorem 2). ri < 1","2 holds for any radius ri chosen by the algorithm, so for any region R(v0, r) grown around a node v0, and any two nodes u, v within that region, the triangle in-equality gives us d(u, v) ≤ d(u, v0) + d(v0, v) < 1 2 + 1","2 = 1 (maximal distance condition). At the same time, by Lemma 4 and Definition 6 for any u ∈ Di,j, v ∈ Di,k (j ̸= k), we obtain d(vi,u, vi,v) = d(vi,u, u) + d(u, v) + d(v, vi,v) ≥ 1. With the maximal distance condition above, this means that vi,u and vi,v cannot be in the same region. Hence u, v cannot be in the same region, unless the edge from vi,u to u is cut (in which case u will be placed in Ui) or the edge from v to vi,v is cut (in which case v will be placed in Ui). Since each region is separated from other regions via C, we obtain that ∀i, j, k ̸= j, u, v: u ∈ Di,j \\ Ui, v ∈ Di,k \\ Ui implies P(u, v, E \\ C) = ∅, so a valid solution is obtained. Lemma 5 (essentially due to Garg et al. (1996)). For any i where ∃j, k > j, u ∈ Di,j, v ∈ Di,k : P(vi,u, vi,v, E′",") ̸= ∅ and w(D","i) > 0, there exists","an r such that w(C(S, r)) ≤ 2 ln(nq + 1) ĉ(S, r),","0 ≤ r < 1","2 for any set S consisting of vi,v nodes. Proof. Define w(S, r) =","∑","v∈S w(C(v, r)). We will prove that there exists an appropriate r with w(C(S, r)) ≤ w(S, r) ≤ 2 ln(nq +1) ĉ(S, r). Assume, for reductio ad absurdum, that ∀r ∈ [0, 1","2 ) : w(S, r) > 2 ln(nq + 1)ĉ(S, r). As we expand the radius r, we note that ĉ(S, r) d","dr = w(S, r) whereever ĉ is differentiable with respect to r. There are only a finite number of pointsr1,. . . ,rl−1 in (0, 1","2 ) where this is not the case (namely, when ∃u ∈ S, v ∈ V ′",": d(u, v) = ri). Also note that ĉ increases monotonically for increasing values of r, and that it is universally greater than zero (since there is a path between vi,u, vi,v). Set r0 = 0, rl = 1","2 and choose ε such that 0 < ε ≪ min{rj+1 − rj | j < l}. Our assumption then implies: l∑ j=1 ∫ rj−ε rj−1+ε w(S,r) ĉ(S,r) dr > [ l∑ j=1 rj − rj−1 − 2ε ] 2 ln(nq + 1) l∑ j=1 ln ĉ(S, rj − ε) − ln ĉ(S, rj−1 + ε) > (1 2 − 2lε)","2 ln(nq + 1)","ln ĉ(S, 1 2 − ε) − ln ĉ(S, 0) > (1 − 4lε) ln(nq + 1)","ĉ(S, 1 2 −ε) ĉ(S,0) > (nq + 1)1−4lε","ĉ(S, 1","2 − ε) > (nq + 1)1−4lε","ĉ(S, 0) For small ε, the right term can get arbitrarily close to (nq + 1)ĉ(S, 0) ≥ ĉf + ĉ(S, 0), which is strictly larger than ĉ(S, 1","2 − ε) no matter how small ε becomes, so the initial assumption is false. Proof (Theorem 3). Let Si, ri denote the set S and radius r chosen in particular iterations, and ci the corresponding costs incurred: ci = w(C(Si, r) ∩ E) + |Ui|w(Di) = w(C(Di, r)). Note that any ri chosen by the algorithm will in fact fulfil the criterion described by Lemma 5, because ri is chosen to minimize the ratio between the two terms, and the minimizing r ∈ [0, 1","2 ) must be among the r considered by the algorithm (w(C(Di, r)) only changes at one of those points, so the minimum is reached by approach-ing the points from the left). Hence, we obtain ci ≤ 2 ln(n + 1)ĉ(Si, ri). For our global solution, note that there is no overlap between the regions chosen within an iteration, since regions have a radius strictly smaller than 1","2 , while vi,u, vi,v for u ∈ Di,j, v ∈ Di,k, j ̸= k have a distance of at least 1. Nor is there any overlap between regions from different iterations, because in each iteration the selected regions are removed from G′",". Globally, we therefore obtain c(C, U1, . . . , Un) =∑","i ci < 2 ln(nq + 1)","∑","i ĉ(Si, ri) ≤ 2 ln(nq + 1)2ĉf (observe that i ≤ nq). Since ĉf is the objective score for the fractional LP relaxation solution of the WDGS ILP (Lemma 4), we obtain ĉf ≤ c(C∗",", U ∗","1 , . . . , U ∗","n), and thus c(C, U1, . . . , Un) < 4 ln(n + 1)c(C∗",", U ∗","1 , . . . , U ∗","n). To obtain a solution in polynomial time, note that the LP size is polynomial with respect to nq and may be solved using a polynomial algorithm (Karmarkar, 1984). The subsequent steps run in O(nq) iterations, each growing up to |V | regions using O(|V |2",") uniform cost searches. 852"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Eytan Adar, Michael Skinner, and Daniel S.
