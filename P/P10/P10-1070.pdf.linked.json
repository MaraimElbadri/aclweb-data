The problem is difficult, with disagreement regarding the number and nature of the relations, low inter-annotator agreement, and limited annotated data. In this paper, we present a novel taxonomy of relations that integrates previous relations, the largest publicly-available annotated dataset, and a supervised classification method for automatic noun compound interpretation."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Noun compounds (e.g., ‘maple leaf’) occur very frequently in text, and their interpretation— determining the relationships between adjacent nouns as well as the hierarchical dependency structure of the NP in which they occur—is an important problem within a wide variety of natural language processing (NLP) applications, including machine translation (Baldwin and Tanaka, 2004) and question answering (Ahn et al., 2005). The interpretation of noun compounds is a difficult problem for various reasons (Spärck Jones, 1983). Among them is the fact that no set of relations proposed to date has been accepted as complete and appropriate for general-purpose text. Regardless, automatic noun compound interpretation is the focus of an upcoming SEMEVAL task (Butnariu et al., 2009).","Leaving aside the problem of determining the dependency structure among strings of three or more nouns—a problem we do not address in this paper—automatic noun compound interpretation requires a taxonomy of noun-noun relations, an automatic method for accurately assigning the relations to noun compounds, and, in the case of supervised classification, a sufficiently large dataset for training.","Earlier work has often suffered from using taxonomies with coarse-grained, highly ambiguous predicates, such as prepositions, as various labels (Lauer, 1995) and/or unimpressive inter-annotator agreement among human judges (Kim and Baldwin, 2005). In addition, the datasets annotated according to these various schemes have often been too small to provide wide coverage of the noun compounds likely to occur in general text.","In this paper, we present a large, fine-grained taxonomy of 43 noun compound relations, a dataset annotated according to this taxonomy, and a supervised, automatic classification method for determining the relation between the head and modifier words in a noun compound. We compare and map our relations to those in other taxonomies and report the promising results of an inter-annotator agreement study as well as an automatic classification experiment. We examine the various features used for classification and identify one very useful, novel family of features. Our dataset is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest noun compound dataset yet produced. We will make it available via http://www.isi.edu."]},{"title":"2 Related Work 2.1 Taxonomies","paragraphs":["The relations between the component nouns in noun compounds have been the subject of various linguistic studies performed throughout the years, including early work by Jespersen (1949). The taxonomies they created are varied. Lees created an early taxonomy based primarily upon grammar (Lees, 1960). Levi’s influential work postulated that complex nominals (Levi’s name for noun compounds that also permits certain adjectival modifiers) are all derived either via nominalization or 678 by deleting one of nine predicates (i.e., CAUSE, HAVE, MAKE, USE, BE, IN, FOR, FROM, ABOUT) from an underlying sentence construction (Levi, 1978). Of the taxonomies presented by purely linguistic studies, our categories are most similar to those proposed by Warren (1978), whose categories (e.g., MATERIAL+ARTEFACT, OBJ+PART) are generally less ambiguous than Levi’s.","In contrast to studies that claim the existence of a relatively small number of semantic relations, Downing (1977) presents a strong case for the existence of an unbounded number of relations. While we agree with Downing’s belief that the number of relations is unbounded, we contend that the vast majority of noun compounds fits within a relatively small set of categories.","The relations used in computational linguistics vary much along the same lines as those proposed earlier by linguists. Several lines of work (Finin, 1980; Butnariu and Veale, 2008; Nakov, 2008) as-sume the existence of an unbounded number of relations. Others use categories similar to Levi’s, such as Lauer’s (1995) set of prepositional para-phrases (i.e., OF, FOR, IN, ON, AT, FROM, WITH, ABOUT) to analyze noun compounds. Some work (e.g., Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998; Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003; Girju et al., 2005; Kim and Baldwin, 2005) use sets of categories that are somewhat more similar to those proposed by Warren (1978). While most of the noun compound research to date is not domain specific, Rosario and Hearst (2001) create and experiment with a taxonomy tailored to biomedical text. 2.2 Classification The approaches used for automatic classification are also varied. Vanderwende (1994) presents one of the first systems for automatic classification, which extracted information from online sources and used a series of rules to rank a set of most likely interpretations. Lauer (1995) uses corpus statistics to select a prepositional paraphrase. Several lines of work, including that of Barker and Szpakowicz (1998), use memory-based methods. Kim and Baldwin (2005) and Turney (2006) use nearest neighbor approaches based upon WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and Turney’s Latent Relational Analysis, respectively. Rosario and Hearst (2001) utilize neural networks to classify compounds according to their domain-specific relation taxonomy. Moldovan et al. (2004) use SVMs as well as a novel algorithm (i.e., semantic scattering). Nastase et al. (2006) experiment with a variety of classification methods including memory-based methods, SVMs, and decision trees. Ó Séaghdha and Copestake (2009) use SVMs and experiment with kernel methods on a dataset labeled using a relatively small taxonomy. Girju (2009) uses cross-linguistic information from parallel corpora to aid classification."]},{"title":"3 Taxonomy 3.1 Creation","paragraphs":["Given the heterogeneity of past work, we decided to start fresh and build a new taxonomy of relations using naturally occurring noun pairs, and then compare the result to earlier relation sets. We collected 17509 noun pairs and over a period of 10 months assigned one or more relations to each, gradually building and refining our taxonomy. More details regarding the dataset are provided in Section 4.","The relations we produced were then compared to those present in other taxonomies (e.g., Levi, 1978; Warren, 1978; Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998; Girju et al., 2005), and they were found to be fairly similar. We present a detailed comparison in Section 3.4.","We tested the relation set with an initial inter-annotator agreement study (our latest inter-annotator agreement study results are presented in Section 6). However, the mediocre results indicated that the categories and/or their definitions needed refinement. We then embarked on a series of changes, testing each generation by annotation using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service, a relatively quick and inexpensive online platform where requesters may publish tasks for anonymous online workers (Turkers) to perform. Mechanical Turk has been previously used in a variety of NLP research, including recent work on noun compounds by Nakov (2008) to collect short phrases for linking the nouns within noun compounds.","For the Mechanical Turk annotation tests, we created five sets of 100 noun compounds from noun compounds automatically extracted from a random subset of New York Times articles written between 1987 and 2007 (Sandhaus, 2008). Each of these sets was used in a separate annotation round. For each round, a set of 100 noun compounds was uploaded along with category defini-679 Category Name % Example Approximate Mappings Causal Group COMMUNICATOR OF COMMUNICATION 0.77 court order ⊃BGN:Agent, ⊃L:Acta+Producta, ⊃V:Subj PERFORMER OF ACT/ACTIVITY 2.07 police abuse ⊃BGN:Agent, ⊃L:Acta+Producta, ⊃V:Subj CREATOR/PROVIDER/CAUSE OF 2.55 ad revenue ⊂BGV:Cause(d-by), ⊂L:Cause2, ⊂N:Effect Purpose/Activity Group PERFORM/ENGAGE_IN 13.24 cooking pot ⊃BGV:Purpose, ⊃L:For, ≈N:Purpose, ⊃W:Activity∪Purpose CREATE/PROVIDE/SELL 8.94 nicotine patch ∞BV:Purpose, ⊂BG:Result, ∞G:Make-Produce, ⊂GNV:Cause(s),","∞L:Cause1∪Make1∪For, ⊂N:Product, ⊃W:Activity∪Purpose OBTAIN/ACCESS/SEEK 1.50 shrimp boat ⊃BGNV:Purpose, ⊃L:For, ⊃W:Activity∪Purpose MODIFY/PROCESS/CHANGE 1.50 eye surgery ⊃BGNV:Purpose, ⊃L:For, ⊃W:Activity∪Purpose MITIGATE/OPPOSE/DESTROY 2.34 flak jacket ⊃BGV:Purpose, ⊃L:For, ≈N:Detraction, ⊃W:Activity∪Purpose ORGANIZE/SUPERVISE/AUTHORITY 4.82 ethics board ⊃BGNV:Purpose/Topic, ⊃L:For/Abouta, ⊃W:Activity PROPEL 0.16 water gun ⊃BGNV:Purpose, ⊃L:For, ⊃W:Activity∪Purpose PROTECT/CONSERVE 0.25 screen saver ⊃BGNV:Purpose, ⊃L:For, ⊃W:Activity∪Purpose TRANSPORT/TRANSFER/TRADE 1.92 freight train ⊃BGNV:Purpose, ⊃L:For, ⊃W:Activity∪Purpose TRAVERSE/VISIT 0.11 tree traversal ⊃BGNV:Purpose, ⊃L:For, ⊃W:Activity∪Purpose Ownership, Experience, Employment, and Use POSSESSOR + OWNED/POSSESSED 2.11 family estate ⊃BGNVW:Possess*, ⊃L:Have2 EXPERIENCER + COGINITION/MENTAL 0.45 voter concern ⊃BNVW:Possess*, ≈G:Experiencer, ⊃L:Have2 EMPLOYER + EMPLOYEE/VOLUNTEER 2.72 team doctor ⊃BGNVW:Possess*, ⊃L:For/Have2, ⊃BGN:Beneficiary CONSUMER + CONSUMED 0.09 cat food ⊃BGNVW:Purpose, ⊃L:For, ⊃BGN:Beneficiary USER/RECIPIENT + USED/RECEIVED 1.02 voter guide ⊃BNVW:Purpose, ⊃G:Recipient, ⊃L:For, ⊃BGN:Beneficiary OWNED/POSSESSED + POSSESSION 1.20 store owner ≈G:Possession, ⊃L:Have1, ≈W:Belonging-Possessor EXPERIENCE + EXPERIENCER 0.27 fire victim ≈G:Experiencer, ∞L:Have1 THING CONSUMED + CONSUMER 0.41 fruit fly ⊃W:Obj-SingleBeing THING/MEANS USED + USER 1.96 faith healer ≈BNV:Instrument, ≈G:Means∪Instrument, ≈L:Use,","⊂W:MotivePower-Obj Temporal Group TIME [SPAN] + X 2.35 night work ≈BNV:Time(At), ⊃G:Temporal, ≈L:Inc, ≈W:Time-Obj X + TIME [SPAN] 0.50 birth date ⊃G:Temporal, ≈W:Obj-Time Location and Whole+Part/Member of LOCATION/GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF X 4.99 hillside home ≈BGV:Locat(ion/ive), ≈L:Ina∪Fromb, B:Source,","≈N:Location(At/From), ≈W:Place-Obj∪PlaceOfOrigin WHOLE + PART/MEMBER OF 1.75 robot arm ⊃B:Possess*, ≈G:Part-Whole, ⊃L:Have2, ≈N:Part,","≈V:Whole-Part, ≈W:Obj-Part∪Group-Member Composition and Containment Group SUBSTANCE/MATERIAL/INGREDIENT + WHOLE 2.42 plastic bag ⊂BNVW:Material*, ∞GN:Source, ∞L:Froma, ≈L:Have1,","∞L:Make2b, ∞N:Content PART/MEMBER + COLLECTION/CONFIG/SERIES 1.78 truck convoy ≈L:Make2ac, ≈N:Whole, ≈V:Part-Whole, ≈W:Parts-Whole X + SPATIAL CONTAINER/LOCATION/BOUNDS 1.39 shoe box ⊃B:Content∪Located, ⊃L:For, ⊃L:Have1, ≈N:Location,","≈W:Obj-Place Topic Group TOPIC OF COMMUNICATION/IMAGERY/INFO 8.37 travel story ⊃BGNV:Topic, ⊃L:Aboutab, ⊃W:SubjectMatter, ⊂G:Depiction TOPIC OF PLAN/DEAL/ARRANGEMENT/RULES 4.11 loan terms ⊃BGNV:Topic, ⊃L:Abouta, ⊃W:SubjectMatter TOPIC OF OBSERVATION/STUDY/EVALUATION 1.71 job survey ⊃BGNV:Topic, ⊃L:Abouta, ⊃W:SubjectMatter TOPIC OF COGNITION/EMOTION 0.58 jazz fan ⊃BGNV:Topic, ⊃L:Abouta, ⊃W:SubjectMatter TOPIC OF EXPERT 0.57 policy wonk ⊃BGNV:Topic, ⊃L:Abouta, ⊃W:SubjectMatter TOPIC OF SITUATION 1.64 oil glut ⊃BGNV:Topic, ≈L:Aboutc TOPIC OF EVENT/PROCESS 1.09 lava flow ⊃G:Theme, ⊃V:Subj Attribute Group TOPIC/THING + ATTRIB 4.13 street name ⊃BNV:Possess*, ≈G:Property, ⊃L:Have2, ≈W:Obj-Quality TOPIC/THING + ATTRIB VALUE CHARAC OF 0.31 earth tone Attributive and Coreferential COREFERENTIAL 4.51 fighter plane ≈BV:Equative, ⊃G:Type∪IS-A, ≈L:BEbcd, ≈N:Type∪Equality,","≈W:Copula PARTIAL ATTRIBUTE TRANSFER 0.69 skeleton crew ≈W:Resemblance, ⊃G:Type MEASURE + WHOLE 4.37 hour meeting ≈G:Measure, ⊂N:TimeThrough∪Measure, ≈W:Size-Whole Other HIGHLY LEXICALIZED / FIXED PAIR 0.65 pig iron OTHER 1.67 contact lens Table 1: The semantic relations, their frequency in the dataset, examples, and approximate relation mappings to previous relation sets. ≈-approximately equivalent; ⊃/⊂-super/sub set; ∞-some overlap; ∪-union; initials BGLNVW refer respectively to the works of (Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998; Girju et al., 2005; Girju, 2007; Levi, 1978; Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003; Vanderwende, 1994; Warren, 1978). 680 tions and examples. Turkers were asked to select one or, if they deemed it appropriate, two categories for each noun pair. After all annotations for the round were completed, they were examined, and any taxonomic changes deemed appropriate (e.g., the creation, deletion, and/or modification of categories) were incorporated into the taxonomy before the next set of 100 was uploaded. The categories were substantially modified during this process. They are shown in Table 1 along with examples and an approximate mapping to several other taxonomies. 3.2 Category Descriptions Our categories are defined with sentences. For example, the SUBSTANCE category has the definition n1 is one of the primary physical substances/materials/ingredients that n2 is made/composed out of/from. Our LOCATION category’s definition reads n1 is the location / geographic scope where n2 is at, near, from, generally found, or occurs. Defining the categories with sentences is advantageous because it is possible to create straightforward, explicit defintions that humans can easily test examples against. 3.3 Taxonomy Groupings In addition to influencing the category definitions, some taxonomy groupings were altered with the hope that this would improve inter-annotator agreement for cases where Turker disagreement was systematic. For example, LOCATION and WHOLE + PART/MEMBER OF were commonly dis-agreed upon by Turkers so they were placed within their own taxonomic subgroup. The ambiguity between these categories has previously been observed by Girju (2009).","Turkers also tended to disagree between the categories related to composition and containment. Due this apparent similarity they were also grouped together in the taxonomy.","The ATTRIBUTE categories are positioned near the TOPIC group because some Turkers chose a TOPIC category when an ATTRIBUTE category was deemed more appropriate. This may be because attributes are relatively abstract concepts that are often somewhat descriptive of whatever possesses them. A prime example of this is street name. 3.4 Contrast with other Taxonomies In order to ensure completeness, we mapped into our taxonomy the relations proposed in most previous work including those of Barker and Szpakowicz (1998) and Girju et al. (2005). The results, shown in Table 1, demonstrate that our taxonomy is similar to several taxonomies used in other work. However, there are three main differences and several less important ones. The first major difference is the absence of a significant THEME or OBJECT category. The second main difference is that our taxonomy does not include a PURPOSE category and, instead, has several smaller categories. Finally, instead of possessing a single TOPIC category, our taxonomy has several, finer-grainedTOPIC categories. These differences are significant because THEME/OBJECT, PURPOSE, and TOPIC are typically among the most frequent categories.","THEME/OBJECT is typically the category to which other researchers assign noun compounds whose head noun is a nominalized verb and whose modifier noun is the THEME/OBJECT of the verb. This is typically done with the justification that the relation/predicate (the root verb of the nominalization) is overtly expressed.","While including a THEME/OBJECT category has the advantage of simplicity, its disadvantages are significant. This category leads to a significant ambiguity in examples because many compounds fitting the THEME/OBJECT category also match some other category as well. Warren (1978) gives the examples of soup pot and soup container to illustrate this issue, and Girju (2009) notes a substantial overlap between THEME and MAKE-PRODUCE. Our results from Mechanical Turk showed significant overlap betweenPURPOSE and OBJECT categories (present in an earlier version of the taxonomy). For this reason, we do not include a separate THEME/OBJECT category. If it is important to know whether the modifier also holds a THEME/OBJECT relationship, we suggest treating this as a separate classification task.","The absence of a single PURPOSE category is another distinguishing characteristic of our taxonomy. Instead, the taxonomy includes a number of finer-grained categories (e.g., PER-FORM/ENGAGE_IN), which can be conflated to create a PURPOSE category if necessary. During our Mechanical Turk-based refinement process, our now-defunct PURPOSE category was found to be ambiguous with many other categories as well as difficult to define. This problem has been noted by others. For example, Warren (1978) 681 points out that tea in tea cup qualifies as both the content and the purpose of the cup. Similarly, while WHOLE+PART/MEMBER was selected by most Turkers for bike tire, one individual chose PURPOSE. Our investigation identified five main purpose-like relations that most of our PURPOSE examples can be divided into, including activity performance (PERFORM/ENGAGE_IN), creation/provision (CREATE/PROVIDE/CAUSE OF), obtainment/access (OBTAIN/ACCESS/SEEK), supervision/management (ORGA-NIZE/SUPERVISE/AUTHORITY), and opposition (MITIGATE/OPPOSE/DESTROY).","The third major distinguishing different between our taxonomy and others is the absence of a single TOPIC/ABOUT relation. Instead, our taxonomy has several finer-grained categories that can be conflated into a TOPIC category. Unlike the previous two distinguishing characteristics, which were motivated primarily by Turker annotations, this separation was largely motivated by author dissatisfaction with a single TOPIC category.","Two differentiating characteristics of less importance are the absence of BENEFICIARY or SOURCE categories (Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998; Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003; Girju et al., 2005). Our EMPLOYER, CONSUMER, and USER/RECIPIENT categories combined more or less cover BENEFICIARY. Since SOURCE is ambiguous in multiple ways including causation (tsunami injury), provision (government grant), ingredients (rice wine), and locations (north wind), we chose to exclude it."]},{"title":"4 Dataset","paragraphs":["Our noun compound dataset was created from two principal sources: an in-house collection of terms extracted from a large corpus using part-of-speech tagging and mutual information and the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank. Compounds including one or more proper nouns were ignored. In total, the dataset contains 17509 unique, out-of-context examples, making it by far the largest hand-annotated compound noun dataset in existence that we are aware of. Proper nouns were not included.","The next largest available datasets have a variety of drawbacks for noun compound interpretation in general text. Kim and Baldwin’s (2005) dataset is the second largest available dataset, but inter-annotator agreement was only 52.3%, and the annotations had an usually lopsided distribu-tion; 42% of the data has TOPIC labels. Most (73.23%) of Girju’s (2007) dataset consists of noun-preposition-noun constructions. Rosario and Heart’s (2001) dataset is specific to the biomedical domain, while Ó Séaghdha and Copestake’s (2009) data is labeled with only 5 extremely coarse-grained categories.

Table 3 describes the extracted n-gram features. 5.2 Cross Validation Experiments We performed 10-fold cross validation on our dataset, and, for the purpose of comparison, we also performed 5-fold cross validation on Ó Séaghdha’s (2007) dataset using his folds.

The WordNet gloss terms had a surprisingly strong influence.

In the future, it may be valuable to add definition words from other machine-readable dictionaries. The influence of the Web 1T n-gram features was somewhat mixed.

The terms were selected based upon their frequency (i.e., a compound occurring twice as often as another is twice as likely to be selected) to label for testing purposes. Using a heuristic similar to that used by Lauer (1995), we only extracted binary noun compounds not part of a larger sequence. Before reaching the 150 mark, we discarded 94 of the drawn examples because they were included in the training set. Thus, our training set covers roughly 38.5% of the binary noun compound instances in recent New York Times articles. 6.2 Annotators Due to the relatively high speed and low cost of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service, we chose to use Mechanical Turkers as our annotators.","Using Mechanical Turk to obtain inter-annotator agreement figures has several drawbacks. The first and most significant drawback is that it is impossible to force each Turker to label every data point without putting all the terms onto a single web page, which is highly impractical for a large taxonomy. Some Turkers may label every compound, but most do not. Second, while we requested that Turkers only work on our task if English was their first language, we had no method of enforcing this. Third, Turker annotation quality varies considerably. 6.3 Combining Annotators To overcome the shortfalls of using Turkers for an inter-annotator agreement study, we chose to request ten annotations per noun compound and then combine the annotations into a single set of selec-tions using a weighted voting scheme. To combine the results, we calculated a “quality” score for each Turker based upon how often he/she agreed with the others. This score was computed as the average percentage of other Turkers who agreed with his/her annotations. The score for each label for a particular compound was then computed as the sum of the Turker quality scores of the Turkers 684 who annotated the compound. Finally, the label with the highest rating was selected. 6.4 Inter-annotator Agreement Results The raw agreement scores along with Cohen’s κ (Cohen, 1960), a measure of inter-annotator agreement that discounts random chance, were calculated against the authors’ labeling of the data for each Turker, the weighted-voting annotation set, and the automatic classification output. These statistics are reported in Table 5 along with the individual Turker “quality” scores. The 54 Turkers who made fewer than 3 annotations were excluded from the calculations under the assumption that they were not dedicated to the task, leaving a total of 49 Turkers. Due to space limitations, only results for Turkers who annotated 15 or more instances are included in Table 5.","We recomputed the κ statistics after conflating the category groups in two different ways. The first variation involved conflating all the TOPIC categories into a single topic category, resulting in a total of 37 categories (denoted by κ* in Table 5). For the second variation, in addition to conflating the TOPIC categories, we conflated the ATTRIBUTE categories into a single category and the PURPOSE/ACTIVITY categories into a single category, for a total of 27 categories (denoted by κ** in Table 5). 6.5 Results Discussion The .57-.67 κ figures achieved by the Voted annotations compare well with previously reported inter-annotator agreement figures for noun compounds using fine-grained taxonomies. Kim and Baldwin (2005) report an agreement of 52.31% (not κ) for their dataset using Barker and Szpakowicz’s (1998) 20 semantic relations. Girju et al. (2005) report .58 κ using a set of 35 semantic relations, only 21 of which were used, and a .80 κ score using Lauer’s 8 prepositional para-phrases. Girju (2007) reports .61 κ agreement using a similar set of 22 semantic relations for noun compound annotation in which the annotators are shown translations of the compound in for-eign languages. Ó Séaghdha (2007) reports a .68 κ for a relatively small set of relations (BE, HAVE, IN, INST, ACTOR, ABOUT) after removing compounds with non-specific associations or high lexicalization.

It is also important to remember that the training set covers a large portion of the two-word noun compound instances in recent New York Times articles, so substantially higher accuracy can be expected on many texts. Interestingly, conflating categories only improved the κ statistics for the Turkers, not the automatic classifier."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we present a novel, fine-grained taxonomy of 43 noun-noun semantic relations, the largest annotated noun compound dataset yet created, and a supervised classification method for automatic noun compound interpretation.","We describe our taxonomy and provide mappings to taxonomies used by others. Our inter-annotator agreement study, which utilized nonexperts, shows good inter-annotator agreement 685 given the difficulty of the task, indicating that our category definitions are relatively straightforward. Our taxonomy provides wide coverage, with only 2.32% of our dataset marked as other/lexicalized and 2.67% of our 150 inter-annotator agreement data marked as such by the combined Turker (Voted) annotation set.","We demonstrated the effectiveness of a straightforward, supervised classification approach to noun compound interpretation that uses a large variety of boolean features. We also examined the importance of the different features, noting a novel and very useful set of features—the words comprising the definitions of the individual words."]},{"title":"8 Future Work","paragraphs":["In the future, we plan to focus on the interpretation of noun compounds with 3 or more nouns, a problem that includes bracketing noun compounds into their dependency structures in addition to noun-noun semantic relation interpretation. Further-more, we would like to build a system that can handle longer noun phrases, including prepositions and possessives.","We would like to experiment with including features from various other lexical resources to determine their usefulness for this problem.","Eventually, we would like to expand our data set and relations to cover proper nouns as well. We are hopeful that our current dataset and relation definitions, which will be made available via http://www.isi.edu will be helpful to other researchers doing work regarding text semantics."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["Stephen Tratz is supported by a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Ahn, K., J.
