Merialdo (1994), in a now famous negative result, attempted to improve HMM POS tagging by expectation maximization with unlabeled data. Clark et al. (2003) reported positive results with little labeled training data but negative results when the amount of labeled training data increased; the same seems to be the case in Wang et al. (2007) who use co-training of two diverse POS taggers. Huang et al. (2009) present positive results for self-training a simple bigram POS tagger, but results are considerably below state-of-the-art.","Recently researchers have explored alternative methods. Suzuki and Isozaki (2008) introduce a semi-supervised extension of conditional random fields that combines supervised and unsupervised probability models by so-called MDF parameter estimation, which reduces error on Wall Street Journal (WSJ) standard splits by about 7% relative to their supervised baseline. Spoustova et al. (2009) use a new pool of unlabeled data tagged by an ensemble of state-of-the-art taggers in every training step of an averaged perceptron POS tagger with 4–5% error reduction. Finally, Søgaard (2009) stacks a POS tagger on an unsupervised clustering algorithm trained on large amounts of unlabeled data with mixed results.","This work combines a new semi-supervised learning method to POS tagging, namely tri-training (Li and Zhou, 2005), with stacking on unsupervised clustering. It is shown that this method can be used to improve a state-of-the-art POS tagger, SVMTool (Gimenez and Marquez, 2004). Finally, we introduce a variant of tri-training called tri-training with disagreement, which seems to perform equally well, but which imports much less unlabeled data and is therefore more efficient."]},{"title":"2 Tagging as classification","paragraphs":["This section describes our dataset and our input tagger. We also describe how stacking is used to reduce POS tagging to a classification task. Finally, we introduce the supervised learning algorithms used in our experiments. 2.1 Data We use the POS-tagged WSJ from the Penn Treebank Release 3 (Marcus et al., 1993) with the standard split: Sect. 0–18 is used for training, Sect. 19–21 for development, and Sect. 22–24 for testing. Since we need to train our classifiers on material distinct from the training material for our input POS tagger, we save Sect. 19 for training our classifiers. Finally, we use the (untagged) Brown corpus as our unlabeled data. The number of tokens we use for training, developing and testing the classifiers, and the amount of unlabeled data available to it, are thus:","tokens train 44,472 development 103,686 test 129,281 unlabeled 1,170,811 205","The amount of unlabeled data available to our classifiers is thus a bit more than 25 times the amount of labeled data. 2.2 Input tagger In our experiments we use SVMTool (Gimenez and Marquez, 2004) with model type 4 run incrementally in both directions. SVMTool has an accuracy of 97.15% on WSJ Sect. 22-24 with this parameter setting. Gimenez and Marquez (2004) report that SVMTool has an accuracy of 97.16% with an optimized parameter setting. 2.3 Classifier input The way classifiers are constructed in our experiments is very simple. We train SVMTool and an unsupervised tagger, Unsupos (Biemann, 2006), on our training sections and apply them to the development, test and unlabeled sections. The results are combined in tables that will be the input of our classifiers. Here is an excerpt:1 Gold standard SVMTool Unsupos DT DT 17 NNP NNP 27 NNP NNS 17* NNP NNP 17 VBD VBD 26","Each row represents a word and lists the gold standard POS tag, the predicted POS tag and the word cluster selected by Unsupos. For example, the first word is labeled ’DT’, which SVMTool correctly predicts, and it belongs to cluster 17 of about 500 word clusters. The first column is blank in the table for the unlabeled section.","Generally, the idea is that a classifier will learn to trust SVMTool in some cases, but that it may also learn that if SVMTool predicts a certain tag for some word cluster the correct label is another tag. This way of combining taggers into a single end classifier can be seen as a form of stacking (Wolpert, 1992). It has the advantage that it reduces POS tagging to a classification task. This may simplify semi-supervised learning considerably. 2.4 Learning algorithms We assume some knowledge of supervised learning algorithms. Most of our experiments are implementations of wrapper methods that call off-","1","The numbers provided by Unsupos refer to clusters; ”*” marks out-of-vocabulary words. the-shelf implementations of supervised learning algorithms. Specifically we have experimented with support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, bagging and random forests. Tri-training, explained below, is a semi-supervised learning method which requires large amounts of data. Consequently, we only used very fast learning algorithms in the context of tri-training. On the development section, decisions trees performed better than bagging and random forests. The decision tree algorithm is the C4.5 algorithm first introduced in Quinlan (1993). We used SVMs with polynomial kernels of degree 2 to provide a stronger stacking-only baseline."]},{"title":"3 Tri-training","paragraphs":["This section first presents the tri-training algorithm originally proposed by Li and Zhou (2005) and then considers a novel variant: tri-training with disagreement.","Let L denote the labeled data and U the unlabeled data. Assume that three classifiersc1, c2, c3 (same learning algorithm) have been trained on three bootstrap samples of L. In tri-training, an unlabeled datapoint in U is now labeled for a classifier, say c1, if the other two classifiers agree on its label, i.e. c2 and c3. Two classifiers inform the third. If the two classifiers agree on a labeling, there is a good chance that they are right. The algorithm stops when the classifiers no longer change. The three classifiers are combined by majority voting. Li and Zhou (2005) show that under certain conditions the increase in classification noise rate is compensated by the amount of newly labeled data points.","The most important condition is that the three classifiers are diverse. If the three classifiers are identical, tri-training degenerates to self-training. Diversity is obtained in Li and Zhou (2005) by training classifiers on bootstrap samples. In their experiments, they consider classifiers based on the C4.5 algorithm, BP neural networks and naive Bayes classifiers. The algorithm is sketched in a simplified form in Figure 1; see Li and Zhou (2005) for all the details.","Tri-training has to the best of our knowledge not been applied to POS tagging before, but it has been applied to other NLP classification tasks, incl. Chinese chunking (Chen et al., 2006) and question classification (Nguyen et al., 2008). 206 1: for i ∈ {1..3} do 2: Si ← bootstrap sample(L) 3: ci ← train classifier (Si) 4: end for 5: repeat 6: for i ∈ {1..3} do 7: for x ∈ U do 8: Li ← ∅ 9: if cj(x) = ck(x)(j, k ̸= i) then 10: Li ← Li ∪ {(x, cj(x)} 11: end if 12: end for 13: ci ← train classifier (L ∪ Li) 14: end for 15: until none of ci changes 16: apply majority vote over ci Figure 1: Tri-training (Li and Zhou, 2005). 3.1 Tri-training with disagreement We introduce a possible improvement of the tri-training algorithm: If we change lines 9–10 in the algorithm in Figure 1 with the lines: if cj(x) = ck(x) ̸= ci(x)(j, k ̸= i) then","Li ← Li ∪ {(x, cj(x)} end if","two classifiers, sayc1 and c2, only label a datapoint for the third classifier,c3, if c1 and c2 agree on its label, but c3 disagrees. The intuition is that we only want to strengthen a classifier in its weak points, and we want to avoid skewing our labeled data by easy data points. Finally, since tri-training with disagreement imports less unlabeled data, it is much more efficient than tri-training. No one has to the best of our knowledge applied tri-training with disagreement to real-life classification tasks before."]},{"title":"4 Results","paragraphs":["Our results are presented in Figure 2. The stacking result was obtained by training a SVM on top of the predictions of SVMTool and the word clusters of Unsupos. SVMs performed better than decision trees, bagging and random forests on our development section, but improvements on test data were modest. Tri-training refers to the original algorithm sketched in Figure 1 with C4.5 as learning algorithm. Since tri-training degenerates to self-training if the three classifiers are trained on the same sample, we used our implementation of tri-training to obtain self-training results and validated our results by a simpler implementation. We varied poolsize to optimize self-training. Finally, we list results for a technique called co-forests (Li and Zhou, 2007), which is a recent alternative to tri-training presented by the same authors, and for tri-training with disagreement (tri-disagr). The pvalues are computed using 10,000 stratified shuffles.","Tri-training and tri-training with disagreement gave the best results. Note that since tri-training leads to much better results than stacking alone, it is unlabeled data that gives us most of the improvement, not the stacking itself. The difference between tri-training and self-training is nearsignificant (p <0.0150). It seems that tri-training with disagreement is a competitive technique in terms of accuracy. The main advantage of tri-training with disagreement compared to ordinary tri-training, however, is that it is very efficient. This is reflected by the average number of tokens in Li over the three learners in the worst round of learning:","av. tokens in Li tri-training 1,170,811 tri-disagr 173","Note also that self-training gave very good results. Self-training was, again, much slower than tri-training with disagreement since we had to train on a large pool of unlabeled data (but only once). Of course this is not a standard self-training set-up, but self-training informed by unsupervised word clusters. 4.1 Follow-up experiments SVMTool is one of the most accurate POS taggers available. This means that the predictions that are added to the labeled data are of very high quality. To test if our semi-supervised learning methods were sensitive to the quality of the input taggers we repeated the self-training and tri-training experiments with a less competitive POS tagger, namely the maximum entropy-based POS tagger first described in (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) that comes with the maximum entropy library in (Zhang, 2004). Results are presented as the second line in Figure 2. Note that error reduction is much lower in this case. 207","BL stacking tri-tr. self-tr. co-forests tri-disagr error red. p-value SVMTool 97.15% 97.19% 97.27% 97.26% 97.13% 97.27% 4.21% <0.0001 MaxEnt 96.31% - 96.36% 96.36% 96.28% 96.36% 1.36% <0.0001 Figure 2: Results on Wall Street Journal Sect. 22-24 with different semi-supervised methods."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper first shows how stacking can be used to reduce POS tagging to a classification task. This reduction seems to enable robust semi-supervised learning. The technique was used to improve the accuracy of a state-of-the-art POS tagger, namely SVMTool. Four semi-supervised learning methods were tested, incl. self-training, tri-training, co-forests and tri-training with disagreement. All methods increased the accuracy of SVMTool significantly. Error reduction on Wall Street Journal Sect. 22-24 was 4.2%, which is comparable to related work in the literature, e.g. Suzuki and Isozaki (2008) (7%) and Spoustova et al.
