In this paper, we formulate extractive summarization as a two step learning problem building a generative model for pattern discovery and a regression model for inference. We calculate scores for sentences in document clusters based on their latent characteristics using a hierarchical topic model. Then, using these scores, we train a regression model based on the lexical and structural characteristics of the sentences, and use the model to score sentences of new documents to form a summary. Our system advances current state-of-the-art improving ROUGE scores by ∼7%. Generated summaries are less redundant and more coherent based upon manual quality evaluations."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Extractive approach to multi-document summarization (MDS) produces a summary by select-ing sentences from original documents. Document Understanding Conferences (DUC), now TAC, fosters the effort on building MDS systems, which take document clusters (documents on a same topic) and description of the desired summary focus as input and output a word length limited summary. Human summaries are provided for training summarization models and measuring the performance of machine generated summaries.","Extractive summarization methods can be classified into two groups: supervised methods that rely on provided document-summary pairs, and unsupervised methods based upon properties derived from document clusters. Supervised methods treat the summarization task as a classifica-tion/regression problem, e.g., (Shen et al., 2007; Yeh et al., 2005). Each candidate sentence is classified as summary or non-summary based on the features that they pose and those with highest scores are selected. Unsupervised methods aim to score sentences based on semantic groupings extracted from documents, e.g., (DauméIII and Marcu, 2006; Titov and McDonald, 2008; Tang et al., 2009; Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009; Radev et al., 2004; Branavan et al., 2009), etc. Such models can yield comparable or better performance on DUC and other evaluations, since representing documents as topic distributions rather than bags of words diminishes the effect of lexical variability. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous research which utilizes the best features of both approaches for MDS as presented in this paper.","In this paper, we present a novel approach that formulates MDS as a prediction problem based on a two-step hybrid model: a generative model for hierarchical topic discovery and a regression model for inference. We investigate if a hierarchical model can be adopted to discover salient characteristics of sentences organized into hierarchies utilizing human generated summary text.","We present a probabilistic topic model on sentence level building on hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (hLDA) (Blei et al., 2003a), which is a generalization of LDA (Blei et al., 2003b). We construct a hybrid learning algorithm by extracting salient features to characterize summary sentences, and implement a regression model for inference (Fig.3). Contributions of this work are: − construction of hierarchical probabilistic model designed to discover the topic structures of all sentences. Our focus is on identifying similarities of candidate sentences to summary sentences using a novel tree based sentence scoring algorithm, concerning topic distributions at different levels of the discovered hierarchy as described in § 3 and § 4, − representation of sentences by meta-features to 815 characterize their candidacy for inclusion in summary text. Our aim is to find features that can best represent summary sentences as described in § 5, − implementation of a feasible inference method based on a regression model to enable scoring of sentences in test document clusters without re-training, (which has not been investigated in generative summarization models) described in § 5.2.","We show in § 6 that our hybrid summarizer achieves comparable (if not better) ROUGE score on the challenging task of extracting the summaries of multiple newswire documents. The human evaluations confirm that our hybrid model can produce coherent and non-redundant summaries."]},{"title":"2 Background and Motivation","paragraphs":["There are many studies on the principles govern-ing multi-document summarization to produce coherent and semantically relevant summaries. Previous work (Nenkova and Vanderwende, 2005; Conroy et al., 2006), focused on the fact that frequency of words plays an important factor. While, earlier work on summarization depend on a word score function, which is used to measure sentence rank scores based on (semi-)supervised learning methods, recent trend of purely data-driven methods, (Barzilay and Lee, 2004; DauméIII and Marcu, 2006; Tang et al., 2009; Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009), have shown remarkable improvements. Our work builds on both methods by constructing a hybrid approach to summarization.","Our objective is to discover from document clusters, the latent topics that are organized into hierarchies following (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009). A hierarchical model is particularly appealing to summarization than a ”flat” model, e.g. LDA (Blei et al., 2003b), in that one can discover ”abstract” and ”specific” topics. For instance, discovering that ”baseball” and ”football” are both contained in an abstract class ”sports” can help to identify summary sentences. It follows that summary topics are commonly shared by many documents, while specific topics are more likely to be mentioned in rather a small subset of documents.","Feature based learning approaches to summarization methods discover salient features by measuring similarity between candidate sentences and summary sentences (Nenkova and Vanderwende, 2005; Conroy et al., 2006). While such methods are effective in extractive summarization, the fact that some of these methods are based on greedy algorithms can limit the application areas. More-over, using information on the hidden semantic structure of document clusters would improve the performance of these methods.","Recent studies focused on the discovery of latent topics of document sets in extracting summaries. In these models, the challenges of inferring topics of test documents are not addressed in detail. One of the challenges of using a previously trained topic model is that the new document might have a totally new vocabulary or may include many other specific topics, which may or may not exist in the trained model. A common method is to re-build a topic model for new sets of documents (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009), which has proven to produce coherent summaries. An alternative yet feasible solution, presented in this work, is building a model that can summarize new document clusters using characteristics of topic distributions of training documents. Our approach differs from the early work, in that, we combine a generative hierarchical model and regression model to score sentences in new documents, eliminating the need for building a generative model for new document clusters."]},{"title":"3 Summary-Focused Hierarchical Model","paragraphs":["Our MDS system, hybrid hierarchical summarizer, HybHSum, is based on an hybrid learning approach to extract sentences for generating summary. We discover hidden topic distributions of sentences in a given document cluster along with provided summary sentences based on hLDA described in (Blei et al., 2003a)1",". We build a summary-focused hierarchical probabilistic topic model, sumHLDA, for each document cluster at sentence level, because it enables capturing expected topic distributions in given sentences directly from the model. Besides, document clusters contain a relatively small number of documents, which may limit the variability of topics if they are evaluated on the document level. As described in § 4, we present a new method for scoring candidate sentences from this hierarchical structure.","Let a given document cluster D be represented with sentences O={om}|O|","m=1 and its corresponding human summary be represented with sentences S={sn}|S|","n=1. All sentences are comprised of words V = { w1, w2, ..w|V | } in {O ∪ S}. 1 Please refer to (Blei et al., 2003b) and (Blei et al., 2003a)","for details and demonstrations of topic models. 816","Summary hLDA (sumHLDA): The hLDA represents distribution of topics in sentences by organizing topics into a tree of a fixed depth L (Fig.1.a). Each candidate sentence om is assigned to a path com in the tree and each word wi in a given sentence is assigned to a hidden topic zom at a level l of com. Each node is associated with a topic distribution over words. The sampler method alternates between choosing a new path for each sentence through the tree and assigning each word in each sentence to a topic along that path. The structure of tree is learnt along with the topics using a nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP) (Blei et al., 2003a), which is used as a prior.","The nCRP is a stochastic process, which as-signs probability distributions to infinitely branch-ing and infinitely deep trees. In our model, nCRP specifies a distribution of words into paths in an L-level tree. The assignments of sentences to paths are sampled sequentially: The first sentence takes the initial L-level path, starting with a single branch tree. Later, mth subsequent sentence is assigned to a path drawn from the distribution:","p(pathold, c|m, mc) = mc","γ+m−1","p(pathnew, c|m, mc) = γ","γ+m−1 (1) pathold and pathnew represent an existing and novel (branch) path consecutively, mc is the number of previous sentences assigned to path c, m is the total number of sentences seen so far, and γ is a hyper-parameter which controls the probability of creating new paths. Based on this probability each node can branch out a different number of child nodes proportional to γ. Small values of γ suppress the number of branches.","Summary sentences generally comprise abstract concepts of the content. With sumHLDA we want to capture these abstract concepts in candidate sentences. The idea is to represent each path shared by similar candidate sentences with representative summary sentence(s). We let summary sentences share existing paths generated by similar candidate sentences instead of sampling new paths and influence the tree structure by introducing two separate hyper-parameters for nCRP prior: • if a summary sentence is sampled, use γ = γs, • if a candidate sentence is sampled, use γ = γo.","At each node, we let summary sentences sample a path by choosing only from the existing children of that node with a probability proportional to the number of other sentences assigned to that child. This can be achieved by using a small value for γs (0 < γs ≪ 1). We only let candidate sentences to have an option of creating a new child node with a probability proportional to γo. By choosing γs ≪ γo we suppress the generation of new branches for summary sentences and modify the γ of nCRP prior in Eq.(1) using γs and γo hyper-parameters for different sentence types. In the experiments, we discuss the effects of this modifica-tion on the hierarchical topic tree.","The following is the generative process for sumHLDA used in our HybHSum : (1) For each topic k ∈ T , sample a distribution βk ∽ Dirichlet(η). (2) For each sentence d ∈ {O ∪ S},","(a) if d ∈ O, draw a path cd ∽ nCRP(γo),","else if d ∈ S, draw a path cd ∽ nCRP(γs).","(b) Sample L-vector θd mixing weights from","Dirichlet distribution θd ∼ Dir(α).","(c) For each word n, choose: (i) level zd,n|θd","and (ii) word wd,n| {zd,n, cd, β}","Given sentence d, θd is a vector of topic proportions from L dimensional Dirichlet parameter-ized by α (distribution over levels in the tree.) The nth word of d is sampled by first choosing a level zd,n = l from the discrete distribution θd with probability θd,l. Dirichlet parameter η and γo control the size of tree effecting the number of topics. (Small values of γs do not effect the tree.) Large values of η favor more topics (Blei et al., 2003a).","Model Learning: Gibbs sampling is a common method to fit the hLDA models. The aim is to ob-tain the following samples from the posterior of: (i) the latent tree T , (ii) the level assignment z for all words, (iii) the path assignments c for all sentences conditioned on the observed words w.","Given the assignment of words w to levels z and assignments of sentences to paths c, the expected posterior probability of a particular word w at a given topic z=l of a path c=c is proportional to the number of times w was generated by that topic: p(w|z, c, w, η) ∝ n(z=l,c=c,w=w) + η (2) Similarly, posterior probability of a particular topic z in a given sentence d is proportional to number of times z was generated by that sentence: p(z|z, c, α) ∝ n(c=cd,z=l) + α (3) n(.) is the count of elements of an array satisfy-ing the condition. Note from Eq.(3) that two sentences d1 and d2 on the same path c would have 817 different words, and hence different posterior topic probabilities. Posterior probabilities are normalized with total counts and their hyperparameters."]},{"title":"4 Tree-Based Sentence Scoring","paragraphs":["The sumHLDA constructs a hierarchical tree structure of candidate sentences (per document cluster) by positioning summary sentences on the tree. Each sentence is represented by a path in the tree, and each path can be shared by many sentences. The assumption is that sentences sharing the same path should be more similar to each other because they share the same topics. Moreover, if a path includes a summary sentence, then candidate sentences on that path are more likely to be selected for summary text. In particular, the similarity of a candidate sentence om to a summary sentence sn sharing the same path is a measure of strength, indicating how likely om is to be included in the generated summary (Algorithm 1):","Let com be the path for a given om. We find summary sentences that share the same path with om via: M = {sn ∈ S|csn = com}. The score of each sentence is calculated by similarity to the best matching summary sentence in M : score(om) = maxsn∈M sim(om, sn) (4) If M=ø, then score(om)=ø. The efficiency of our similarity measure in identifying the best matching summary sentence, is tied to how expressive the extracted topics of our sumHLDA models are. Given path com, we calculate the similarity of om to each sn, n=1..|M | by measuring similarities on:","⋆ sparse unigram distributions (sim1) at each topic l on com: similarity between p(wom,l|zom = l, com, vl) and p(wsn,l|zsn = l, com, vl)","⋆⋆ distributions of topic proportions (sim2); similarity between p(zom|com) and p(zsn|com).","− sim1: We define two sparse (discrete) unigram distributions for candidate om and summary sn at each node l on a vocabulary identified with words generated by the topic at that node, vl ⊂ V .

The discrete unigram distribution poml = p(wom,l|zom = l, com, vl) represents the probability over all words vl assigned to topic zom at level l, by sampling only for words in wom,l. Similarly, psn,l = p(wsn,l|zsn, com, vl) is the probability of words wsn in sn of the same topic. The probability of each word in pom,l and psn,l are obtained using Eq. (2) and then normalized (see Fig.1.b).

We build a regression model using sentence scores as output and selected salient features as input variables described below: 5.1 Feature Extraction We compile our training dataset using sentences from different document clusters, which do not necessarily share vocabularies. Thus, we create n-gram meta-features to represent sentences instead of word n-gram frequencies:","(I) nGram Meta-Features (NMF): For each document cluster D, we identify most frequent (non-stop word) unigrams, i.e., vfreq = {wi}r","i=1 ⊂ V , where r is a model parameter of number of most frequent unigram features. We measure observed unigram probabilities for each wi ∈ vfreq with pD(wi) = nD(wi)/","∑|V |","j=1 nD(wj), where nD(wi) is the number of times wi appears in D and |V | is the total number of unigrams. For any ith feature, the value is fmi = 0, if given sentence does not contain wi, otherwise fmi = pD(wi). These features can be extended for any n-grams. We similarly include bigram features in the experiments.","(II) Document Word Frequency Meta-Features (DMF): The characteristics of sentences at the document level can be important in summary generation. DMF identify whether a word in a given sentence is specific to the document in consideration or it is commonly used in the document cluster. This is important because summary sentences usually contain abstract terms rather than specific terms.","To characterize this feature, we re-use the r most frequent unigrams, i.e., wi ∈ vfreq. Given sentence om, let d be the document that om be-longs to, i.e., om ∈ d. We measure unigram probabilities for each wi by p(wi ∈ om) = nd(wi ∈ om)/nD(wi), where nd(wi ∈ om) is the number of times wi appears in d and nD(wi) is the number of times wi appears in D. For any ith feature, the value is fmi = 0, if given sentence does not contain wi, otherwise fmi = p(wi ∈ om). We also include bigram extensions of DMF features. 819","(III) Other Features (OF): Term frequency of sentences such as SUMBASIC are proven to be good predictors in sentence scoring (Nenkova and Vanderwende, 2005).

The hLDA is used to capture abstraction and specificity of words in documents (Blei et al., 2009). Contrary to typical hLDA models, to efficiently represent sentences in summarization task, we set ascending values for Dirichlet hyper-parameter η as the level increases, encouraging mid to low level distributions to generate as many words as in higher levels, e.g., for a tree of depth=3, η = {0.125, 0.5, 1}. This causes sentences share paths only when they include similar concepts, starting higher level topics of the tree.

In experiment 3, we use both nCRP priors in HybHSum to analyze whether there is any performance gain with the new prior.","Experiment 2: Feature Selection Analysis Here we test individual contribution of each set of features on our HybHSum (using sumHLDA). We use a Baseline by replacing the scoring algorithm of HybHSum with a simple cosine distance measure.

We train models with DUC2005 and evaluate performance on DUC2006 documents for different parameter values as shown in Table 2. As presented in § 5, NMF is the bundle of frequency based meta-features on document cluster level, DMF is a bundle of frequency based meta-features on individual document level and OF represents sentence term frequency, location, and size features. In comparison to the baseline, OF has a significant effect on the ROUGE scores. In addi-tion, DMF together with OF has shown to improve all scores, in comparison to baseline, on average by 10%. Although the NMF have minimal individual improvement, all these features can statistically improve R-2 without stop words by 12% (significance is measured by t-test statistics).","Experiment 3: ROUGE Evaluations We use the following multi-document summarization models along with the Baseline presented in Experiment 2 to evaluate HybSumm.","⋆ PYTHY : (Toutanova et al., 2007) A state-of-the-art supervised summarization system that ranked first in overall ROUGE evaluations in DUC2007.

Using an approximation for inference, sentences are greedily added to a summary so long as they decrease KL-divergence.","⋆ HybFSum (Hybrid Flat Summarizer): To investigate the performance of hierarchical topic model, we build another hybrid model using flat LDA (Blei et al., 2003b). In LDA each sentence is a superposition of all K topics with sentence specific weights, there is no hierarchical relation between topics. We keep the parameters and the features of the regression model of hierarchical HybHSum intact for consistency. We only change the sentence scoring method. Instead of the new tree-based sentence scoring (§ 4), we present a similar method using topics from LDA on sentence level. Note that in LDA the topic-word distributions φ are over entire vocabulary, and topic mixing proportions for sentences θ are over all the topics discovered from sentences in a document cluster. Hence, we define sim1 and sim2 measures for LDA using topic-word proportions φ (in place of discrete topic-word distributions from each level in Eq.2) and topic mixing weights θ in sentences (in place of topic proportions in Eq.3) respectively. Maximum matching score is calculated as same as in HybHSum. ⋆ HybHSum1 and HybHSum2: To analyze the effect of the new nCRP prior of sumHLDA on sum-821 ROUGE w/o stop words w/ stop words","R-1 R-2 R-4 R-1 R-2 R-4 Baseline 32.4 7.4 10.6 41.0 9.3 15.2 PYTHY 35.7 8.9 12.1 42.6 11.9 16.8 HIERSUM 33.8 9.3 11.6 42.4 11.8 16.7 HybFSum 34.5 8.6 10.9 43.6 9.5 15.7 HybHSum1 34.0 7.9 11.5 44.8 11.0 16.7 HybHSum2 35.1 8.3 11.8 45.6 11.4 17.2 Table 3: ROUGE results of the best systems on DUC2007 dataset (best results are bolded.) marization model performance, we build two different versions of our hybrid model: HybHSum1 using standard hLDA (Blei et al., 2003a) and HybHSum2 using our sumHLDA.","The ROUGE results are shown in Table 3. The HybHSum2 achieves the best performance on R-1 and R-4 and comparable on R-2. When stop words are used the HybHSum2 outperforms state-of-the-art by 2.5-7% except R-2 (with statistical significance). Note that R-2 is a measure of bigram recall and sumHLDA of HybHSum2 is built on unigrams rather than bigrams. Compared to the HybFSum built on LDA, both HybHSum1&2 yield better performance indicating the effective-ness of using hierarchical topic model in summarization task. HybHSum2 appear to be less redundant than HybFSum capturing not only common terms but also specific words in Fig. 2, due to the new hierarchical tree-based sentence scoring which characterizes sentences on deeper level. Similarly, HybHSum1&2 far exceeds baseline built on simple classifier. The results justify the performance gain by using our novel tree-based scoring method. Although the ROUGE scores for HybHSum1 and HybHSum2 are not significantly different, the sumHLDA is more suitable for summarization tasks than hLDA.","HybHSum2 is comparable to (if not better than) fully generative HIERSUM. This indicates that with our regression model built on training data, summaries can be efficiently generated for test documents (suitable for online systems).","Experiment 4: Manual Evaluations Here, we manually evaluate quality of summaries, a common DUC task. Human annotators are given two sets of summary text for each document set, generated from two approaches: best hierarchical hybrid HybHSum2 and flat hybrid HybFSum models, and are asked to mark the better summary New federal rules for organic food will assure consumers that the products are grown and processed to the same standards nationwide. But as sales grew more than 20 percent a year through the 1990s, organic food came to account for $1 of every $100 spent on food, and in 1997 t h e a g e n c y t o o k n o t i c e , proposing national organic standards for all food. By the year 2001, organic products are projected to command 5 percent of total food sales in the United States. The sale of organics rose by about 30 percent last year, driven by concerns over food safety, the environment and a fear of genetically engineered food. U.S. sales of organic foods have grown by 20 percent annually for the last seven years. (c) HybFSum Output (b) HybHSum2 Output The Agriculture Department began to propose standards for all organic foods in the late 1990's because their sale had grown more than 20 per cent a year in that decade. In January 1999 the USDA approved a \"certified organic\" label for meats and poultry that were raised without growth hormones, pesticide-treated feed, and antibiotics. (a) Ref.
