Inspired by the MDL principle, we develop an objective function for generative models that captures the description of the data by the model (log-likelihood) and the description of the model (model size). We also develop a efficient general search algorithm based on the MAP-EM framework to optimize this function. Since recent work has shown that minimizing the model size in a Hidden Markov Model for part-of-speech (POS) tagging leads to higher accuracies, we test our approach by applying it to this problem. The search algorithm involves a simple change to EM and achieves high POS tagging accuracies on both English and Italian data sets."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle is a method for model selection that provides a generic solution to the overfitting problem (Barron et al., 1998). A formalization of Ockham’s Razor, it says that the parameters are to be chosen that minimize the description length of the data given the model plus the description length of the model itself.","It has been successfully shown that minimizing the model size in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for part-of-speech (POS) tagging leads to higher accuracies than simply running the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977). Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) employ a Bayesian approach to POS tagging and use sparse Dirichlet priors to minimize model size. More recently, Ravi and Knight (2009) alternately minimize the model using an integer linear program and maximize likelihood using EM to achieve the highest accuracies on the task so far. However, in the latter approach, because there is no single objective function to optimize, it is not entirely clear how to generalize this technique to other problems. In this paper, inspired by the MDL principle, we develop an objective function for generative models that captures both the description of the data by the model (log-likelihood) and the description of the model (model size). By using a simple prior that encourages sparsity, we cast our problem as a search for the maximum a posteriori (MAP) hypothesis and present a variant of EM to approximately search for the minimum-description-length model. Applying our approach to the POS tagging problem, we obtain higher accuracies than both EM and Bayesian inference as reported by Goldwater and Griffiths (2007). On a Italian POS tagging task, we obtain even larger improvements. We find that our objective function correlates well with accuracy, suggesting that this technique might be useful for other problems."]},{"title":"2 MAP EM with Sparse Priors 2.1 Objective function","paragraphs":["In the unsupervised POS tagging task, we are given a word sequence w = w1, . . . , wN and want to find the best tagging t = t1, . . . , tN, where ti ∈ T , the tag vocabulary. We adopt the problem formulation of Merialdo (1994), in which we are given a dictionary of possible tags for each word type.","We define a bigram HMM P(w, t | θ) = N∏ i=1 P(w, t | θ) · P(ti | ti−1) (1) In maximum likelihood estimation, the goal is to 209 find parameter estimates","θ̂ = arg max θ log P(w | θ) (2)","= arg max θ log ∑ t P(w, t | θ) (3) The EM algorithm can be used to find a solution. However, we would like to maximize likelihood and minimize the size of the model simultaneously. We define the size of a model as the number of non-zero probabilities in its parameter vector. Let θ1, . . . , θn be the components of θ. We would like to find","θ̂ = arg min θ ( − log P(w | θ) + α∥θ∥0 ) (4) where ∥θ∥0, called the L0 norm of θ, simply counts the number of non-zero parameters in θ. The hyperparameter α controls the tradeoff between likelihood maximization and model minimization. Note the similarity of this objective function with MDL’s, where α would be the space (measured in nats) needed to describe one parameter of the model.","Unfortunately, minimization of the L0 norm is known to be NP-hard (Hyder and Mahata, 2009). It is not smooth, making it unamenable to gradient-based optimization algorithms. Therefore, we use a smoothed approximation, ∥θ∥0 ≈ ∑ i ( 1 − e −θ i β ) (5) where 0 < β ≤ 1 (Mohimani et al., 2007). For smaller values of β, this closely approximates the desired function (Figure 1). Inverting signs and ignoring constant terms, our objective function is now:","θ̂ = arg max θ  log P(w | θ) + α ∑ i e −θ i β   (6)","We can think of the approximate model size as a kind of prior: P(θ) = exp α","∑ i e −θ i β Z (7) log P(θ) = α · ∑ i e −θ i β","− log Z (8) where Z = ∫ dθ exp α","∑ i e −θ i β","is a normalization","constant.

However,","for a model which is a product of multinomial dis-","tributions, the L1 norm is a constant. ∑ i |θi| = ∑ i θi = ∑ t  ∑ w P(w | t) + ∑ t′","P(t′ | t)   = 2|T |","Therefore, we cannot use the L1 norm as part of the size term as the result will be the same as the EM algorithm. 210 2.2 Parameter optimization To optimize (11), we use MAP EM, which is an it-erative search procedure. The E step is the same as in standard EM, which is to calculate P(t | w, θt","), where the θt","are the parameters in the current iteration t. The M step in iteration (t + 1) looks like","θt+1 = arg max","θ ( EP(t|w,θt",") [ log P(w, t | θ) ] + αt ∑ t,t′ e −P(t′ |t) β ) (12) Let C(t, w; t, w) count the number of times the word w is tagged as t in t, and C(t, t′","; t) the number of times the tag bigram (t, t′",") appears in t. We can rewrite the M step as","θt+1 = arg max","θ (∑ t ∑ w E[C(t, w)] log P(w | t) + ∑ t ∑ t′","(","E[C(t, t′",")] log P(t′","| t) + αte −P(t′ |t) β )  (13) subject to the constraints","∑ w P(w | t) = 1 and ∑ t′ P(t′","| t) = 1. Note that we can optimize each term of both summations over t separately. For each t, the term","∑ w E[C(t, w)] log P(w | t) (14) is easily optimized as in EM: just let P(w | t) ∝ E[C(t, w)]. But the term ∑ t′","(","E[C(t, t′",")] log P(t′","| t) + αte −P(t′ |t) β ) (15) is trickier. This is a non-convex optimization problem for which we invoke a publicly available constrained optimization tool, ALGENCAN (Andreani et al., 2007). To carry out its optimization, ALGENCAN requires computation of the following in every iteration:","• Objective function, defined in equation (15). This is calculated in polynomial time using dynamic programming. • Constraints: gt = ∑","t′ P(t′","| t) − 1 = 0 for","each tag t ∈ T . Also, we constrain P(t′","| t) to","the interval [ε, 1].1","1","We must have ε > 0 because of the log P(t′","| t) term","in equation (15). It seems reasonable to set ε ≪ 1","N ; in our","experiments, we set ε = 10−7 . • Gradient of objective function: ∂F","∂P(t′","| t) =","E[C(t, t′",")]","P(t′","| t) − αt β e","−P(t′ |t) β","(16) • Gradient of equality constraints: ∂gt","∂P(t′′ | t′",") =    1 if t = t′ 0 otherwise (17)","• Hessian of objective function, which is not required but greatly speeds up the optimization: ∂2","F","∂P(t′ | t)∂P(t′","| t) = −","E[C(t, t′",")]","P(t′","| t)2 + αt e −P(t′ |t) β","β2","(18) The other second-order partial derivatives are all zero, as are those of the equality constraints.

Each Hi comprised about 24, 000 words annotated with POS tags. We ran MAP-EM for 100 iterations, with uniform probability initializa-tion, for a suite of hyperparameters and averaged their tagging accuracies over the three held-out sets. The results are presented in Table 2. We then picked the hyperparameter setting with the highest average accuracy. These were αt = 80, β = 0.05. We then ran MAP-EM again on the test data with these hyperparameters and achieved a tagging accuracy of 87.4% (see Table 1). This is higher than the 85.2% that Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) obtain using Bayesian methods for inferring both POS tags and hyperparameters.
