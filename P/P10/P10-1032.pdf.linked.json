However, most of the syntax based systems construct the syntactic translation rules based on word alignment, which not only suffers from the pipeline errors, but also fails to effectively utilize the syntactic structural features. To address those deficiencies, Tinsley et al. (2007) attempt to directly capture the syntactic translational equivalences by automatically conducting sub-tree alignment, which can be defined as follows:","A sub-tree alignment process pairs up sub-tree pairs across bilingual parse trees whose contexts are semantically translational equivalent. Accord-ing to Tinsley et al. (2007), a sub-tree aligned parse tree pair follows the following criteria:","(i) a node can only be linked once;","(ii) descendants of a source linked node may","only link to descendants of its target","linked counterpart;","(iii) ancestors of a source linked node may on-","ly link to ancestors of its target linked","counterpart.","By sub-tree alignment, translational equivalent sub-tree pairs are coupled as aligned counterparts. Each pair consists of both the lexical constituents and their maximum tree structures generated over the lexical sequences in the original parse trees. Due to the 1-to-1 mapping between sub-trees and tree nodes, sub-tree alignment can also be considered as node alignment by conducting multiple links across the internal nodes as shown in Fig. 1.","Previous studies conduct sub-tree alignments by either using a rule based method or conducting some similarity measurement only based on lexical features. Groves et al. (2004) conduct sub-tree alignment by using some heuristic rules, lack of extensibility and generality. Tinsley et al. (2007)","","Figure 1: Sub-tree alignment as referred to Node alignment 306 and Imamura (2001) propose some score functions based on the lexical similarity and co-occurrence. These works fail to utilize the structural features, rendering the syntactic rich task of sub-tree alignment less convincing and attractive. This may be due to the fact that the syntactic structures in a parse tree pair are hard to describe using plain features. In addition, explicitly utilizing syntactic tree fragments results in exponentially high dimensional feature vectors, which is hard to compute. Alternatively, convolution parse tree kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2001), which implicitly explore the tree structure information, have been successfully applied in many NLP tasks, such as Semantic parsing (Moschitti, 2004) and Relation Extraction (Zhang et al. 2006). However, all those studies are carried out in monolingual tasks. In multilingual tasks such as machine translation, tree kernels are seldom applied.","In this paper, we propose Bilingual Tree Kernels (BTKs) to model the bilingual translational equivalences, in our case, to conduct sub-tree alignment. This is motivated by the decent effectiveness of tree kernels in expressing the similarity between tree structures. We propose two kinds of BTKs named dependent Bilingual Tree Kernel (dBTK), which takes the sub-tree pair as a whole and independent Bilingual Tree Kernel (iBTK), which individually models the source and the target sub-trees. Both kernels can be utilized within different feature spaces using various representations of the sub-structures.","Along with BTKs, various lexical and syntactic structural features are proposed to capture the correspondence between bilingual sub-trees using a polynomial kernel. We then attempt to combine the polynomial kernel and BTKs to construct a composite kernel. The sub-tree alignment task is considered as a binary classification problem. We employ a kernel based classifier with the composite kernel to classify each candidate of sub-tree pair as aligned or unaligned. Then a greedy search algorithm is performed according to the three criteria of sub-tree alignment within the space of candidates classified as aligned.","We evaluate the sub-tree alignment on both the gold standard tree bank and an automatically parsed corpus. Experimental results show that the proposed BTKs benefit sub-tree alignment on both corpora, along with the lexical features and the plain structural features. Further experiments in machine translation also suggest that the obtained sub-tree alignment can improve the performance of both phrase and syntax based SMT systems."]},{"title":"2 Bilingual Tree Kernels","paragraphs":["In this section, we propose the two BTKs and study their capability and complexity in modeling the bilingual structural similarity.

In this section, we propose different sub-structures to facilitate the measurement of syntactic similarity for sub-tree alignment. Since the proposed BTKs can be computed by individually evaluating the source and target monolingual tree kernels, the definition of the sub-structure can be simplified to base only on monolingual sub-trees. 3.1 Subset Tree Motivated from Collins and Duffy (2002) in monolingual tree kernels, the Subset Tree (SST) can be employed as sub-structures. An SST is any subgraph, which includes more than one non-terminal node, with the constraint that the entire rule productions are included. Fig. 2 shows an example of the SSTs decomposed from the source sub-tree rooted at VP*. 3.2 Root directed Subset Tree Monolingual Tree kernels achieve decent performance using the SSTs due to the rich exploration of syntactic information. However, the sub-tree alignment task requires strong capability of discriminating the sub-trees with their roots across adjacent generations, because those candidates share many identical SSTs. As illustrated in Fig 2, the source sub-tree rooted at VP*, which should be aligned to the target sub-tree rooted at NP*, may be likely aligned to the sub-tree rooted at PP*, 308 which shares quite a similar context with NP*. It is also easy to show that the latter shares all the SSTs that the former obtains. In consequence, the values of the SST based kernel function are quite similar between the candidate sub-tree pair rooted at (VP*,NP*) and (VP*,PP*).","In order to effectively differentiate the candidates like the above, we propose the Root directed Subset Tree (RdSST) by encapsulating each SST with the root of the given sub-tree. As shown in Fig 2, a sub-structure is considered identical to the given examples, when the SST is identical and the root tag of the given sub-tree is NP. As a result, the kernel function in Section 2.1 is re-defined as:","",",","∑∑∆,",","," ","","",", ∑∑∆,"," ",""," ","where and","are the root nodes of the sub-tree and","respectively.

Although defined for individual SST, the indicator function can be evaluated outside the summation, without increasing the computational complexity of the kernel function. 3.3 Root generated Subset Tree Some grammatical tags (NP/VP) may have identical tags as their parents or children which may make RdSST less effective. Consequently, we step further to propose the sub-structure of Root generated Subset Tree (RgSST). An RgSST requires the root node of the given sub-tree to be part of the sub-structure. In other words, all sub-structures should be generated from the root of the given sub-tree as presented in Fig. 2. Therefore the kernel function can be simplified to only capture the sub-structure rooted at the root of the sub-tree.

The lexical features with directions are defined as conditional feature functions based on the conditional lexical translation probabilities. The plain syntactic structural features can deal with the structural divergence of bilingual parse trees in a more general perspective. 4.1 Lexical and Word Alignment Features In this section, we define seven lexical features to measure semantic similarity of a given sub-tree pair.","Internal Lexical Features: We define two lexical features with respective to the internal span of the sub-tree pair. | ∏∑|  ||","   ","Figure 2: Illustration of SST, RdSST and RgSST 309 | ∏∑|  ||"," ","where | refers to the lexical translation probability from the source word to the target word within the sub-tree spans, while | refers to that from target to source; refers to the word set for the internal span of the source sub-tree , while refers to that of the target sub-tree .","Internal-External Lexical Features: These features are motivated by the fact that lexical translation probabilities within the translational equivalence tend to be high, and that of the non-equivalent counterparts tend to be low. | ∏∑ |  ||"," | ∏∑ |  ||"," ","where refers to the word set for the external span of the source sub-tree , while refers to that of the target sub-tree .","Internal Word Alignment Features: The word alignment links account much for the cooccurrence of the aligned terms.

The first is HIT gold standard English Chinese parallel tree bank referred as HIT corpus1",". The other is the automatically parsed bilingual tree pairs selected from FBIS corpus (al-lowing minor parsing errors) with human annotated sub-tree alignment. 6.1 Data preparation HIT corpus, which is collected from English learning text books in China as well as example sentences in dictionaries, is used for the gold standard corpus evaluation. The word segmentation, tokenization and parse-tree in the corpus are manually constructed or checked. The corpus is constructed with manually annotated sub-tree alignment. The annotation strictly reserves the semantic equivalence of the aligned sub-tree pair. Only sure links are conducted in the internal node level, without considering possible links adopted in word alignment. A different annotation criterion of the Chinese parse tree, designed by the annotator, is employed. Compared with the widely used Penn TreeBank annotation, the new criterion utilizes some different grammar tags and is able to effectively describe some rare language phenomena in Chinese. The annotator still uses Penn TreeBank annotation on the English side. The statistics of HIT corpus used in our experiment is shown in Table 1. We use 5000 sentences for experiment and divide them into three parts, with 3k for training, 1k for testing and 1k for tuning the parameters of kernels and thresholds of pruning the negative instances. 1 HIT corpus is designed and constructed by HIT-MITLAB. http://mitlab.hit.edu.cn/index.php/resources.html .","Most linguistically motivated syntax based SMT systems require an automatic parser to per-form the rule induction. Thus, it is important to evaluate the sub-tree alignment on the automatically parsed corpus with parsing errors. In addition, HIT corpus is not applicable for MT experiment due to the problems of domain divergence, annotation discrepancy (Chinese parse tree employs a different grammar from Penn Treebank annotations) and degree of tolerance for parsing errors.","Due to the above issues, we annotate a new data set to apply the sub-tree alignment in machine translation. We randomly select 300 bilingual sentence pairs from the Chinese-English FBIS corpus with the length 30 in both the source and target sides. The selected plain sentence pairs are further parsed by Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) on both the English and Chinese sides. We manually annotate the sub-tree alignment for the automatically parsed tree pairs according to the definition in Section 1. To be fully consistent with the definition, we strictly reserve the semantic equivalence for the aligned sub-trees to keep a high precision. In other words, we do not conduct any doubtful links. The corpus is further divided into 200 aligned tree pairs for training and 100 for testing as shown in Table 2. 6.2 Baseline approach We implement the work in Tinsley et al. (2007) as our baseline methodology.","Given a tree pair , , the baseline approach first takes all the links between the sub-tree pairs as alignment hypotheses, i.e., the Cartesian product of the two sub-tree sets:",",...,,..., ,...,,...,","By using the lexical translation probabilities, each hypothesis is assigned an alignment score.

Heuristic skip1 skips the tied hypotheses with the same score, until it finds the highest-scoring hypothesis with no competitors of the same score. Heuristic skip2 deals with the same problem. Initially, it skips over the tied hypotheses. When a hypothesis sub-tree pair , without any competitor of the same score is found, where neither nor has been skipped over, the hypothesis is chosen as a sure link. Heuristic span1 postpones the selection of the hypotheses on the POS level. Since the highest-scoring hypotheses tend to appear on the leaf nodes, it may introduce ambiguity when conducting the alignment for a POS node whose child word appears twice in a sentence.","The baseline method proposes two score functions based on the lexical translation probability. They also compute the score function by splitting the tree into the internal and external components.","Tinsley et al. (2007) adopt the lexical translation probabilities dumped by GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to compute the span based scores for each pair of sub-trees.

(2007), skip2_s1_span1 denotes the utilization of heuristics skip2 and span1 while using score function 1 6.3 Experimental settings We use SVM with binary classes as the classifier. In case of the implementation, we modify the Tree Kernel tool (Moschitti, 2004) and SVMLight (Joachims, 1999). The coefficient for the composite kernel are tuned with respect to F-measure (F) on the development set of HIT corpus. We empirically set C=2.4 for SVM and use 0.23, the default parameter 0.4 for BTKs.","Since the negative training instances largely overwhelm the positive instances, we prune the negative instances using the thresholds according to the lexical feature functions (,,,) and online structural feature functions ( ,, ). Those thresholds are also tuned on the development set of HIT corpus with respect to F-measure.","To learn the lexical and word alignment features for both the proposed model and the baseline method, we train GIZA++ on the entire FBIS bilingual corpus (240k).

In detail, the iBTKs and dBTKs are firstly combined with the polynomial kernel for plain features individually, then the best iBTK and dBTK are chosen to construct a more complex composite kernel along with the polynomial kernel for both corpora.

The improvement suggests that the proposed framework with syntactic structural features is more effective in modeling the bilingual syntactic correspondence.","• By introducing BTKs to construct a composite kernel, the performance in both corpora is significantly improved against only using the polynomial kernel for plain features. This suggests that the structural features captured by BTKs are quite useful for the sub-tree alignment task. We also try to use BTKs alone without the polynomial kernel for plain features; however, the performance is rather low. This suggests that the structure correspondence cannot be used to measure the semantically equivalent tree structures alone, since the same syntactic structure tends to be reused in the same parse tree and lose the ability of disambiguation to some extent. In other words, to capture the semantic similarity, structure features requires lexical features to cooperate.","• After comparing iBTKs with the corresponding dBTKs, we find that for FBIS corpus, iBTK greatly outperforms dBTK in any feature space except the Root space. However, when it comes the HIT corpus, the gaps between the corresponding iBTKs and dBTKs are much closer, while on the Root space, dBTK outperforms iBTK to a large amount. This finding can be explained by the relationship between the amount of training data and the high dimensional feature space. Since dBTKs are constructed in a joint manner which obtains a much larger high dimensional feature space than those of iBTKs, dBTKs require more training data to excel its capability, otherwise it will suffer from the data sparseness problem. The reason that dBTK outperforms iBTK in the feature space of Root in FBIS corpus is that although it is a joint feature space, the Root node pairs can be constructed from a close set of grammar tags and to form a relatively low dimensional space. As a result, when applying to FBIS corpus, which only contains limited amount of training data, dBTKs will suffer more from the data sparseness problem, and therefore, a relatively low performance. When enlarging the amount of training corpus to the HIT corpus, the ability of dBTKs excels and the benefit from data increasing of dBTKs is more significant than iBTKs.","• We also find that the introduction of BTKs gains more improvement in HIT gold standard corpus than in FBIS corpus. Other than the factor of the amount of training data, this is also because the plain features in Table 3 are not as effective as those in Table 4, since they are trained on FBIS corpus which facilitates Table 4 more with respect to the domains. On the other hand, the grammatical tags and syntactic tree structures are more accurate in HIT corpus, which facilitates the performance of BTKs in Table 3.","• On the comparison across the different feature spaces of BTKs, we find that STT, RdSTT and TgSTT are rather selective, since Recalls of those feature spaces are relatively low, exp. for HIT corpus. However, the Root sub-structure obtains a satisfactory Recall for both corpora. That’s why we attempt to construct a more complex composite kernel in adoption of the kernel of dBTK-Root as below.","• To gain an extra performance boosting, we further construct a composite kernel which includes the best iBTK and the best dBTK for each corpus along with the polynomial kernel for plain features. In the HIT corpus, we use dBTK in the Root space and iBTK in the RgSST space; while for FBIS corpus, we use dBTK in the Root space and iBTK in the RdSST space. The experimental results suggest that by combining iBTK and dBTK together, we can achieve more improvement."]},{"title":"7 Experiments on Machine Translation","paragraphs":["In addition to the intrinsic alignment evaluation, we further conduct the extrinsic MT evaluation. We explore the effectiveness of sub-tree alignment for both phrase based and linguistically motivated syntax based SMT systems. 7.1 Experimental configuration In the experiments, we train the translation model on FBIS corpus (7.2M (Chinese) + 9.2M (English) words in 240,000 sentence pairs) and train a 4-gram language model on the Xinhua portion of the English Gigaword corpus (181M words) using the SRILM Toolkits (Stolcke, 2002). We use these sentences with less than 50 characters from the NIST MT-2002 test set as the development set (to speed up tuning for syntax based system) and the NIST MT-2005 test set as our test set. We use the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) to parse bilingual sentences on the training set and Chinese sentences on the development and test set. The evaluation metric is case-sensitive BLEU-4. 313","For the phrase based system, we use Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) with its default settings. For the syntax based system, since sub-tree alignment can directly benefit Tree-2-Tree based systems, we apply the sub-tree alignment in a syntax system based on Synchronous Tree Substitution Grammar (STSG) (Zhang et al., 2007). The STSG based decoder uses a pair of elementary tree3","as a basic translation unit. Recent research on tree based systems shows that relaxing the restriction from tree structure to tree sequence structure (Synchronous Tree Sequence Substitution Grammar: STSSG) significantly improves the translation performance (Zhang et al., 2008). We implement the STSG/STSSG based model in the Pisces decoder with the identical features and settings in Sun et al. (2009). In the Pisces decoder, the STSSG based decoder translates each span iteratively in a bottom up manner which guarantees that when translating a source span, any of its subspans is already translated. The STSG based decoding can be easily performed with the STSSG decoder by restricting the translation rule set to be elementary tree pairs only.","As for the alignment setting, we use the word alignment trained on the entire FBIS (240k) corpus by GIZA++ with heuristic grow-diag-final for both Moses and the syntax system. For sub-tree-alignment, we use the above word alignment to learn lexical/word alignment feature, and train with the FBIS training corpus (200) using the composite kernel of Plain+dBTK-Root+iBTK-RdSTT. 7.2 Experimental results Compared with the adoption of word alignment, translational equivalences generated from structural alignment tend to be more grammatically 3 An elementary tree is a fragment whose leaf nodes can be either non-terminal symbols or terminal symbols. aware and syntactically meaningful. However, utilizing syntactic translational equivalences alone for machine translation loses the capability of modeling non-syntactic phrases (Koehn et al., 2003). Consequently, instead of using phrases constraint by sub-tree alignment alone, we attempt to combine word alignment and sub-tree alignment and deploy the capability of both with two methods.","• Directly Concatenate (DirC) is operated by directly concatenating the rule set genereted from sub-tree alignment and the original rule set generated from word alignment (Tinsley et al., 2009). As shown in Table 5, we gain minor improvement in the Bleu score for all configurations.","• Alternatively, we proposed a new approach to generate the rule set from the scratch. We constrain the bilingual phrases to be consistent with Either Word alignment or Sub-tree alignment (EWoS) instead of being originally consistent with the word alignment only. The method helps tailoring the rule set decently without redundant counts for syntactic rules. The performance is further improved compared to DirC in all systems.","The findings suggest that with the modeling of non-syntactic phrases maintained, more emphasis on syntactic phrases can benefit both the phrase and syntax based SMT systems."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we explore syntactic structure features by means of Bilingual Tree Kernels and apply them to bilingual sub-tree alignment along with various lexical and plain structural features. We use both gold standard tree bank and the automatically parsed corpus for the sub-tree alignment evaluation. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms the baseline method and the proposed Bilingual Tree Kernels are very effective in capturing the cross-lingual structural similarity. Further experiment shows that the obtained sub-tree alignment benefits both phrase and syntax based MT systems by deliver-ing more weight on syntactic phrases."," Acknowledgments We thank MITLAB4","in Harbin Institute of Technology for licensing us their sub-tree alignment corpus for our research. 4 http://mitlab.hit.edu.cn/ .","System Model BLEU Moses BP* 23.86 DirC 23.98","EWoS 24.48 Syntax STSG","STSG 24.71","DirC 25.16 EWoS 25.38","Syntax STSSG 25.92","STSSG DirC 25.95 EWoS 26.45","","Table 5.
