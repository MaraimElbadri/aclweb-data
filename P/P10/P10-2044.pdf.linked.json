Whittaker and Sadaoki Furui Department of Computer Science Tokyo Institute of Technology Tokyo 152-8552, Japan {heie,edw,furui}@furui.cs.titech.ac.jp Abstract","paragraphs":["In this paper we demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between the Question Answering (QA) accuracy and the log-likelihood of the answer typing component of our statistical QA model. We exploit this observation in a clustering algorithm which optimizes QA accuracy by maximizing the log-likelihood of a set of question-and-answer pairs. Experimental results show that we achieve better QA accuracy using the resulting clusters than by using manually derived clusters."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Question Answering (QA) distinguishes itself from other information retrieval tasks in that the system tries to return accurate answers to queries posed in natural language. Factoid QA limits itself to questions that can usually be answered with a few words. Typically factoid QA systems employ some form of question type analysis, so that a question such as What is the capital of Japan? will be answered with a geographical term. While many QA systems use hand-crafted rules for this task, such an approach is time-consuming and doesn’t generalize well to other languages. Machine learning methods have been proposed, such as question classification using support vector machines (Zhang and Lee, 2003) and language modeling (Merkel and Klakow, 2007). In these approaches, question categories are predefined and a classifier is trained on manually labeled data. This is an example of supervised learning. In this paper we present an unsupervised method, where we attempt to cluster question-and-answer (q-a) pairs without any predefined question categories, hence no manually class-labeled questions are used.","We use a statistical QA framework, described in Section 2, where the system is trained with clusters of q-a pairs. This framework was used in several TREC evaluations where it placed in the top 10 of participating systems (Whittaker et al., 2006). In Section 3 we show that answer accuracy is strongly correlated with the log-likelihood of the q-a pairs computed by this statistical model. In Section 4 we propose an algorithm to cluster q-a pairs by maximizing the log-likelihood of a disjoint set of q-a pairs. In Section 5 we evaluate the QA accuracy by training the QA system with the resulting clusters."]},{"title":"2 QA system","paragraphs":["In our QA framework we choose to model only the probability of an answer A given a question Q, and assume that the answer A depends on two sets of features: W = W (Q) and X = X(Q): P (A|Q) = P (A|W, X), (1) where W represents a set of |W | features describ-ing the question-type part of Q such as who, when, where, which, etc., and X is a set of features which describes the “information-bearing” part of Q, i.e. what the question is actually about and what it refers to. For example, in the questions Where is Mount Fuji? and How high is Mount Fuji?, the question type features W differ, while the information-bearing features X are identical. Finding the best answer Â involves a search over all A for the one which maximizes the probability of the above model, i.e.:","Â = arg max A P (A|W, X). (2)","Given the correct probability distribution, this will give us the optimal answer in a maximum likelihood sense. Using Bayes’ rule, assuming uniform P (A) and that W and X are independent of each other given A, in addition to ignoring P (W, X) since it is independent of A, enables us to rewrite Eq. (2) as 236","Â = arg max A P (A | X) } {{ } retrieval","model","· P (W | A) } {{ } filter model . (3) 2.1 Retrieval Model The retrieval model P (A|X) is essentially a language model which models the probability of an answer sequence A given a set of information-bearing features X = {x1, . . . , x|X|}. This set is constructed by extracting single-word features from Q that are not present in a stop-list of highfrequency words. The implementation of the retrieval model used for the experiments described in this paper, models the proximity of A to features in X. It is not examined further here; see (Whittaker et al., 2005) for more details. 2.2 Filter Model The question-type feature set W = {w1, . . . , w|W |} is constructed by extracting n-tuples (n = 1, 2, . . .) such as where, in what and when were from the input question Q. We limit ourselves to extracting single-word features. The 2522 most frequent words in a collection of example questions are considered in-vocabulary words; all other words are out-of-vocabulary words, and substituted with ⟨UNK⟩.","Modeling the complex relationship between W and A directly is non-trivial. We therefore introduce an intermediate variable CE = {c1, . . . , c|CE|}, representing a set of classes of example q-a pairs. In order to construct these classes, given a set E = {t1, . . . , t|E|} of example q-a pairs, we define a mapping function f : E ↦→ CE which maps each example q-a pair tj for j = 1 . . . |E| into a particular class f (tj) = ce. Thus each class ce may be defined as the union of all component q-a features from each tj satisfy-ing f (tj) = ce. Hence each class ce constitutes a cluster of q-a pairs. Finally, to facilitate modeling we say that W is conditionally independent of A given ce so that, P (W | A) = |CE| ∑ e=1","P (W | ce W ) · P (ce","A | A), (4) where ce","W and ce","A refer to the subsets of question-type features and example answers for the class ce, respectively.","P (W | ce","W ) is implemented as trigram language models with backoff smoothing using absolute discounting (Huang et al., 2001).","Due to data sparsity, our set of example q-a pairs cannot be expected to cover all the possible answers to questions that may ever be asked. We therefore employ answer class modeling rather than answer word modeling by expanding Eq. (4) as follows: P (W | A) = |CE| ∑ e=1","P (W | ce W )· |KA| ∑ a=1","P (ce A | ka)P (ka | A), (5) where ka is a concrete class in the set of |KA| answer classes KA. These classes are generated using the Kneser-Ney clustering algorithm, commonly used for generating class definitions for class language models (Kneser and Ney, 1993).","In this paper we restrict ourselves to single-word answers; see (Whittaker et al., 2005) for the modeling of multi-word answers. We estimate P (ce","A | kA) as","P (ce A | kA) =","f (kA, ce A) |CE| ∑ g=1","f (kA, cg A) , (6) where","f (kA, ce A) = ∑","∀i:i∈ce","A δ(i ∈ kA) |ce A| , (7) and δ(·) is a discrete indicator function which equals 1 if its argument evaluates true and 0 if false.","P (ka | A) is estimated as P (ka | A) = 1 ∑ ∀j:j∈Ka δ(A ∈ j) .

We find that LL and M RR are strongly correlated, with a correlation coefficient ρ = 0.86.","This observation indicates that we should be able to improve the answer accuracy of the QA system by optimizing the LL of the filter model in isolation, similar to how, in automatic speech recognition, the LL of the language model can be optimized in isolation to improve the speech recognition accuracy (Huang et al., 2001)."]},{"title":"4 Clustering algorithm","paragraphs":["Using the observation that LL is correlated with M RR on the same data set, we expect that optimizing LL on a development set (LLdev) will also improve M RR on an evaluation set (M RReval).

Furthermore, we only use q-a pairs which can be answered with a single word. As training data we use questions and answers from the Knowledge-Master collection1",". Development/evaluation questions are the questions from TREC QA evaluations from TREC 2002 to TREC 2006, the answers to which are to be retrieved from the AQUAINT corpus. In total we have 2016 q-a pairs for training and 568 questions for development/evaluation. We are able to retrieve the correct answer for 317 of the development/evaluation questions, thus the theoretical upper bound for our experiments is an answer accuracy of M RR = 0.558.","Accuracy is evaluated using 5-fold (rotating) cross-validation, where in each fold the TREC QA data is partitioned into a development set of 1 http://www.greatauk.com/ 238","Configuration LLeval M RReval #clusters manual -1.18 0.262 3 all-in-one -1.32 0.183 1 one-in-each -0.87 0.263 2016 automatic -0.24 0.281 4 Table 1: LLeval (average per q-a pair) and M RReval (over all held-out TREC years), and number of clusters (median of the cross-evaluation folds) for the various configurations. 4 years’ data and an evaluation set of one year’s data. For each TREC question the top 50 documents from the AQUAINT corpus are retrieved using Lucene2",". We use the QA system described in Section 2 for QA evaluation. Our evaluation metric is M RReval, and LLdev is our optimization criterion, as motivated in Section 3.","Our baseline system uses manual clusters. These clusters are obtained by putting all who q-a pairs in one cluster, all when pairs in a second and all where pairs in a third. We compare this baseline with using clusters resulting from the algorithm described in Section 4. We run this algorithm until there are no further improvements in LLdev. Two other cluster configurations are also investigated: all q-a pairs in one cluster (all-in-one), and each q-a pair in its own cluster (one-in-each). The all-in-one configuration is equivalent to not using the filter model, i.e. answer candidates are ranked solely by the retrieval model. The one-in-each configuration was shown to perform well in the TREC 2006 QA evaluation (Whittaker et al., 2006), where it ranked 9th among 27 participants on the factoid QA task. 5.2 Results In Table 1, we see that the manual clusters (baseline) achieves an M RReval of 0.262, while the clusters resulting from the clustering algorithm give an M RReval of 0.281, which is a relative improvement of 7%. This improvement is statistically significant at the 0.01 level using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The one-in-each cluster configuration achieves an M RReval of 0.263, which is not a statistically significant improvement over the baseline. The all-in-one cluster configuration (i.e. no filter model) has the lowest accuracy, with an M RReval of 0.183. 2 http://lucene.apache.org/ -1.4 -1.2 -1 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0 0 400 800 1200 1600 2000 0.16 0.18 0.2 0.22 0.24 0.26 0.28 0.3 0.32","LL MRR # iterations LL dev","MRR dev (a) Development set, 4 year’s TREC. -1.4 -1.2 -1 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0 0 400 800 1200 1600 2000 0.16 0.18 0.2 0.22 0.24 0.26 0.28 0.3 0.32","LL MRR # iterations LL eval","MRR eval (b) Evaluation set, 1 year’s TREC.

However, in some cases both who and where q-a pairs occurred in the same cluster, so as to better answer questions like Who won the World Cup?, where the answer could be a country name.","As can be seen from Table 1, there are only 4 clusters in the automatic configuration, compared to 2016 in the one-in-each configuration. Since the computational complexity of the filter model described in Section 2.2 is linear in the number of clusters, a beneficial side effect of our clustering procedure is a significant reduction in the computational requirement of the filter model.","In Figure 2 we plot LL and M RR for one of the cross-validation folds over multiple iterations (the while loop) of the clustering algorithm in Sec-239 tion 4. It can clearly be seen that the optimization of LLdev leads to improvement in M RReval, and that LLeval is also well correlated with M RReval."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper we have shown that the log-likelihood of our statistical model is strongly correlated with answer accuracy. Using this information, we have clustered training q-a pairs by maximizing log-likelihood on a disjoint development set of q-a pairs. The experiments show that with these clusters we achieve better QA accuracy than using manually clustered training q-a pairs.","In future work we will extend the types of questions that we consider, and also allow for multi-word answers."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The authors wish to thank Dietrich Klakow for his discussion at the concept stage of this work.
