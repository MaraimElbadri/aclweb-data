We give a detailed description of algorithms for application of cascades of weighted tree transducers to weighted tree acceptors, connecting formal theory with actual practice. Additionally, we present novel on-the-fly variants of these algorithms, and compare their performance on a syntax machine translation cascade based on (Yamada and Knight, 2001). 1 Motivation Weighted finite-state transducers have found recent favor as models of natural language (Mohri, 1997). In order to make actual use of systems built with these formalisms we must first calculate the set of possible weighted outputs allowed by the transducer given some input, which we call forward application, or the set of possible weighted inputs given some output, which we call backward application. After application we can do some inference on this result, such as determining its k highest weighted elements.","We may also want to divide up our problems into manageable chunks, each represented by a transducer. As noted by Woods (1980), it is easier for designers to write several small transducers where each performs a simple transformation, rather than painstakingly construct a single complicated device. We would like to know, then, the result of transformation of input or output by a cascade of transducers, one operating after the other. As we will see, there are various strategies for approaching this problem. We will consider offline composition, bucket brigade application, and on-the-fly application.","Application of cascades of weighted string transducers (WSTs) has been well-studied (Mohri, 1997). Less well-studied but of more recent in-terest is application of cascades of weighted tree transducers (WTTs). We tackle application of WTT cascades in this work, presenting: • explicit algorithms for application of WTT cascades • novel algorithms for on-the-fly application of WTT cascades, and • experiments comparing the performance of these algorithms. 2 Strategies for the string case Before we discuss application of WTTs, it is helpful to recall the solution to this problem in the WST domain. We recall previous formal presentations of WSTs (Mohri, 1997) and note informally that they may be represented as directed graphs with designated start and end states and edges labeled with input symbols, output symbols, and weights.1 Fortunately, the solution for WSTs is practically trivial—we achieve application through a series of embedding, composition, and projection operations. Embedding is simply the act of representing a string or regular string language as an identity WST. Composition of WSTs, that is, generat-ing a single WST that captures the transformations of two input WSTs used in sequence, is not at all trivial, but has been well covered in, e.g., (Mohri, 2009), where directly implementable algorithms can be found. Finally, projection is another trivial operation—the domain or range language can be obtained from a WST by ignoring the output or input symbols, respectively, on its arcs, and sum-ming weights on otherwise identical arcs. By embedding an input, composing the result with the given WST, and projecting the result, forward application is accomplished.2","We are then left with a weighted string acceptor (WSA), essentially a weighted, labeled graph, which can be traversed","1","We assume throughout this paper that weights are in R+ ∪ {+∞}, that the weight of a path is calculated as the product of the weights of its edges, and that the weight of a (not necessarily finite) set T of paths is calculated as the sum of the weights of the paths of T .","2","For backward applications, the roles of input and output are simply exchanged. 1058"," ","","","","","","","","","","  (a) Input string “a a” embedded in an identity WST ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""," ","","","","","","","     ","     ","     ","      (b) first WST in cascade","    ","","    "," ","    ","","    "," (c) second WST in cascade  ","     ","","     ","","     ","","     ","  ","     ","","     ","","     ","","     ","","     ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","     "," (d) Offline composition approach: Compose the transducers  ","","","","","","","   ","","","        (e) Bucket brigade approach: Apply WST (b) to WST (a)   ","","","","","","          ","","","","","   ","                                                (f) Result of offline or bucket application after projection     ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","                          (g) Initial on-the-fly stand-in for (f)     ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","                          (h) On-the-fly stand-in after exploring outgoing edges of state ADF     ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","                          (i) On-the-fly stand-in after best path has been found Figure 1: Three different approaches to application through cascades of WSTs. by well-known algorithms to efficiently find the k-best paths.","Because WSTs can be freely composed, extend-ing application to operate on a cascade of WSTs is fairly trivial. The only question is one of composition order: whether to initially compose the cascade into a single transducer (an approach we call offline composition) or to compose the initial embedding with the first transducer, trim useless states, compose the result with the second, and so on (an approach we call bucket brigade). The appropriate strategy generally depends on the structure of the individual transducers.","A third approach builds the result incrementally, as dictated by some algorithm that requests information about it. Such an approach, which we call on-the-fly, was described in (Pereira and Riley, 1997; Mohri, 2009; Mohri et al., 2000). If we can efficiently calculate the outgoing edges of a state of the result WSA on demand, without calculating all edges in the entire machine, we can maintain a stand-in for the result structure, a machine consisting at first of only the start state of the true result. As a calling algorithm (e.g., an implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm) requests information about the result graph, such as the set of outgoing edges from a state, we replace the current stand-in with a richer version by adding the result of the request. The on-the-fly approach has a distinct advantage over the other two methods in that the entire result graph need not be built. A graphical representation of all three methods is presented in Figure 1. 3 Application of tree transducers Now let us revisit these strategies in the setting of trees and tree transducers. Imagine we have a tree or set of trees as input that can be represented as a weighted regular tree grammar3","(WRTG) and a WTT that can transform that input with some weight. We would like to know the k-best trees the WTT can produce as output for that input, along with their weights. We already know of several methods for acquiring k-best trees from a WRTG (Huang and Chiang, 2005; Pauls and Klein, 2009), so we then must ask if, analogously to the string case, WTTs preserve recognizability4","and we can form an application WRTG. Before we begin, however, we must define WTTs and WRTGs. 3.1 Preliminaries5 A ranked alphabet is a finite set Σ such that every member σ ∈ Σ has a rank rk(σ) ∈ N. We call Σ(k)","⊆ Σ, k ∈ N the set of those σ ∈ Σ such that rk(σ) = k. The set of variables is denoted X = {x1, x2, . . .} and is assumed to be disjoint from any ranked alphabet used in this paper. We use ⊥ to denote a symbol of rank 0 that is not in any ranked alphabet used in this paper. A tree t ∈ TΣ is denoted σ(t1, . . . , tk) where k ≥ 0, σ ∈ Σ(k)",", and t","1, . . . , tk ∈ TΣ.

For every set S disjoint from Σ, let TΣ(S) = TΣ∪S, where, for all s ∈ S, rk(s) = 0.","We define the positions of a tree t = σ(t1, . . . , tk), for k ≥ 0, σ ∈ Σ(k)",", t1, . . . , tk ∈ TΣ, as a set pos(t) ⊂ N∗","such that pos(t) = {ε} ∪ {iv | 1 ≤ i ≤ k, v ∈ pos(ti)}. The set of leaf positions lv(t) ⊆ pos(t) are those positions v ∈ pos(t) such that for no i ∈ N, vi ∈ pos(t). We presume standard lexicographic orderings < and ≤ on pos.","Let t, s ∈ TΣ and v ∈ pos(t). The label of t at position v, denoted by t(v), the subtree of t at v, denoted by t|v, and the replacement at v by s, denoted by t[s]v, are defined as follows: 1. For every σ ∈ Σ(0)",", σ(ε) = σ, σ|ε = σ, and σ[s]ε = s.","2. For every t = σ(t1, . . . , tk) such that k = rk(σ) and k ≥ 1, t(ε) = σ, t|ε = t, and t[s]ε = s.

The size of a tree t, size (t) is |pos(t)|, the car-","dinality of its position set. The yield set of a tree","is the set of labels of its leaves: for a tree t, yd (t)","= {t(v) | v ∈ lv(t)}.

(Alexandrakis and Bozapa-","lidis, 1987)) A weighted regular tree grammar","(WRTG) is a 4-tuple G = (N, Σ, P, n0) where:","1.

The weighted tree language recognized by G is the mapping LG : TΣ → R∞","+ such that for every t ∈ TΣ, LG(t) is the sum of the weights of all (possibly infinitely many) derivations of t in G. A weighted tree language f : TΣ → R∞","+ is recognizable if there is a WRTG G such that f = LG.","We define a partial ordering ⪯ on WRTGs such that for WRTGs G1 = (N1, Σ, P1, n0) and G2 = (N2, Σ, P2, n0), we say G1 ⪯ G2 iff N1 ⊆ N2 and P1 ⊆ P2, where the weights are preserved. Definition 3.2 (cf. Def. 1 of (Maletti, 2008)) A weighted extended top-down tree transducer (WXTT) is a 5-tuple M = (Q, Σ, ∆, R, q0) where:","1. Q is a finite set of states.","2. Σ and ∆ are the ranked alphabets of input and output symbols, respectively, where (Σ ∪ ∆) ∩ Q = ∅.","3. R is a tuple (R′",", π), where R′","is a finite set of rules, each rule r of the form q.y −→ u for q ∈ Q, y ∈ TΣ(X), and u ∈ T∆(Q × X). We further require that no variable x ∈ X appears more than once in y, and that each variable appearing in u is also in y. Moreover, π : R′","→ R∞","+ is a weight function of the rules. As for WRTGs, we refer to R as a finite set of weighted rules, each rule r of the form q.y π(r) −−→ u.","A WXTT is linear (respectively, nondeleting) if, for each rule r of the form q.y","w","−→ u, each x ∈ yd (y) ∩ X appears at most once (respectively, at least once) in u. We denote the class of all WXTTs as wxT and add the letters L and N to signify the subclasses of linear and nondeleting WTT, respectively. Additionally, if y is of the form σ(x1, . . . , xk), we remove the letter “x” to signify 1060 the transducer is not extended (i.e., it is a “traditional” WTT (Fülöp and Vogler, 2009)).","For WXTT M = (Q, Σ, ∆, R, q0), s, t ∈ T∆(Q × TΣ), and r ∈ R of the form q.y","w","−→ u, we obtain a derivation step from s to t by replacing some leaf of s labeled with q and a tree matching y by a transformation of u, where each instance of a variable has been replaced by a corresponding subtree of the y-matching tree. Formally, s ⇒r","M t if there is a position v ∈ pos(s), a substitution mapping φ : X → TΣ, and a rule q.y","w","−→ u ∈ R such that","s(v) = (q, φ(y)) and t = s[φ′","(u)]v, where φ′","is","a substitution mapping Q × X → T∆(Q × TΣ)","defined such that φ′","(q′",", x) = (q′",", φ(x)) for all","q′ ∈ Q and x ∈ X. We say this derivation step","is leftmost if, for all v′","∈ lv(s) where v′","< v,","s(v′ ) ∈ ∆. We henceforth assume all derivation","steps are leftmost.

The weighted tree transformation recognized by M is the mapping τM : TΣ × T∆ → R∞","+ , such that for every s ∈ TΣ and t ∈ T∆, τM (s, t) is the sum of the weights of all (possibly infinitely many) derivations of (s, t) in M . The composition of two weighted tree transformations τ : TΣ × T∆ → R∞","+ and μ : T∆ × TΓ → R∞","+ is the weighted tree transformation (τ ; μ) : TΣ × TΓ → R∞","+ where for every s ∈ TΣ and u ∈ TΓ, (τ ; μ)(s, u) =","∑ t∈T∆ τ (s, t) · μ(t, u). 3.2 Applicable classes We now consider transducer classes where recognizability is preserved under application. Table 1 presents known results for the top-down tree transducer classes described in Section 3.1. Unlike the string case, preservation of recognizability is not universal or symmetric. This is important for us, because we can only construct an application WRTG, i.e., a WRTG representing the result of application, if we can ensure that the language generated by application is in fact recognizable. Of the types under consideration, only wxLNT and wLNT preserve forward recognizability. The two classes marked as open questions and the other classes, which are superclasses of wNT, do not or are presumed not to. All subclasses of wxLT preserve backward recognizability.7","We do not consider cases where recognizability is not preserved in the remainder of this paper. If a transducer M of a class that preserves forward recognizability is applied to a WRTG G, we can call the forward ap-7","Note that the introduction of weights limits recognizability preservation considerably. For example, (unweighted) xT preserves backward recognizability. plication WRTG M (G)▷","and if M preserves backward recognizability, we can call the backward application WRTG M (G)◁",".","Now that we have explained the application problem in the context of weighted tree transducers and determined the classes for which application is possible, let us consider how to build forward and backward application WRTGs. Our basic approach mimics that taken for WSTs by using an embed-compose-project strategy. As in string world, if we can embed the input in a transducer, compose with the given transducer, and project the result, we can obtain the application WRTG. Embedding a WRTG in a wLNT is a trivial operation—if the WRTG is in normal form and chain production-free, 8","for every production of the form n w −→ σ(n1, . . . , nk), create a rule of the form","n.σ(x1, . . . , xk)","w","−→ σ(n1.x1, . . . , nk.xk). Range projection of a wxLNT is also trivial—for every q ∈ Q and u ∈ T∆(Q × X) create a production of the form q","w","−→ u′","where u′","is formed from u by replacing all leaves of the form q.x with the leaf q, i.e., removing references to variables, and w is the sum of the weights of all rules of the form q.y −→ u in R.9","Domain projection for wxLT is best explained by way of example. The left side of a rule is preserved, with variables leaves replaced by their associated states from the right side. So, the rule q1.σ(γ(x1), x2) w −→ δ(q2.x2, β(α, q3.x1))","would yield the production q1","w","−→ σ(γ(q3), q2) in","the domain projection. However, a deleting rule","such as q1.σ(x1, x2)","w","−→ γ(q2.x2) necessitates the introduction of a new nonterminal ⊥ that can generate all of TΣ with weight 1.","The only missing piece in our embed-compose-project strategy is composition. Algorithm 1, which is based on the declarative construction of Maletti (2006), generates the syntactic composition of a wxLT and a wLNT, a generalization of the basic composition construction of Baker (1979). It calls Algorithm 2, which determines the sequences of rules in the second transducer that match the right side of a single rule in the first transducer. Since the embedded WRTG is of type wLNT, it may be either the first or second argument provided to Algorithm 1, depending on whether the application is forward or backward. We can thus use the embed-compose-project strategy for forward application of wLNT and backward application of wxLT and wxLNT. Note that we cannot use this strategy for forward applica-8 Without loss of generality we assume this is so, since","standard algorithms exist to remove chain productions","(Kuich, 1998; Ésik and Kuich, 2003; Mohri, 2009) and con-","vert into normal form (Alexandrakis and Bozapalidis, 1987). 9 Finitely many such productions may be formed. 1061 tion of wxLNT, even though that class preserves recognizability.","Algorithm 1 COMPOSE","1: inputs","2: wxLT M1 = (Q1, Σ, ∆, R1, q1","0)","3: wLNT M2 = (Q2, ∆, Γ, R2, q2","0)","4: outputs","5: wxLT M3 = ((Q1 × Q2), Σ, Γ, R3, (q1","0, q2","0)) such that M3 = (τM","1; τM","2).","6: complexity","7: O(|R1| max(|R2|size(ũ)",", |Q2|)), where ũ is the largest right side tree in any rule in R1","8: Let R3 be of the form (R′ 3, π) 9: R3 ← (∅, ∅) 10: Ξ ← {(q1","0, q2","0)} {seen states} 11: Ψ ← {(q1","0, q2","0)} {pending states} 12: while Ψ ̸= ∅ do 13: (q1, q2) ←any element of Ψ 14: Ψ ← Ψ \\ {(q1, q2)} 15: for all (q1.y","w","1","−−→ u) ∈ R1 do 16: for all (z, w2) ∈ COVER(u, M2, q2) do 17: for all (q, x) ∈ yd (z) ∩ ((Q1 × Q2) × X) do 18: if q ̸∈ Ξ then 19: Ξ ← Ξ ∪ {q} 20: Ψ ← Ψ ∪ {q} 21: r ← ((q1, q2).y −→ z) 22: R′","3 ← R′","3 ∪ {r} 23: π(r) ← π(r) + (w1 · w2) 24: return M3 4 Application of tree transducer cascades What about the case of an input WRTG and a cascade of tree transducers? We will revisit the three strategies for accomplishing application discussed above for the string case.","In order for offline composition to be a viable strategy, the transducers in the cascade must be closed under composition. Unfortunately, of the classes that preserve recognizability, only wLNT is closed under composition (Gécseg and Steinby, 1984; Baker, 1979; Maletti et al., 2009; Fülöp and Vogler, 2009).","However, the general lack of composability of tree transducers does not preclude us from conducting forward application of a cascade. We revisit the bucket brigade approach, which in Section 2 appeared to be little more than a choice of composition order. As discussed previously, application of a single transducer involves an embedding, a composition, and a projection. The embedded WRTG is in the class wLNT, and the projection forms another WRTG. As long as every transducer in the cascade can be composed with a wLNT to its left or right, depending on the application type, application of a cascade is possible. Note that this embed-compose-project process is some-what more burdensome than in the string case. For strings, application is obtained by a single embedding, a series of compositions, and a single projec-Algorithm 2 COVER 1: inputs 2: u ∈ T∆(Q1 × X) 3: wT M2 = (Q2, ∆, Γ, R2, q2","0) 4: state q2 ∈ Q2 5: outputs 6: set of pairs (z, w) with z ∈ TΓ((Q1 × Q2) × X)","formed by one or more successful runs on u by rules","in R2, starting from q2, and w ∈ R∞","+ the sum of the","weights of all such runs.","7: complexity","8: O(|R2|size(u)",") 9: if u(ε) is of the form (q1, x) ∈ Q1 × X then 10: zinit ← ((q1, q2), x) 11: else 12: zinit ← ⊥ 13: Πlast ← {(zinit, {((ε, ε), q2)}, 1)} 14: for all v ∈ pos(u) such that u(v) ∈ ∆(k)","for some","k ≥ 0 in prefix order do 15: Πv ← ∅ 16: for all (z, θ, w) ∈ Πlast do 17: for all v′","∈ lv(z) such that z(v′",") = ⊥ do 18: for all (θ(v, v′",").u(v)(x1, . . . , xk) w′","−→ h)∈R2","do","19: θ′ ← θ","20: Form substitution mapping φ : (Q2 × X) → TΓ((Q1 × Q2 × X) ∪ {⊥}).","21: for i = 1 to k do","22: for all v′′","∈ pos(h) such that h(v′′",") = (q′","2, xi) for some q′","2 ∈ Q2 do","23: θ′","(vi, v′","v′′",") ← q′","2","24: if u(vi) is of the form","(q1, x) ∈ Q1 × X then","25: φ(q′","2, xi) ← ((q1, q′","2), x) 26: else 27: φ(q′","2, xi) ← ⊥ 28: Πv ← Πv ∪ {(z[φ(h)]v′",", θ′",", w · w′",")} 29: Πlast ← Πv 30: Z ← {z | (z, θ, w) ∈ Πlast} 31: return {(z, X","(z,θ,w)∈Π lastw) | z ∈ Z} tion, whereas application for trees is obtained by a series of (embed, compose, project) operations. 4.1 On-the-fly algorithms We next consider on-the-fly algorithms for application. Similar to the string case, an on-the-fly approach is driven by a calling algorithm that periodically needs to know the productions in a WRTG with a common left side nonterminal. The embed-compose-project approach produces an entire application WRTG before any inference algorithm is run. In order to admit an on-the-fly approach we describe algorithms that only generate those productions in a WRTG that have a given left nonterminal. In this section we extend Definition 3.1 as follows: a WRTG is a 6-tuple G = (N, Σ, P, n0, M , G) where N, Σ, P, and n0 are defined as in Definition 3.1, and either M = G = ∅,10","or M is a wxLNT and G is a normal form, chain production-free WRTG such that 10 In which case the definition is functionally unchanged","from before. 1062 type preserved? source w[x]T No See w[x]NT w[x]LT OQ (Maletti, 2009) w[x]NT No (Gécseg and Steinby, 1984) wxLNT Yes (Fülöp et al., 2010) wLNT Yes (Kuich, 1999)","(a) Preservation of forward recognizability type preserved? source w[x]T No See w[x]NT w[x]LT Yes (Fülöp et al., 2010) w[x]NT No (Maletti, 2009) w[x]LNT Yes See w[x]LT","(b) Preservation of backward recognizability Table 1: Preservation of forward and backward recognizability for various classes of top-down tree transducers.

Tables 2a and 2b summarize the available methods of forward and backward application of cascades for recognizability-preserving tree transducer classes. 5 Decoding Experiments The main purpose of this paper has been to present novel algorithms for performing application. However, it is important to demonstrate these algorithms on real data. We thus demonstrate bucket-brigade and on-the-fly backward application on a typical NLP task cast as a cascade of wLNT.

The Japanese trees are unlabeled, meaning they have syntactic structure but all nodes are labeled “X”. We then cast this modified model as a cascade of LNT tree transducers. Space does not permit a detailed description, but some example rules are in Figure 3. The rotation transducer R, a sample of which is in Figure 3a, has 6,453 rules, the insertion transducer I, Figure 3b, has 8,122 rules, and the translation transducer, T , Figure 3c, has 37,311 rules.","We add an English syntax language model L to the cascade of transducers just described to better simulate an actual machine translation decoding task. The language model is cast as an identity WTT and thus fits naturally into the experimental framework. In our experiments we try several different language models to demonstrate varying performance of the application algorithms. The most realistic language model is a PCFG. Each rule captures the probability of a particular sequence of child labels given a parent label. This model has 7,765 rules.","To demonstrate more extreme cases of the use-fulness of the on-the-fly approach, we build a language model that recognizes exactly the 2,087 trees in the training corpus, each with equal weight. It has 39,455 rules. Finally, to be ultraspecific, we include a form of the “specific” language model just described, but only allow the English counterpart of the particular Japanese sentence being decoded in the language.","The goal in our experiments is to apply a single tree t backward through the cascade L◦R◦I ◦T ◦t and find the 1-best path in the application WRTG. We evaluate the speed of each approach: bucket brigade and on-the-fly. The algorithm we use to obtain the 1-best path is a modification of the k-best algorithm of Pauls and Klein (2009). Our algorithm finds the 1-best path in a WRTG and admits an on-the-fly approach.","The results of the experiments are shown in Table 3. As can be seen, on-the-fly application is generally faster than the bucket brigade, about double the speed per sentence in the traditional LM type method time/sentence pcfg bucket 28s pcfg otf 17s exact bucket >1m exact otf 24s 1-sent bucket 2.5s 1-sent otf .06s Table 3: Timing results to obtain 1-best from application through a weighted tree transducer cascade, using on-the-fly vs. bucket brigade backward application techniques. pcfg = model recognizes any tree licensed by a pcfg built from observed data, exact = model recognizes each of 2,000+ trees with equal weight, 1-sent = model recognizes exactly one tree. experiment that uses an English PCFG language model. The results for the other two language models demonstrate more keenly the potential advantage that an on-the-fly approach provides—the simultaneous incorporation of information from all models allows application to be done more effectively than if each information source is considered in sequence. In the “exact” case, where a very large language model that simply recognizes each of the 2,087 trees in the training corpus is used, the final application is so large that it overwhelms the resources of a 4gb MacBook Pro, while the on-the-fly approach does not suffer from this problem. The “1-sent” case is presented to demonstrate the ripple effect caused by using on-the fly. In the other two cases, a very large language model generally overwhelms the timing statistics, regardless of the method being used. But a language model that represents exactly one sentence is very small, and thus the effects of simultaneous inference are readily apparent—the time to retrieve the 1-best sentence is reduced by two orders of magnitude in this experiment. 6 Conclusion We have presented algorithms for forward and backward application of weighted tree transducer cascades, including on-the-fly variants, and demonstrated the benefit of an on-the-fly approach to application. We note that a more formal approach to application of WTTs is being developed, 1065 independent from these efforts, by Fülöp et al. (2010).
