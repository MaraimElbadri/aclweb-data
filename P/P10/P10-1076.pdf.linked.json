Many SMT frameworks have been developed, including phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2003), hierarchical phrase-based SMT (Chiang, 2005), syntax-based SMT (Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Galley et al., 2006; Cowan et al., 2006), etc. With the emergence of various structurally different SMT systems, more and more studies are focused on combining multiple SMT systems for achieving higher translation accuracy rather than using a single translation system.","The basic idea of system combination is to extract or generate a translation by voting from an ensemble of translation outputs. Depending on how the translation is combined and what voting strategy is adopted, several methods can be used for system combination, e.g. sentence-level combination (Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008) simply selects one from original translations, while some more sophisticated methods, such as word-level and phrase-level combination (Matusov et al., 2006; Rosti et al., 2007), can generate new translations differing from any of the original translations.","One of the key factors in SMT system combination is the diversity in the ensemble of translation outputs (Macherey and Och, 2007). To obtain diversified translation outputs, most of the current system combination methods require multiple translation engines based on different models. However, this requirement cannot be met in many cases, since we do not always have the access to multiple SMT engines due to the high cost of developing and tuning SMT systems. To reduce the burden of system development, it might be a nice way to combine a set of translation systems built from a single translation engine. A key issue here is how to generate an ensemble of diversified translation systems from a single translation engine in a principled way.","Addressing this issue, we propose a boosting-based system combination method to learn a combined translation system from a single SMT engine. In this method, a sequence of weak translation systems is generated from a baseline system in an iterative manner. In each iteration, a new weak translation system is learned, focusing more on the sentences that are relatively poorly translated by the previous weak translation system. Finally, a strong translation system is built from the ensemble of the weak translation systems.","Our experiments are conducted on Chinese-to-English translation in three state-of-the-art SMT systems, including a phrase-based system, a hierarchical phrase-based system and a syntax-based 739 Input: a model u, a sequence of (training) samples {(f1, r1), ..., (fm, rm)} where fi is the i-th source sentence, and ri is the set of reference translations for fi.

However, since most of the boosting algorithms are designed for the classification problem that is very different from the translation problem in natural language processing, several key components have to be redesigned when boosting is adapted to SMT system combination. 3.1 Training In this work, Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) proposed by Och (2003) is used to estimate feature weights λ over a series of training samples. As in other state-of-the-art SMT systems, BLEU is selected as the accuracy measure to define the error function used in MERT. Since the weights of training samples are not taken into account in BLEU2",", we modify the original definition of BLEU to make it sensitive to the distribution Dt(i) over the training samples. The modified version of BLEU is called weighted BLEU (WBLEU) in this paper.","Let E = e1 ... em be the translations produced by the system, R = r1 ... rm be the reference translations where ri = {ri1, ..., riN}, and Dt(i) be the weight of the i-th training sample (fi, ri).

For a given input sentence, each member system has to encode it individually, and the translation speed is inversely proportional to the number of member systems generated by our method. For-tunately, with the thought of computation, there are a number of optimizations that can make the system much more efficient in practice.","A simple solution is to run member systems in parallel when translating a new sentence. Since all the member systems share the same data resources, such as language model and translation table, we only need to keep one copy of the required resources in memory. The translation speed just depends on the computing power of parallel computation environment, such as the number of CPUs.","Furthermore, we can use joint decoding techniques to save the computation of the equivalent translation hypotheses among member systems. In joint decoding of member systems, the search space is structured as a translation hypergraph where the member systems can share their translation hypotheses. If more than one member systems share the same translation hypothesis, we just need to compute the corresponding feature values only once, instead of repeating the computation in individual decoders. In our experiments, we find that over 60% translation hypotheses can be shared among member systems when the number of member systems is over 4. This result indicates that promising speed im-provement can be achieved by using the joint decoding and hypothesis sharing techniques.","Another method to speed up the system is to accelerate n-gram language model with n-gram caching techniques. In this method, a n-gram cache is used to store the most frequently and recently accessed n-grams. When a new n-gram is accessed during decoding, the cache is checked first. If the required n-gram hits the cache, the corresponding n-gram probability is returned by the cached copy rather than refetching the original data in language model. As the translation speed of SMT system depends heavily on the computation of n-gram language model, the acceleration of n-gram language model generally leads to substantial speed-up of SMT system. In our implementation, the n-gram caching in general brings us over 30% speed im-provement of the system. 742"]},{"title":"5 Experiments","paragraphs":["Our experiments are conducted on Chinese-to-English translation in three SMT systems. 5.1 Baseline Systems The first SMT system is a phrase-based system with two reordering models including the maximum entropy-based lexicalized reordering model proposed by Xiong et al.

The test sets are the NIST evaluation sets of MT04, MT05 and MT06. The translation quality is evaluated in terms of case-insensitive NIST version BLEU metric. Statistical significant test is conducted using the bootstrap resampling method proposed by Koehn (2004).","Beam search and cube pruning (Huang and Chiang, 2007) are used to prune the search space in all the three baseline systems.

These results indicate that the SMT systems can benefit more from the diversified outputs of member systems rather than from larger n-best lists produced by a single system. 5.4 Diversity among Member Systems We also study the change of diversity among the outputs of member systems during iterations. The diversity is measured in terms of the Translation Error Rate (TER) metric proposed in (Snover et al., 2006). A higher TER score means that more edit operations are performed if we transform one translation output into another translation output, and thus reflects a larger diversity between the two outputs. In this work, the TER score for a given group of member systems is calculated by averaging the TER scores between the outputs of each pair of member systems in this group.","Figures 6-9 show the curves of diversity on the development and test sets, where the X-axis is the iteration number, and the Y-axis is the diversity. The points at iteration 1 stand for the diversities of baseline systems. In this work, the baseline’s diversity is the TER score of the group of baseline candidates that are generated in advance (Section 5.1).","We see that the diversities of all the systems increase during iterations in most cases, though a few drops occur at a few points. It indicates that our method is very effective to generate diversified member systems. In addition, the diversities of baseline systems (iteration 1) are much lower 745 than those of the systems generated by boosting (iterations 2-30). Together with the results shown in Figures 2-5, it confirms our motivation that the diversified translation outputs can lead to performance improvements over the baseline systems.","Also as shown in Figures 6-9, the diversity of the Hiero system is much lower than that of the phrase-based and syntax-based systems at each individual setting of iteration number. This interesting finding supports the observation that the performance of the Hiero system is relatively more stable than the other two systems as shown in Figures 2-5. The relative lack of diversity in the Hiero system might be due to the spurious ambiguity in Hiero derivations which generally results in very few different translations in translation outputs (Chiang, 2007). 5.5 Evaluation of Oracle Translations In this set of experiments, we evaluate the oracle performance on the n-best lists of the baseline systems and the combined systems generated by boosting-based system combination. Our primary goal here is to study the impact of our method on the upper-bound performance.","Table 2 shows the results, where Baseline+600best stands for the top-600 translation candidates generated by the baseline systems, and Boosting-30iterations stands for the ensemble of 30 member systems’ top-20 translation candidates. As expected, the oracle performance of Boosting-30Iterations is significantly higher than that of Baseline+600best. This result indicates that our method can provide much “better” translation candidates for system combination than enlarging the size of n-best list naively. It also gives us a rational explanation for the significant improvements achieved by our method as shown in Section 5.3."," Data Set","Method Phrase-based","Hiero Syntax-","based Baseline+600best 46.36 46.51 46.92 Dev.

However, Lagarda and Casacuberta (2008)’s method calculated errors over the phrases that were chosen by phrase-based systems, and could not be applied to many other SMT systems, such as hierarchical phrase-based systems and syntax-based systems. Differing from Lagarda and Casacuberta’s work, we are concerned more with proposing a general framework which can work with most of the current SMT models and empirically demonstrating its effectiveness on various SMT systems.","There are also some other studies on building diverse translation systems from a single translation engine for system combination. The first attempt is (Macherey and Och, 2007). They empirically showed that diverse translation systems could be generated by changing parameters at early-stages of the training procedure. Following Macherey and Och (2007)’s work, Duan et al. (2009) proposed a feature subspace method to build a group of translation systems from various different sub-models of an existing SMT system. However, Duan et al. (2009)’s method relied on the heuristics used in feature sub-space selection. For example, they used the remove-one-feature strategy and varied the order of n-gram language model to obtain a satisfactory group of diverse systems. Compared to Duan et al. (2009)’s method, a main advantage of our method is that it can be applied to most of the SMT systems without designing any heuristics to adapt it to the specified systems."]},{"title":"7 Discussion and Future Work","paragraphs":["Actually the method presented in this paper is doing something rather similar to Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) methods. A main difference lies in that the consensus-based combination method here does not model the posterior probability of each hypothesis (i.e. all the hypotheses are assigned an equal posterior probability when we calculate the consensus-based features). 746 Greater improvements are expected if MBR methods are used and consensus-based combination techniques smooth over noise in the MERT pipeline.","In this work, we use a sentence-level system combination method to generate final translations. It is worth studying other more sophisticated alternatives, such as word-level and phrase-level system combination, to further improve the system performance.","Another issue is how to determine an appropriate number of iterations for boosting-based system combination. It is especially important when our method is applied in the real-world applications. Our empirical study shows that the stable and satisfactory improvements can be achieved after 6-8 iterations, while the largest improvements can be achieved after 20 iterations. In our future work, we will study in-depth principled ways to determine the appropriate number of iterations for boosting-based system combination."]},{"title":"8 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have proposed a boosting-based system combination method to address the issue of building a strong translation system from a group of weak translation systems generated from a single SMT engine. We apply our method to three state-of-the-art SMT systems, and conduct experiments on three NIST Chinese-to-English MT evalua-tions test sets. The experimental results show that our method is very effective to improve the translation accuracy of the SMT systems."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China (60873091) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (N090604008).
