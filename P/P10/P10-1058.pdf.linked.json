The model operates over a phrase-based representation of the source document which we obtain by merging information from PCFG parse trees and dependency graphs. Using an integer linear programming formulation, the model learns to select and combine phrases subject to length, coverage and grammar constraints. We evaluate the approach on the task of generating “story highlights”—a small number of brief, self-contained sentences that allow readers to quickly gather information on news stories. Experimental results show that the model’s output is comparable to human-written highlights in terms of both grammaticality and content."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Summarization is the process of condensing a source text into a shorter version while preserving its information content. Humans summarize on a daily basis and effortlessly, but producing high quality summaries automatically remains a challenge. The difficulty lies primarily in the nature of the task which is complex, must satisfy many constraints (e.g., summary length, informativeness, coherence, grammaticality) and ultimately requires wide-coverage text understanding. Since the latter is beyond the capabilities of current NLP technology, most work today focuses on extractive summarization, where a summary is created simply by identifying and subsequently concatenating the most important sentences in a document.","Without a great deal of linguistic analysis, it is possible to create summaries for a wide range of documents. Unfortunately, extracts are often documents of low readability and text quality and contain much redundant information. This is in marked contrast with hand-written summaries which often combine several pieces of information from the original document (Jing, 2002) and exhibit many rewrite operations such as substitutions, insertions, deletions, or reorderings.","Sentence compression is often regarded as a promising first step towards ameliorating some of the problems associated with extractive summarization. The task is commonly expressed as a word deletion problem. It involves creating a short grammatical summary of a single sentence, by removing elements that are considered extraneous, while retaining the most important information (Knight and Marcu, 2002). Interfacing extractive summarization with a sentence compression module could improve the conciseness of the generated summaries and render them more informative (Jing, 2000; Lin, 2003; Zajic et al., 2007).","Despite the bulk of work on sentence compression and summarization (see Clarke and Lapata 2008 and Mani 2001 for overviews) only a handful of approaches attempt to do both in a joint model (Daumé III and Marcu, 2002; Daumé III, 2006; Lin, 2003; Martins and Smith, 2009). One reason for this might be the performance of sentence compression systems which falls short of attaining grammaticality levels of human output. For example, Clarke and Lapata (2008) evaluate a range of state-of-the-art compression systems across different domains and show that machine generated compressions are consistently perceived as worse than the human gold standard. Another reason is the summarization objective itself. If our goal is to summarize news articles, then we may be better off selecting the firstn sentences of the document. This “lead” baseline may err on the side of verbosity but at least will be grammatical, and it has indeed proved extremely hard to outperform by more sophisticated methods (Nenkova, 2005).","In this paper we propose a model for sum-565 marization that incorporates compression into the task. A key insight in our approach is to formulate summarization as a phrase rather than sentence extraction problem. Compression falls naturally out of this formulation as only phrases deemed important should appear in the summary. Obviously, our output summaries must meet additional requirements such as sentence length, overall length, topic coverage and, importantly, grammaticality. We combine phrase and dependency information into a single data structure, which al-lows us to express grammaticality as constraints across phrase dependencies. We encode these constraints through the use of integer linear programming (ILP), a well-studied optimization framework that is able to search the entire solution space efficiently.","We apply our model to the task of generating highlights for a single document. Examples of CNN news articles with human-authored highlights are shown in Table 1. Highlights give a brief overview of the article to allow readers to quickly gather information on stories, and usually appear as bullet points. Importantly, they represent the gist of the entire document and thus often differ substantially from the firstn sentences in the article (Svore et al., 2007). They are also highly compressed, written in a telegraphic style and thus provide an excellent testbed for models that generate compressed summaries. Experimental results show that our model’s output is comparable to hand-written highlights both in terms of grammaticality and informativeness."]},{"title":"2 Related work","paragraphs":["Much effort in automatic summarization has been devoted to sentence extraction which is often for-malized as a classification task (Kupiec et al., 1995). Given appropriately annotated training data, a binary classifier learns to predict for each document sentence if it is worth extracting. Surface-level features are typically used to single out important sentences. These include the presence of certain key phrases, the position of a sentence in the original document, the sentence length, the words in the title, the presence of proper nouns, etc. (Mani, 2001; Sparck Jones, 1999).","Relatively little work has focused on extraction methods for units smaller than sentences. Jing and McKeown (2000) first extract sentences, then remove redundant phrases, and use (manual) recombination rules to produce coherent output. Wan and Paris (2008) segment sentences heuristically into clauses before extraction takes place, and show that this improves summarization quality. In the context of multiple-document summarization, heuristics have also been used to remove parenthetical information (Conroy et al., 2004; Siddharthan et al., 2004). Witten et al. (1999) (among others) extract keyphrases to capture the gist of the document, without however attempting to reconstruct sentences or generate summaries.","A few previous approaches have attempted to interface sentence compression with summarization. A straightforward way to achieve this is by adopting a two-stage architecture (e.g., Lin 2003) where the sentences are first extracted and then compressed or the other way round. Other work implements a joint model where words and sentences are deleted simultaneously from a document. Using a noisy-channel model, Daumé III and Marcu (2002) exploit the discourse structure of a document and the syntactic structure of its sentences in order to decide which constituents to drop but also which discourse units are unimportant. Martins and Smith (2009) formulate a joint sentence extraction and summarization model as an ILP. The latter optimizes an objective function consisting of two parts: an extraction component, essentially a non-greedy variant of max-imal marginal relevance (McDonald, 2007), and a sentence compression component, a more compact reformulation of Clarke and Lapata (2008) based on the output of a dependency parser. Compression and extraction models are trained separately in a max-margin framework and then interpolated. In the context of multi-document summarization, Daumé III’s (2006) vine-growth model creates summaries incrementally, either by start-ing a new sentence or by growing already existing ones.","Our own work is closest to Martins and Smith (2009). We also develop an ILP-based compression and summarization model, however, several key differences set our approach apart. Firstly, content selection is performed at the phrase rather than sentence level. Secondly, the combination of phrase and dependency information into a single data structure is new, and important in allowing us to express grammaticality as constraints across phrase dependencies, rather than resorting to a lan-566 Most blacks say MLK’s vision fulfilled, poll finds WASHINGTON (CNN) – More than two-thirds of African-Americans believe Martin Luther King Jr.’s vision for race relations has been fulfilled, a CNN poll found – a figure up sharply from a survey in early 2008. The CNN-Opinion Research Corp. survey was released Monday, a federal holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader and a day before Barack Obama is to be sworn in as the first black U.S. president. The poll found 69 percent of blacks said King’s vision has been fulfilled in the more than 45 years since his 1963 ’I have a dream’ speech – roughly double the 34 percent who agreed with that assessment in a similar poll taken last March. But whites remain less optimistic, the survey found. • 69 percent of blacks polled say Martin Luther King Jr’s","vision realized. • Slim majority of whites say King’s vision not fulfilled. • King gave his “I have a dream” speech in 1963. 9/11 billboard draws flak from Florida Democrats, GOP (CNN) – A Florida man is using billboards with an image of the burning World Trade Center to encourage votes for a Republican presidential candidate, drawing criticism for politicizing the 9/11 attacks. ‘Please Don’t Vote for a Democrat’ reads the type over the picture of the twin towers after hijacked airliners hit them on September, 11, 2001.

Lastly, our model is more compact, has fewer parameters, and does not require two training procedures. Our approach bears some resemblance to headline generation (Dorr et al., 2003; Banko et al., 2000), although we output several sentences rather than a single one. Headline generation models typically extract individual words from a document to produce a very short summary, whereas we extract phrases and ensure that they are combined into grammatical sentences through our ILP constraints.","Svore et al. (2007) were the first to foreground the highlight generation task which we adopt as an evaluation testbed for our model. Their approach is however a purely extractive one. Using an algorithm based on neural networks and third-party resources (e.g., news query logs and Wikipedia entries) they rank sentences and select the three highest scoring ones as story highlights. In contrast, we aim to generate rather than extract highlights. As a first step we focus on deleting extraneous material, but other more sophisticated rewrite operations (e.g., Cohn and Lapata 2009) could be incorporated into our framework."]},{"title":"3 The Task","paragraphs":["Given a document, we aim to produce three or four short sentences covering its main topics, much like the “Story Highlights” accompanying the (online) CNN news articles. CNN highlights are written by humans; we aim to do this automatically.","Documents Highlights Sentences 37.2 ± 39.6 3.5 ± 0.5 Tokens 795.0 ± 744.8 47.0 ± 9.6 Tokens/sentence 22.4 ± 4.2 13.3 ± 1.7 Table 2: Overview statistics on the corpus of documents and highlights (mean and standard devia-tion). A minority of documents are transcripts of interviews and speeches, and can be very long; this accounts for the very large standard deviation.","Two examples of a news story and its associated highlights, are shown in Table 1. As can be seen, the highlights are written in a compressed, almost telegraphic manner. Articles, auxiliaries and forms of the verb be are often deleted. Compression is also achieved through paraphrasing, e.g., substitutions and reorderings. For example, the document sentence “ The poll found 69 percent of blacks said King’s vision has been fulfilled.” is rephrased in the highlight as “ 69 percent of blacks polled say Martin Luther King Jr’s vision realized.”. In general, there is a fair amount of lexical overlap between document sentences and highlights (42.44%) but the correspondence between document sentences and highlights is not always one-to-one. In the first example in Table 1, the second paragraph gives rise to two highlights. Also note that the highlights need not form a coherent summary, each of them is relatively stand-alone, and there is little co-referencing between them. 567 (a) S S CC But NP NNS whites VP VBP remain ADJP RBR less JJ optimistic , , NP DT the NN survey VP VBD found . .

Some overview statistics of the corpus are shown in Table 2. Overall, we observe a high degree of compression both at the document and sentence level. The highlights summary tends to be ten times shorter than the corresponding article. Furthermore, individual highlights have almost half the length of document sentences."]},{"title":"4 Modeling","paragraphs":["The objective of our model is to create the most informative story highlights possible, subject to constraints relating to sentence length, overall summary length, topic coverage, and grammaticality. These constraints are global in their scope, and cannot be adequately satisfied by optimizing each one of them individually. Our approach therefore uses an ILP formulation which will provide a globally optimal solution, and which can be efficiently solved using standard optimization tools. Specifically, the model selects phrases from which to form the highlights, and each highlight is created from a single sentence through phrase deletion. The model operates on parse trees augmented with 1 The corpus is available from http://homepages.inf.","ed.ac.uk/mlap/resources/index.html. dependency labels. We first describe how we obtain this representation and then move on to discuss the model in more detail. Sentence Representation We obtain syntactic information by parsing every sentence twice, once with a phrase structure parser and once with a dependency parser. The phrase structure and dependency-based representations for the sentence “ But whites remain less optimistic, the survey found.” (from Table 1) are shown in Figures 1(a) and 1(b), respectively.","We then combine the output from the two parsers, by mapping the dependencies to the edges of the phrase structure tree in a greedy fashion, shown in Figure 2(a). Starting at the top node of the dependency graph, we choose a node i and a dependency arc to node j. We locate the corresponding words i and j on the phrase structure tree, and locate their nearest shared ancestor p. We assign the label of the dependency i → j to the first unlabeled edge from p to j in the phrase structure tree. Edges assigned with dependency labels are shown as dashed lines. These edges are important to our formulation, as they will be represented by binary decision variables in the ILP. Further edges from p to j, and all the edges from p to i, are marked as fixed and shown as solid lines. In this way we keep the correct ordering of leaf nodes. Finally, leaf nodes are merged into parent phrases, until each phrase node contains a minimum of two tokens, shown in Figure 2(b). Because of this minimum length rule, it is possible for a merged node to be a clause rather than a phrase, but in the subsequent description we will use the term phrase rather loosely to describe any merged leaf node. 568 (a) S S CC But NP NNS whites nsubj VP VBP remain cop ADJP RBR less advmod JJ optimistic ccomp , , NP DT the det NN survey nsubj VP VBD found . .

The parent node p of the current node i must always be included if i is, unless the edge p → i is of type ccomp (clausal complement) or advcl (adverbial clause), in which case it is possible to include i without including p.","Consider again the example in Figure 2(b). There are only two possible outputs from this sentence. If the phrase “ the survey” is chosen, then the parent node “ found” will be included, and from our first rule the ccomp phrase must also be included, which results in the output: “ But whites remain less optimistic, the survey found.” If, on the other hand, the clause “ But whites remain less optimistic” is chosen, then due to our second rule there is no constraint that forces the parent phrase “ found” to be included in the highlights. Without other factors influencing the decision, this would give the output: “ But whites remain less optimistic.” We can see from this example that encod-ing the possible outputs as decisions on branches of the phrase structure tree provides a more compact representation of many options than would be possible with an explicit enumeration of all possible compressions. Which output is chosen (if any) depends on the scores of the phrases involved, and the influence of the other constraints.","Constraint (1g) tells the ILP to create a highlight if one of its constituent phrases is chosen.

Two annotators manually aligned the highlights and document sentences. Specifically, each sentence in the document was assigned one of three alignment labels: must be in the summary (1), could be in the summary (2), and is not in the summary (3). The annotators were asked to label document sentences whose content was identical to the highlights as “must be in the summary”, sentences with partially overlapping content as “could be in the summary” and the remainder as “should not be in the summary”. Inter-annotator agreement was .82 (p < 0.01, using Spearman’s ρ rank correlation). The mapping of sentence labels to phrase labels was unsupervised: if the phrase came from a sentence labeled (1), and there was a unigram overlap (excluding stop words) between the phrase and any of the original highlights, we marked this phrase with a positive label. All other phrases were marked negative.","Our feature set comprised surface features such as sentence and paragraph position information, POS tags, unigram and bigram overlap with the title, and whether high-scoring tf.idf words were present in the phrase (66 features in total). The 210 documents produced a training set of 42,684 phrases (3,334 positive and 39,350 negative). We learned the feature weights with a linear SVM, using the software SVM-OOPS (Woodsend and Gondzio, 2009). This tool gave us directly the feature weights as well as support vector values, and it allowed different penalties to be applied to positive and negative misclassifications, enabling us to compensate for the unbalanced data set. The penalty hyper-parameters chosen were the ones that gave the best F-scores, using 10-fold valida-tion. Highlight generation We generated highlights for a test set of 600 documents. We created and 570 solved an ILP for each document. Sentences were first tokenized to separate words and punctuation, then parsed to obtain phrases and dependencies as described in Section 4 using the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003). For each phrase, features were extracted and salience scores calculated from the feature weights determined through SVM training. The distance from the SVM hyperplane represents the salience score. The ILP model (see Equation (1)) was parametrized as follows: the maximum number of highlights NS was 4, the overall limit on length LT was 75 tokens, the length of each highlight was in the range of [8, 28] tokens, and the topic coverage set"]},{"title":"T","paragraphs":["contained the top 5 tf.idf words. These parameters were chosen to capture the properties seen in the majority of the training set; they were also relaxed enough to allow a feasible solution of the ILP model (with hard constraints) for all the documents in the test set. To solve the ILP model we used the ZIB Optimization Suite software (Achterberg, 2007; Koch, 2004; Wunderling, 1996). The solution was converted into highlights by concatenating the chosen leaf nodes in order. The ILP problems we created had on average 290 binary variables and 380 constraints. The mean solve time was 0.03 seconds. Summarization In order to examine the generality of our model and compare with previous work, we also evaluated our system on a vanilla summarization task.

Evaluation We evaluated summarization quality using ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003). For the highlight generation task, the original CNN highlights were used as the reference. We report unigram overlap (ROUGE-1) as a means of assessing informativeness and the longest common subsequence (ROUGE-L) as a means of assessing fluency.","In addition, we evaluated the generated highlights by eliciting human judgments. Participants were presented with a news article and its corresponding highlights and were asked to rate the latter along three dimensions: informativeness (do the highlights represent the article’s main topics?), grammaticality (are they fluent?), and verbosity (are they overly wordy and repetitive?). The subjects used a seven point rating scale. An ideal system would receive high numbers for grammaticality and informativeness and a low number for verbosity. We randomly selected nine documents from the test set and generated highlights with our model and the sentence-based ILP baseline. We also included the original highlights as a gold standard.

A key aspect of our approach is the representation of content by phrases rather than entire sentences. Salient phrases are selected to form the summary. Grammaticality, length and coverage requirements are encoded as constraints in an integer linear program. Applying the model to the generation of “story highlights” (and single document summaries) shows that it is a viable alternative to extraction-based systems. Both ROUGE scores and the results of our human study","ROUGE-1 ROUGE-2 ROUGE-L Leading-3 .400 ± .018 .184 ± .015 .374 ± .017 M&S (2009) .403 ± .076 .180 ± .076 — ILP sentence .430 ± .014 .191 ± .015 .401 ± .014 ILP phrase .445 ± .014 .200 ± .014 .419 ± .014 Table 7: ROUGE results on DUC-2002 corpus (140 documents). —: only ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 results are given in Martins and Smith (2009). confirm that our system manages to create summaries at a high compression rate and yet maintain the informativeness and grammaticality of a competitive extractive system. The model itself is relatively simple and knowledge-lean, and achieves good performance without reference to any resources outside the corpus collection.","Future extensions are many and varied. An obvious next step is to examine how the model generalizes to other domains and text genres. Although coherence is not so much of an issue for highlights, it certainly plays a role when generating standard summaries. The ILP model can be straightforwardly augmented with discourse constraints similar to those proposed in Clarke and Lapata (2007). We would also like to generalize the model to arbitrary rewrite operations, as our results indicate that compression rates are likely to improve with more sophisticated paraphrasing."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Andreas Grothey and members of ICCS at the School of Informatics for the valuable discussions and comments through-out this work.
