But although many young researchers in natural language processing are very well trained in machine learning and statistical methods, they often lack the necessary background to understand the linguistic motivation behind these formalisms. Furthermore, in many linguistics departments, syntax is still taught from a purely Chomskian perspective. Additionally, research on these formalisms often takes place within tightly-knit, formalismspecific subcommunities. It is therefore often difficult for outsiders as well as experts to grasp the commonalities of and differences between these formalisms."]},{"title":"2 Content Overview","paragraphs":["This tutorial overviews basic ideas of TAG/ CCG/LFG/HPSG, and provides attendees with a comparison of these formalisms from a linguistic and computational point of view. We start from stating the motivation behind using these expressive grammar formalisms for NLP, contrasting them with shallow formalisms like context-free grammars. We introduce a common set of examples illustrating various linguistic constructions that elude context-free grammars, and reuse them when introducing each formalism: bounded and unbounded non-local dependencies that arise through extraction and coordination, scrambling, mappings to meaning representations, etc. In the second half of the tutorial, we explain two key technologies for wide-coverage NLP with these grammar formalisms: grammar acquisition and parsing models. Finally, we show NLP applications where these expressive grammar formalisms provide additional benefits."]},{"title":"3 Tutorial Outline","paragraphs":["1. Introduction: Why expressive grammars 2.
