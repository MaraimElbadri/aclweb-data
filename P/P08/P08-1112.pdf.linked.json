Despite much recent work on word alignment methods, alignment accuracy increases often produce little or no improvements in machine translation quality. In this work we analyze a recently proposed agreement-constrained EM algorithm for unsupervised alignment models. We attempt to tease apart the effects that this simple but effective modification has on alignment precision and recall trade-offs, and how rare and common words are affected across several language pairs. We propose and extensively evaluate a simple method for using alignment models to produce alignments better-suited for phrase-based MT systems, and show significant gains (as measured by BLEU score) in end-to-end translation systems for six languages pairs used in recent MT competitions."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The typical pipeline for a machine translation (MT) system starts with a parallel sentence-aligned corpus and proceeds to align the words in every sentence pair. The word alignment problem has received much recent attention, but improvements in standard measures of word alignment performance often do not result in better translations. Fraser and Marcu (2007) note that none of the tens of papers published over the last five years has shown that significant decreases in alignment error rate (AER) result in significant increases in translation performance. In this work, we show that by changing the way the word alignment models are trained and used, we can get not only improvements in alignment performance, but also in the performance of the MT system that uses those alignments.","We present extensive experimental results evaluating a new training scheme for unsupervised word alignment models: an extension of the Expectation Maximization algorithm that allows effective injection of additional information about the desired alignments into the unsupervised training process. Examples of such information include “one word should not translate to many words” or that directional translation models should agree. The general framework for the extended EM algorithm with posterior constraints of this type was proposed by (Graca̧ et al., 2008). Our contribution is a large scale evaluation of this methodology for word alignments, an investigation of how the produced alignments differ and how they can be used to consistently improve machine translation performance (as measured by BLEU score) across many languages on training corpora with up to hundred thousand sentences. In 10 out of 12 cases we improve BLEU score by at least 1","4 point and by more than 1 point in 4 out of 12 cases.","After presenting the models and the algorithm in Sections 2 and 3, in Section 4 we examine how the new alignments differ from standard models, and find that the new method consistently improves word alignment performance, measured either as alignment error rate or weighted F-score. Section 5 explores how the new alignments lead to consistent and significant improvement in a state of the art phrase base machine translation by using posterior decoding rather than Viterbi decoding. We propose a heuristic for tuning posterior decoding in the absence of annotated alignment data and show improvements over baseline systems for six different 986 language pairs used in recent MT competitions."]},{"title":"2 Statistical word alignment","paragraphs":["Statistical word alignment (Brown et al., 1994) is the task identifying which words are translations of each other in a bilingual sentence corpus. Figure 2 shows two examples of word alignment of a sentence pair. Due to the ambiguity of the word alignment task, it is common to distinguish two kinds of alignments (Och and Ney, 2003). Sure alignments (S), represented in the figure as squares with borders, for single-word translations and possible alignments (P), represented in the figure as alignments without boxes, for translations that are either not exact or where several words in one language are translated to several words in the other language. Possible alignments can can be used either to indicated optional alignments, such as the translation of an idiom, or disagreement between annotators. In the figure red/black dots indicates correct/incorrect predicted alignment points. 2.1 Baseline word alignment models We focus on the hidden Markov model (HMM) for alignment proposed by (Vogel et al., 1996). This is a generalization of IBM models 1 and 2 (Brown et al., 1994), where the transition probabilities have a first-order Markov dependence rather than a zerothorder dependence. The model is an HMM, where the hidden states take values from the source language words and generate target language words according to a translation table. The state transitions depend on the distance between the source language words. For source sentence s the probability of an alignment a and target sentence t can be expressed as: p(t, a | s) = ∏ j pd(aj|aj − aj−1)pt(tj|saj ), (1) where aj is the index of the hidden state (source language index) generating the target language word at index j. As usual, a “null” word is added to the source sentence. Figure 1 illustrates the mapping between the usual HMM notation and the HMM alignment model. 2.2 Baseline training All word alignment models we consider are normally trained using the Expectation Maximization s1 s1 s2 s3 we know the way sabemos el camino null","usual HMM word alignment meaning Si (hidden) source language word i Oj (observed) target language word j aij (transition) distortion model bij (emission) translation model Figure 1: Illustration of an HMM for word alignment. (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977). The EM algorithm attempts to maximize the marginal likelihood of the observed data (s, t pairs) by repeatedly finding a maximal lower bound on the likelihood and finding the maximal point of the lower bound. The lower bound is constructed by using posterior probabilities of the hidden alignments (a) and can be optimized in closed form from expected sufficient statistics computed from the posteriors. For the HMM alignment model, these posteriors can be efficiently calculated by the Forward-Backward algorithm."]},{"title":"3 Adding agreement constraints","paragraphs":["Graca̧ et al. (2008) introduce an augmentation of the EM algorithm that uses constraints on posteriors to guide learning. Such constraints are useful for several reasons. As with any unsupervised induction method, there is no guarantee that the maximum likelihood parameters correspond to the intended meaning for the hidden variables, that is, more accu-rate alignments using the resulting model. Introduc-ing additional constraints into the model often results in intractable decoding and search errors (e.g., IBM models 4+). The advantage of only constrain-ing the posteriors during training is that the model remains simple while respecting more complex requirements. For example, constraints might include “one word should not translate to many words” or that translation is approximately symmetric.","The modification is to add a KL-projection step after the E-step of the EM algorithm. For each sentence pair instance x = (s, t), we find the posterior 987 distribution pθ(z|x) (where z are the alignments). In regular EM, pθ(z|x) is used to complete the data and compute expected counts. Instead, we find the distribution q that is as close as possible to pθ(z|x) in KL subject to constraints specified in terms of expected values of features f (x, z)","arg min q KL(q(z) || pθ(z|x)) s.t. Eq[f (x, z)] ≤ b.","(2) The resulting distribution q is then used in place of pθ(z|x) to compute sufficient statistics for the M-step. The algorithm converges to a local maximum of the log of the marginal likelihood, pθ(x) =∑","z pθ(z, x), penalized by the KL distance of the posteriors pθ(z|x) from the feasible set defined by the constraints (Graca̧ et al., 2008):","Ex[log pθ(x) − min q:Eq[f(x,z)]≤b KL(q(z) || pθ(z|x))], where Ex is expectation over the training data. They suggest how this framework can be used to encourage two word alignment models to agree during training. We elaborate on their description and provide details of implementation of the projection in Equation 2. 3.1 Agreement Most MT systems train an alignment model in each direction and then heuristically combine their predictions. In contrast, Graca̧ et al. encourage the models to agree by training them concurrently. The intuition is that the errors that the two models make are different and forcing them to agree rules out errors only made by one model. This is best exhibited in the rare word alignments, where one-sided “garbage-collection” phenomenon often occurs (Moore, 2004). This idea was previously proposed by (Matusov et al., 2004; Liang et al., 2006) although the the objectives differ.","In particular, consider a feature that takes on value 1 whenever source word i aligns to target word j in the forward model and -1 in the backward model. If this feature has expected value 0 under the mixture of the two models, then the forward model and backward model agree on how likely source word i is to align to target word j. More formally denote the forward model −→p (z) and backward model ←−p (z) where −→p (z) = 0 for z /∈ −→","Z and ←−p (z) = 0 for z /∈ ←−","Z (−→ Z and ←− Z are possible forward and backward align-","ments).

Eq[f (x, z)] = 0.","(3) The optimization problem in Equation 3 can be efficiently solved in its dual formulation:","arg min λ log ∑ z","pθ(z | x) exp {λ⊤ f (x, z)} (4)","where we have solved for the primal variables q as: qλ(z) = pθ(z | x) exp{λ⊤","f (x, z)}/Z, (5) with Z a normalization constant that ensures q sums to one. We have only one dual variable per constraint, and we optimize them by taking a few gradient steps. The partial derivative of the objective in Equation 4 with respect to feature i is simply Eqλ[fi(x, z)]. So we have reduced the problem to computing expectations of our features under the model q. It turns out that for the agreement features, this reduces to computing expectations under the normal HMM model. To see this, we have by the definition of qλ and pθ, qλ(z) =","−→p (z | x) + ←−p (z | x) 2","exp{λ⊤ f (x, z)}/Z =","−→q (z) + ←−q (z) 2 .

The standard way to do this is to find the most probable alignment, using the Viterbi algorithm. Another alternative is to use posterior decoding. In posterior decoding, we compute for each source word i and target word j the posterior probability under our model that i aligns to j. If that probability is greater than some threshold, then we include the point i − j in our final alignment. There are two main differences between posterior decoding and Viterbi decoding. First, posterior decoding can take better advantage of model uncertainty: when several likely alignment have high probability, posteriors accumulate confidence for the edges common to many good alignments. Viterbi, by contrast, must commit to one high-scoring alignment.

Figure 2 shows two machine-generated alignments of a sentence pair. The black dots represent the machine alignments and the shading represents the human annotation (as described in the previous section), on the left using the regular HMM model and on the right using our agreement constraints. The figure illustrates a problem known as garbage collection (Brown et al., 1993), where rare source words tend to align to many target words, since the probability mass of the rare word translations can be hijacked to fit the sentence pair. Agreement constraints solve this problem, because forward and backward models cannot agree on the garbage collection solution.","Graca̧ et al. (2008) show that alignment error rate (Och and Ney, 2003) can be improved with agreement constraints. Since AER is the standard metric for alignment quality, we reproduce their results using all the sentences of length at most 40. For the Hansards corpus we improve from 15.35 to 7.01 for the English → French direction and from 14.45 to 6.80 for the reverse. For English → Spanish we improve from 28.20 to 19.86 and from 27.54 to 19.18 for the reverse. These values are competitive with other state of the art systems (Liang et al., 2006).","Unfortunately, as was shown by Fraser and Marcu (2007) AER can have weak correlation with translation performance as measured by BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002), when the alignments are used to train a phrase-based translation system. Consequently, in addition to AER, we focus on precision and recall.","Figure 3 shows the change in precision and recall with the amount of provided training data for the Hansards corpus.

We see a similar improvement on the EPPS corpus.","Motivated by the garbage collection problem, we also analyze common and rare words separately. Figure 4 shows precision and recall learning curves for rare and common words. We see that agreement constraints improve precision but not recall of rare words and improve recall but not precision of common words.","As described above an alternative to Viterbi decoding is to accept all alignments that have probability above some threshold. By changing the threshold, we can trade off precision and recall. Figure 5 compares this tradeoff for the baseline and agreement model. We see that the precision/recall curve for agreement is entirely above the baseline curve, so for any recall value we can achieve higher precision than the baseline for either corpus. In Figure 6 we break down the same analysis into rare and non rare words.","Figure 7 shows an example of the same sentence, using the same model where in one case Viterbi decoding was used and in the other case Posterior decoding tuned to minimize AER on a development set 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Recall Precision Baseline Agreement","0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Recall Precision Baseline Agreement Figure 5: Precision and recall trade-off for posterior decoding with varying threshold.

The baseline system uses GIZA model 4 alignments and the open source Moses phrase-based machine translation toolkit2",", and performed close to the best at the competition last year.","For all experiments the experimental setup is as follows: we lowercase the corpora, and train language models from all available data. The reason-ing behind this is that even if bilingual texts might be scarce in some domain, monolingual text should be relatively abundant. We then train the competing alignment models and compute competing alignments using different decoding schemes. For each alignment model and decoding type we train Moses and use MERT optimization to tune its parameters on a development set. Moses is trained using the grow-diag-final-and alignment symmetriza-tion heuristic and using the default distance base distortion model. We report BLEU scores using a script available with the baseline system. The competing alignment models are GIZA Model 4, our implementation of the baseline HMM alignment and our agreement HMM. We would like to stress that the fair comparison is between the performance of the baseline HMM and the agreement HMM, since Model 4 is more complicated and can capture more structure. However, we will see that for moderate sized data the agreement HMM performs better than both its baseline and GIZA Model 4. 5.1 Corpora In addition to the Hansards corpus and the Europarl English-Spanish corpus, we used four other corpora for the machine translation experiments.

We also report the percentage of tokens in the test corpus that are rare or not encountered in the training corpus. 5.2 Decoding Our initial experiments with Viterbi decoding and posterior decoding showed that for our agreement model posterior decoding could provide better alignment quality. When labeled data is available, we can tune the threshold to minimize AER. When labeled data is not available we use a different heuristic to 991 tune the threshold: we choose a threshold that gives the same number of aligned points as Viterbi decoding produces. In principle, we would like to tune the threshold by optimizing BLEU score on a development set, but that is impractical for experiments with many pairs of languages. We call this heuristic posterior-points decoding. As we shall see, it performs well in practice. 5.3 Training data size The HMM alignment models have a smaller parameter space than GIZA Model 4, and consequently we would expect that they would perform better when the amount of training data is limited. We found that this is generally the case, with the margin by which we beat model 4 slowly decreasing until a crossing point somewhere in the range of 105","- 106","sentences. We will see in section 5.3.1 that the Viterbi decoding performs best for the baseline HMM model, while posterior decoding performs best for our agreement HMM model. Figure 8 shows the BLEU score for the baseline HMM, our agreement model and GIZA Model 4 as we vary the amount of training data from 104","- 106","sentences. For all but the largest data sizes we outperform Model 4, with a greater margin at lower training data sizes. This trend continues as we lower the amount of training data further. We see a similar trend with other corpora. 5.3.1 Small to Medium Training Sets","Our next set of experiments look at our performance in both directions across our 6 corpora, when we have small to moderate amounts of training data: for the language pairs with more than 100,000 sentences, we use only the first 100,000 sentences. Table 2 shows the performance of all systems on these datasets. In the table, post-pts and post-aer stand for posterior-points decoding and posterior decoding tuned for AER. With the notable exception of Czech and Italian, our system performs better than or comparable to both baselines, even though it uses a much more limited model than GIZA’s Model 4. The small corpora for which our models do not perform as well as GIZA are the ones with a lot of rare words. We suspect that the reason for this is that we do not implement smoothing, which has been shown to be important, especially in situations with a lot of rare words.","X → En En → X","Base Agree Base Agree GIZA M4 23.92 17.89","De Viterbi 24.08 23.59 18.15 18.13 post-pts 24.24 24.65(+)","18.18 18.45(+) GIZA M4 18.29 11.05","Fi Viterbi 18.79 18.38 11.17 11.54 post-pts 18.88 19.45(++)","11.47 12.48(++) GIZA M4 33.12 26.90","Fr Viterbi 32.42 32.15 25.85 25.48 post-pts 33.06 33.09(≈)","25.94 26.54(+) post-aer 31.81 33.53(+)","26.14 26.68(+) GIZA M4 30.24 30.09","Es Viterbi 29.65 30.03 29.76 29.85 post-pts 29.91 30.22(++)","29.71 30.16(+) post-aer 29.65 30.34(++)","29.78 30.20(+) GIZA M4 51.66 41.99","It Viterbi 52.20 52.09 41.40 41.28 post-pts 51.06 51.14(−−)","41.63 41.79(≈) GIZA M4 22.78 12.75","Cz Viterbi 21.25 21.89 12.23 12.33 post-pts 21.37 22.51(++)","12.16 12.47(+) Table 2: BLEU scores for all language pairs using up to 100k sentences.

We tested this hypothesis on six different language pairs from three different domains, and found that the new alignment scheme not only performs better than the baseline, but also improves over a more complicated, intractable model. In order to get the best results, it appears that posterior decoding is required for the simplistic HMM alignment model. The success of posterior decoding using our simple threshold tuning heuristic is fortunate since no labeled alignment data are needed: Viterbi alignments provide a reasonable estimate of aligned words needed for phrase extraction. The nature of the complicated relationship between word alignments, the corresponding extracted phrases and the effects on the final MT system still begs for better explanations and metrics. We have investigated the distribution of phrase-sizes used in translation across systems and languages, following recent investigations (Ayan and Dorr, 2006), but unfortunately found no consistent correlation with BLEU improvement. Since the alignments we extracted were better according to all metrics we used, it should not be too surprising that they yield better translation performance, but perhaps a better trade-off can be achieved with a deeper understanding of the link between alignments and translations.
