To avoid error propagation and improve segmentation by utilizing POS information, segmentation and tagging can be performed simultaneously. A challenge for this joint approach is the large combined search space, which makes efficient decoding very hard. Recent research has explored the integration of segmentation and POS tagging, by decoding under restricted versions of the full combined search space. In this paper, we propose a joint segmentation and POS tagging model that does not impose any hard constraints on the interaction between word and POS information. Fast decoding is achieved by using a novel multiple-beam search algorithm. The system uses a discriminative statistical model, trained using the generalized perceptron algorithm. The joint model gives an error reduction in segmentation accuracy of 14.6% and an error reduction in tagging accuracy of 12.2%, compared to the traditional pipeline approach."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Since Chinese sentences do not contain explicitly marked word boundaries, word segmentation is a necessary step before POS tagging can be performed. Typically, a Chinese POS tagger takes segmented in-puts, which are produced by a separate word segmentor. This two-step approach, however, has an obvious flaw of error propagation, since word segmentation errors cannot be corrected by the POS tagger. A better approach would be to utilize POS information to improve word segmentation. For example, the POS-word pattern “number word” + “ (a common measure word)” can help in segmenting the character sequence “” into the word sequence “ (one) (measure word) (person)” instead of “ (one) (personal; adj)”. More-over, the comparatively rare POS pattern “number word” + “number word” can help to prevent segmenting a long number word into two words.","In order to avoid error propagation and make use of POS information for word segmentation, segmentation and POS tagging can be viewed as a single task: given a raw Chinese input sentence, the joint POS tagger considers all possible segmented and tagged sequences, and chooses the overall best output. A major challenge for such a joint system is the large search space faced by the decoder. For a sentence with n characters, the number of possible output sequences is O(2n−1","· T n","), where T is the size of the tag set. Due to the nature of the combined candidate items, decoding can be inefficient even with dynamic programming.","Recent research on Chinese POS tagging has started to investigate joint segmentation and tagging, reporting accuracy improvements over the pipeline approach. Various decoding approaches have been used to reduce the combined search space. Ng and Low (2004) mapped the joint segmentation and POS tagging task into a single character sequence tagging problem. Two types of tags are assigned to each character to represent its segmentation and POS. For example, the tag “b NN” indicates a character at the beginning of a noun. Using this method, POS features are allowed to interact with segmentation. 888 Since tagging is restricted to characters, the search space is reduced to O((4T ) n","), and beam search decoding is effective with a small beam size. However, the disadvantage of this model is the difficulty in incorporating whole word information into POS tagging. For example, the standard “word + POS tag” feature is not explicitly applicable. Shi and Wang (2007) introduced POS information to segmentation by reranking. N -best segmentation outputs are passed to a separately-trained POS tagger, and the best output is selected using the overall POS-segmentation probability score. In this system, the decoding for word segmentation and POS tagging are still performed separately, and exact inference for both is possible. However, the interaction between POS and segmentation is restricted by reranking: POS information is used to improve segmentation only for the N segmentor outputs.","In this paper, we propose a novel joint model for Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging, which does not limiting the interaction between segmentation and POS information in reducing the combined search space. Instead, a novel multiple beam search algorithm is used to do decoding efficiently. Candidate ranking is based on a discriminative joint model, with features being extracted from segmented words and POS tags simultaneously. The training is performed by a single generalized perceptron (Collins, 2002). In experiments with the Chinese Treebank data, the joint model gave an error reduction of 14.6% in segmentation accuracy and 12.2% in the overall segmentation and tagging accuracy, compared to the traditional pipeline approach. In addition, the overall results are comparable to the best systems in the literature, which exploit knowledge outside the training data, even though our system is fully data-driven.","Different methods have been proposed to reduce error propagation between pipelined tasks, both in general (Sutton et al., 2004; Daumé III and Marcu, 2005; Finkel et al., 2006) and for specific problems such as language modeling and utterance classifica-tion (Saraclar and Roark, 2005) and labeling and chunking (Shimizu and Haas, 2006).

The features used by the baseline segmentor are shown in Table 1.

Other morphological features from Tseng et al. (2005) are not used because they require extra web corpora besides the training data.","During training, the baseline POS tagger stores special word-tag pairs into a tag dictionary (Ratnaparkhi, 1996). Such information is used by the decoder to prune unlikely tags. For each word occurring more than N times in the training data, the decoder can only assign a tag the word has been seen with in the training data. This method led to improvement in the decoding speed as well as the output accuracy for English POS tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996). Besides tags for frequent words, our baseline POS tagger also uses the tag dictionary to store closed-set tags (Xia, 2000) – those associated only with a limited number of Chinese words."]},{"title":"3 Joint Segmentation and Tagging Model","paragraphs":["In this section, we build a joint word segmentation and POS tagging model that uses exactly the same source of information as the baseline system, by applying the feature templates from the baseline word segmentor and POS tagger. No extra knowledge is used by the joint model. However, because word segmentation and POS tagging are performed simultaneously, POS information participates in word segmentation. 3.1 Formulation of the joint model We formulate joint word segmentation and POS tagging as a single problem, which maps a raw Chinese sentence to a segmented and POS tagged output. Given an input sentence x, the output F (x) satisfies:","F (x) = arg max y∈GEN(x) Score(y) where GEN(x) represents the set of possible outputs for x.","Score(y) is computed by a feature-based linear model. Denoting the global feature vector for the tagged sentence y with Φ(y), we have: Score(y) = Φ(y) · ⃗w where ⃗w is the parameter vector in the model. Each element in ⃗w gives a weight to its corresponding element in Φ(y), which is the count of a particular feature over the whole sentence y. We calculate the ⃗w value by supervised learning, using the averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002), given in Figure 1. 1","We take the union of feature templates from the baseline segmentor (Table 1) and POS tagger (Table 2) as the feature templates for the joint system. All features are treated equally and processed together according to the linear model, regardless of whether they are from the baseline segmentor or tagger. In fact, most features from the baseline POS tagger, when used in the joint model, represent segmentation patterns as well. For example, the aforementioned pattern “number word” + “”, which is","1","In order to provide a comparison for the perceptron algorithm we also tried SVMstruct (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004) for parameter estimation, but this training method was prohibitively slow. 890 Inputs: training examples (xi, yi) Initialization: set ⃗w = 0 Algorithm: for t = 1..T , i = 1..N","calculate zi = arg maxy∈GEN(xi) Φ(y) · ⃗w","if zi ̸= yi","⃗w = ⃗w + Φ(yi) − Φ(zi) Outputs: ⃗w Figure 1: The perceptron learning algorithm useful only for the POS “number word” in the baseline tagger, is also an effective indicator of the segmentation of the two words (especially “”) in the joint model. 3.2 The decoding algorithm One of the main challenges for the joint segmentation and POS tagging system is the decoding algorithm. The speed and accuracy of the decoder is important for the perceptron learning algorithm, but the system faces a very large search space of combined candidates. Given the linear model and feature templates, exact inference is very hard even with dynamic programming.","Experiments with the standard beam-search decoder described in (Zhang and Clark, 2007) resulted in low accuracy. This beam search algorithm processes an input sentence incrementally. At each stage, the incoming character is combined with existing partial candidates in all possible ways to generate new partial candidates. An agenda is used to control the search space, keeping only the B best partial candidates ending with the current character. The algorithm is simple and efficient, with a linear time complexity of O(BT n), where n is the size of input sentence, and T is the size of the tag set (T = 1 for pure word segmentation). It worked well for word segmentation alone (Zhang and Clark, 2007), even with an agenda size as small as 8, and a simple beam search algorithm also works well for POS tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996). However, when applied to the joint model, it resulted in a reduction in segmentation accuracy (compared to the baseline segmentor) even with B as large as 1024.","One possible cause of the poor performance of the standard beam search method is the combined nature of the candidates in the search space.

However, for the joint problem, candidates in the beam are segmented and tagged sequences up to the current character, where the last word can be a complete word or a partial word. A problem arises in whether to give POS tags to incomplete words. If partial words are given POS tags, it is likely that some partial words are “justified” as complete words by the current POS information. On the other hand, if partial words are not given POS tag features, the correct segmentation for long words can be lost during partial candidate comparison (since many short completed words with POS tags are likely to be preferred to a long incomplete word with no POS tag features).2","2","We experimented with both assigning POS features to partial words and omitting them; the latter method performed better but both performed significantly worse than the multiple beam search method described below. 891","Another possible cause is the exponential growth in the number of possible candidates with increasing sentence size. The number increases from O(T n",") for the baseline POS tagger to O(2n−1","T n",") for the joint system. As a result, for an incremental decoding algorithm, the number of possible candidates increases exponentially with the current word or character index. In the POS tagging problem, a new incoming word enlarges the number of possible candidates by a factor of T (the size of the tag set). For the joint problem, however, the enlarging factor becomes 2T with each incoming character. The speed of search space expansion is much faster, but the number of candidates is still controlled by a single, fixed-size beam at any stage. If we assume that the beam is not large enough for all the candidates at at each stage, then, from the newly generated candidates, the baseline POS tagger can keep 1/T for the next processing stage, while the joint model can keep only 1/2T , and has to discard the rest. Therefore, even when the candidate comparison standard is ignored, we can still see that the chance for the overall best candidate to fall out of the beam is largely increased. Since the search space growth is exponential, increasing the fixed beam size is not effective in solving the problem.","To solve the above problems, we developed a multiple beam search algorithm, which compares candidates only with complete tagged words, and enables the size of the search space to scale with the input size. The algorithm is shown in Figure 2. In this decoder, an agenda is assigned to each character in the input sentence, recording the B best segmented and tagged partial candidates ending with the character. The input sentence is still processed incrementally. However, now when a character is processed, existing partial candidates ending with any previous characters are available. Therefore, the decoder enumerates all possible tagged words ending with the current character, and combines each word with the partial candidates ending with its previous character. All input characters are processed in the same way, and the final output is the best candidate in the final agenda. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(W T Bn), with W being the maximum word size, T being the total number of POS tags and n the number of characters in the input. It is also linear in the input size. Moreover, the decoding algorithm gives competent accuracy with a small agenda size of B = 16.","To further limit the search space, two optimizations are used. First, the maximum word length for each tag is recorded and used by the decoder to prune unlikely candidates. Because the majority of tags only apply to words with length 1 or 2, this method has a strong effect. Development tests showed that it improves the speed significantly, while having a very small negative influence on the accuracy. Second, like the baseline POS tagger, the tag dictionary is used for Chinese closed set tags and the tags for frequent words. To words outside the tag dictionary, the decoder still tries to assign every possible tag. 3.3 Online learning Apart from features, the decoder maintains other types of information, including the tag dictionary, the word frequency counts used when building the tag dictionary, the maximum word lengths by tag, and the character categories. The above data can be collected by scanning the corpus before training starts. However, in both the baseline tagger and the joint POS tagger, they are updated incrementally during the perceptron training process, consistent with online learning.3","The online updating of word frequencies, maximum word lengths and character categories is straightforward. For the online updating of the tag dictionary, however, the decision for frequent words must be made dynamically because the word frequencies keep changing. This is done by caching the number of occurrences of the current most frequent word M , and taking all words currently above the threshold M/5000 + 5 as frequent words. 5000 is a rough figure to control the number of frequent words, set according to Zipf’s law. The parameter 5 is used to force all tags to be enumerated before a word is seen more than 5 times."]},{"title":"4 Related Work","paragraphs":["Ng and Low (2004) and Shi and Wang (2007) were described in the Introduction.

Here we consider the special character category features and the effect of the tag dictionary. The character category features (templates 15 and 16 in Table 2) represent a Chinese character by all the tags associated with the character in the training data. They have been shown to improve the accuracy of a Chinese POS tagger (Tseng et al., 2005). In the joint model, these features also represent segmentation information, since they concern the starting and ending characters of a word. Development tests showed that the overall tagging F-score of the joint model increased from 84.54% to 84.93% using the character category features. In the development test, the use of the tag dictionary improves the decoding speed of the joint model, reducing the decoding time from 416 seconds to 256 seconds. The overall tagging accuracy also increased slightly, consistent with observations from the pure POS tagger.","The error analysis for the development test is shown in Table 3.
