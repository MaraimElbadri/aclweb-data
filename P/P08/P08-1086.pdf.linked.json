They have often been shown to improve the performance of speech recognition systems when combined with word-based language models (Martin et al., 1998; Whittaker and Woodland, 2001). However, in the area of statistical machine translation, especially in the context of large training corpora, fewer experiments with class-based n-gram models have been performed with mixed success (Raab, 2006).","Class-based n-gram models have also been shown to benefit from their reduced number of parameters when scaling to higher-order n-grams (Goodman and Gao, 2000), and even despite the increasing size and decreasing sparsity of language model training corpora (Brants et al., 2007), class-based n-gram models might lead to improvements when increasing the n-gram order.","When training class-based n-gram models on large corpora and large vocabularies, one of the problems arising is the scalability of the typical clustering algorithms used for obtaining the word classification.

In addition, the size of the model is usually greatly reduced. 2.1 One-Sided Class-Based Models Two-sided class-based models received most atten-tion in the literature. However, several different types of mixed word and class models have been proposed for the purpose of improving the performance of the model (Goodman, 2000), reducing its size (Goodman and Gao, 2000) as well as lower-ing the complexity of related clustering algorithms (Whittaker and Woodland, 2001).","In (Emami and Jelinek, 2005) a clustering algorithm is introduced which outputs a separate clustering for each word position in a trigram model. In the experimental evaluation, the authors observe the largest improvements using a specific clustering for the last word of each trigram but no clustering at all for the first two word positions.

Beginning with an initial clustering, the algorithm greedily maximizes the log likelihood of a two-sided class bigram or trigram model as described in Eq. (1) on the training data. Let V be the set of words in the vocabulary and C the set of classes. This then leads to the following optimization criterion, where N (w) and N (c) denote the number of occurrences of a word w or a class c in the training data and N (c, d) denotes the number of occurrences of some word in class c followed by a word in class d in the training data:","Ĉ = argmax C ∑ w∈V N (w) · log N (w) + + ∑ c∈C,d∈C N (c, d) · log N (c, d) − −2 · ∑ c∈C N (c) · log N (c) (3)","The algorithm iterates over all words in the vocabulary and tentatively moves each word to each cluster. The change in the optimization criterion is computed for each of these tentative moves and the exchange leading to the highest increase in the optimization criterion (3) is performed. This procedure is then repeated until the algorithm reaches a local optimum.","To be able to efficiently calculate the changes in the optimization criterion when exchanging a word, the counts in Eq. (3) are computed once for the initial clustering, stored, and afterwards updated when a word is exchanged.","Often only a limited number of iterations are performed, as letting the algorithm terminate in a local optimum can be computationally impractical. 3.1 Complexity The implementation described in (Martin et al., 1998) uses a memory saving technique introducing a binary search into the complexity estimation. For the sake of simplicity, we omit this detail in the following complexity analysis. We also do not employ this optimization in our implementation.","The worst case complexity of the exchange algorithm is quadratic in the number of classes.

(2), for which the maximum-likelihood probability estimates for the n-grams are given by their relative frequencies:","P (wi|wi−1","1 ) ≈ p0(wi|c(wi)) · p1(c(wi)|wi−1)(4) = N (wi) N (c(wi)) ·","N (wi−1, c(wi)) N (wi−1) (5) where N (w) again denotes the number of occurrences of the word w in the training corpus and N (v, c) the number of occurrences of the word v followed by some word in class c. Then the following optimization criterion can be derived, with F (C) being the log likelihood function of the predictive class bigram model given a clustering C: F (C) = ∑ w∈V N (w) · log p(w|c(w)) + ∑ v∈V,c∈C N (v, c) · log p(c|v) (6) = ∑ w∈V N (w) · log N (w) N (c(w)) + ∑ v∈V,c∈C N (v, c) · log N (v, c) N (v) (7) = ∑ w∈V N (w) · log N (w) − ∑ w∈V N (w) · log N (c(w)) + ∑ v∈V,c∈C N (v, c) · log N (v, c) − ∑ v∈V,c∈C N (v, c) · log N (v) (8) The very last summation of Eq.

The first difference is that in contrast to the exchange algorithm using a two sided class-based bigram model in its optimization criterion, only two clusters are affected by moving a word.

The second difference is that B dominates the term B + Nv for most corpora and scales far less than linearly with the vocabulary size, providing a significant performance advantage over the other optimization criterion, especially when large vocabularies are used (Whittaker and Woodland, 2001).","For efficiency reasons, an exchange of a word between two clusters is separated into a remove and a move procedure.

The vocabulary is randomly partitioned into sets of roughly equal size. With each word w in one of these sets, all words v preceding w in the corpus are stored with the respective bigram count N (v, w).","The clusterings generated in each iteration as well as the initial clustering are stored as the set of words in each cluster, the total number of occurrences of each cluster in the training corpus, and the list of words preceeding each cluster. For each word w in the predecessor list of a given cluster c, the number of times w occurs in the training corpus before any word in c, N (w, c), is also stored.","Together with the counts stored with the vocabulary partitions, this allows for efficient updating of the terms in Eq. (10).","The initial clustering together with all the required counts is created in an initial iteration by assigning the n-th most frequent word to cluster n mod Nc. While (Martin et al., 1998) and (Emami and Jelinek, 2005) observe that the initial clustering does not seem to have a noticeable effect on the quality of the resulting clustering or the convergence rate, the intuition behind this method of initialization is that it is unlikely for the most frequent words to be clustered together due to their high numbers of occurrences.","In each subsequent iteration each one of a number of workers is assigned one of the partitions of the words in the vocabulary. After loading the current clustering, it then randomly chooses a subset of these words of a fixed size. For each of the selected words the worker then determines to which cluster the word is to be moved in order to maximize the increase in log likelihood, using the count updating procedures described in the previous sec-tion. All changes a worker makes to the clustering are accumulated locally in delta data structures. At the end of the iteration all deltas are merged and applied to the previous clustering, resulting in the complete clustering loaded in the next iteration.","This algorithm fits well into the MapReduce programming model (Dean and Ghemawat, 2004) that we used for our implementation. 5.1 Convergence While the greedy non-distributed exchange algorithm is guaranteed to converge as each exchange increases the log likelihood of the assumed bigram model, this is not necessarily true for the distributed exchange algorithm. This stems from the fact that the change in log likelihood is calculated by each worker under the assumption that no other changes to the clustering are performed by other workers in"]},{"title":"758","paragraphs":["this iteration. However, if in each iteration only a rather small and randomly chosen subset of all words are considered for exchange, the intuition is that the remaining words still define the parameters of each cluster well enough for the algorithm to converge.","In (Emami and Jelinek, 2005) the authors observe that only considering a subset of the vocabulary of half the size of the complete vocabulary in each iteration does not affect the time required by the exchange algorithm to converge. Yet each iteration is sped up by approximately a factor of two. The quality of class-based models trained using the resulting clusterings did not differ noticeably from those trained using clusterings for which the full vocabulary was considered in each iteration. Our experiments showed that this also seems to be the case for the distributed exchange algorithm. While considering very large subsets of the vocabulary in each iteration can cause the algorithm to not converge at all, considering only a very small fraction of the words for exchange will increase the number of iterations required to converge. In experiments we empirically determined that choosing a subset of roughly a third of the size of the full vocabulary is a good balance in this trade-off. We did not observe the algorithm to not converge unless we used fractions above half of the vocabulary size.","We typically ran the clustering for 20 to 30 iterations after which the number of words exchanged in each iteration starts to stabilize at less than 5 percent of the vocabulary size. Figure 1 shows the number of words exchanged in each of 34 iterations when clustering the approximately 300,000 word vocabulary of the Arabic side of the English-Arabic parallel training data into 512 and 2,048 clusters.","Despite a steady reduction in the number of words exchanged per iteration, we observed the convergence in regards to log-likelihood to be far from monotone. In our experiments we were able to achieve significantly more monotone and faster convergence by employing the following heuristic. As described in Section 5, we start out the first iteration with a random partition of the vocabulary into subsets each assigned to a specific worker. However, instead of keeping this assignment constant through-out all iterations, after each iteration the vocabulary is partitioned anew so that all words from any given cluster are considered by the same worker in the next iteration. The intuition behind this heuristic is that as the clustering becomes more coherent, the information each worker has about groups of similar words is becoming increasingly accurate. In our experiments this heuristic lead to almost monotone convergence in log-likelihood. It also reduced the 0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 60000 70000 80000 90000 100000 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 words exchanged iteration 512 clusters 2048 clusters Figure 1: Number of words exchanged per iteration when clustering the vocabulary of the Arabic side of the English-Arabic parallel training data (347 million tokens). number of iterations required to converge by up to a factor of three. 5.2 Resource Requirements The runtime of the distributed exchange algorithm depends highly on the number of distinct bigrams in the training corpus. When clustering the approximately 1.5 million word vocabulary of a 405 million token English corpus into 1,000 clusters, one iteration takes approximately 5 minutes using 50 workers based on standard hardware running the Linux operating system. When clustering the 0.5 million most frequent words in the vocabulary of an English corpus with 31 billion tokens into 1,000 clusters, one iteration takes approximately 30 minutes on 200 workers.","When scaling up the vocabulary and corpus sizes, the current bottleneck of our implementation is loading the current clustering into memory. While the memory requirements decrease with each iteration, during the first few iterations a worker typically still needs approximately 2 GB of memory to load the clustering generated in the previous iteration when training 1,000 clusters on the 31 billion token corpus."]},{"title":"6 Experiments","paragraphs":["We trained a number of predictive class-based language models on different Arabic and English corpora using clusterings trained on the complete data of the same corpus.
