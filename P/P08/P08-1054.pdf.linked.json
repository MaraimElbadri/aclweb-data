Toronto M5S 3G4 CANADA gpenn,xzhu @cs.toronto.edu Abstract","paragraphs":["We assess the current state of the art in speech summarization, by comparing a typical summarizer on two different domains: lecture data and the SWITCHBOARD corpus. Our results cast significantdoubt on the merits of this area’s accepted evaluation standards in terms of: baselines chosen, the correspondence of results to our intuition of what “summaries” should be, and the value of adding speech-related features to summarizers that already use transcripts from automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems."]},{"title":"1 Problem definitionand related literature","paragraphs":["Speech is arguably the most basic, most natural form of human communication. The consistent demand for and increasing availability of spoken audio content on web pages and other digital media should therefore come as no surprise. Along with this availability comes a demand for ways to better navigate through speech, which is inherently more linear or sequential than text in its traditional delivery.","Navigation connotes a number of specific tasks, including search, but also browsing (Hirschberg et al., 1999) and skimming, which can involve far more analysis and manipulation of content than the spoken document retrieval tasks of recent NIST fame (1997 2000). These would include time compression of the speech signal and/or “dichotic” presentations of speech, in which a different audio track is presented to either ear (Cherry and Taylor, 1954; Ranjan et al., 2006). Time compression of speech, on the other hand, excises small slices of digitized speech data out of the signal so that the voices speak all of the content but more quickly. The excision can either be fixed rate, for which there have been a number of experiments to detect comprehension limits, or variable rate, where the rate is determined by pause detection and shortening (Arons, 1992), pitch (Arons, 1994) or longer-term measures of linguistic salience (Tucker and Whittaker, 2006). A very short-term measure based on spectral entropy can also be used (Ajmal et al., 2007), which has the advantage that listeners cannot detect the variation in rate, but they nevertheless comprehend better than fixed-rate baselines that preserve pitch periods. With or without variable rates, listeners can easily withstand a factor of two speed-up, but Likert response tests definitively show that they absolutely hate doing it (Tucker and Whittaker, 2006) relative to word-level or utterance-level excisive methods, which would include the summarization-based strategy that we pursue in this paper.","The strategy we focus on here is summarization, in its more familiar construal from computational linguistics and information retrieval. We view it as an extension of the text summarization problem in which we use automatically prepared, imperfect textual transcripts to summarize speech. Other details are provided in Section 2.2. Early work on speech summarization was either domain-restricted (Kameyama and Arima, 1994), or prided itself on not using ASR at all, because of its unreliability in open domains (Chen and Withgott, 1992). Summaries of speech, however, can still be delivered audially (Kikuchi et al., 2003), even when (noisy) transcripts are used. 470","The purpose of this paper is not so much to in-troduce a new way of summarizing speech, as to critically reappraise how well the current state of the art really works. The earliest work to consider open-domain speech summarization seriously from the standpoint of text summarization technology (Valenza et al., 1999; Zechner and Waibel, 2000) approached the task as one of speech transcription followed by text summarization of the resulting transcript (weighted by confidence scores from the ASR system), with the very interesting result that transcription and summarization errors in such systems tend to offset one another in overall performance. In the years following this work, however, some research by others on speech summarization (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2005; Murray et al., 2005; Murray et al., 2006, inter alia) has focussed de rigueur on striving for and measuring the improvements attainable over the transcribe-then-summarize baseline with features available from non-transcriptional sources (e.g., pitch and energy of the acoustic signal) or those, while evident in textual transcripts, not germane to texts other than spoken language transcripts (e.g., speaker changes or question-answer pair boundaries).","These “no vel” features do indeed seem to help, but not by nearly as much as some of this recent literature would suggest. The experiments and the choice of baselines have largely been framed to illuminate the value of various knowledge sources (“prosodic features,” “named entity features” etc.), rather than to optimize performance per se — although the large-dimensional pattern recognition algorithms and classifiersthat they use are inappropriate for descriptive hypothesis testing.","First, most of the benefit attained by these novel sources can be captured simply by measuring the lengths of candidate utterances. Only one paper we are aware of (Christensen et al., 2004) has presented the performance of length on its own, although the objective there was to use length, position and other simple textual feature baselines (no acoustics) to distinguish the properties of various genres of spoken audio content, a topic that we will return to in Section 2.1.1","Second, maximal marginal relevance 1 Length features are often mentioned in the text of other","work as the most beneficial single features in more hetero- (MMR) has also fallen by the wayside, although it too performs very well. Again, only one paper that we are aware of (Murray et al., 2005) provides an MMR baseline, and there MMR significantly out-performs an approach trained on a richer collection of features, including acoustic features. MMR was the method of choice for utterance selection in Zechner and Waibel (2000) and their later work, but it is often eschewed perhaps because textbook MMR does not directly provide a means to incorporate other features. There is a simple means of doing so (Section 2.3), and it is furthermore very resilient to low word-error rates (WERs, Section 3.3).","Third, as inappropriate uses of optimization methods go, the one comparison that has not made it into print yet is that of the more traditional “what-is-said” features (MMR, length in words and named-entity features) vs. the avant-garde “ho w-it-is-said” features (structural, acoustic/prosodic and spoken-language features). Maskey & Hirschberg (2005) divide their features into these categories, but only to compute a correlation coefficient between them (0.74). The former in aggregate still performs significantly better than the latter in aggregate, even if certain members of the latter do outperform certain members of the former. This is perhaps the most reassuring comparison we can offer to text summarization and ASR enthusiasts, because it corroborates the important role that ASR still plays in speech summarization in spite of its imperfections.","Finally, and perhaps most disconcertingly, we can show that current speech summarization performs just as well, and in some respects even better, with SWITCHBOARD dialogues as it does with more coherent spoken-language content, such as lectures. This is not a failing of automated systems themselves — even humans exhibit the same tendency under the experimental conditions that most researchers have used to prepare evaluation gold standards. What this means is that, while speech summarization systems may arguably be useful and are indeed consistent with whatever it is that humans are doing when they are enlisted to rank utterances, this evaluation regime simply does not reflect how well the “summaries” capture the goal-orientation or geneous systems, but without indicating their performance on their own. 471 higher-level purpose of the data that they are trained on. As a community, we have been optimizing an utterance excerpting task, we have been moderately successful at it, but this task in at least one important respect bears no resemblance to what we could convincingly call speech summarization.","These four results provide us with valuable insight into the current state of the art in speech summarization: it is not summarization, the aspiration to measure the relative merits of knowledge sources has masked the prominence of some very simple baselines, and the Zechner & Waibel pipe-ASR-output-into-text-summarizer model is still very competitive — what seems to matter more than having access to the raw spoken data is simply knowing that it is spoken data, so that the most relevant, still textually available features can be used. Section 2 describes the background and further details of the experiments that we conducted to arrive at these conclusions. Section 3 presents the results that we obtained. Section 4 concludes by outlining an ecologically valid alternative for evaluating real summarization in light of these results."]},{"title":"2 Setting of the experiment 2.1 Provenance of the data","paragraphs":["Speech summarizers are generally trained to summarize either broadcast news or meetings. With the exception of one paper that aspires to compare the “styles” of spoken and written language ceteris paribus (Christensen et al., 2004), the choice of broadcast news as a source of data in more recent work is rather curious. Broadcast news, while open in principle in its range of topics, typically has a range of closely parallel, written sources on those same topics, which can either be substituted for spoken source material outright, or at the very least be used corroboratively alongside them. Broadcast news is also read by professional news readers, using high quality microphones and studio equipment, and as a result has very lower WER — some even call ASR a solved problem on this data source. Broadcast news is also very text-like at a deeper level. Relative position within a news story or dialogue, the dreaded baseline of text summarization, works ex-tremely well in spoken broadcast news summarization, too. Within the operating region of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve most relevant to summarizers (0.1–0.3), Christensen et al. (2004) showed that position was by far the best feature in a read broadcast news system with high WER, and that position and length of the extracted utterance were the two best with low WER. Christensen et al. (2004) also distinguished read news from “spontaneous news,” broadcasts that contain interviews and/or man-in-the-field reports, and showed that in the latter variety position is not at all prominent at any level of WER, but length is. Maskey & Hirschberg’s (2005) broadcast news is a combina-tion of read news and spontaneous news.","Spontaneous speech, in our view, particularly in the lecture domain, is our best representative of what needs to be summarized. Here, the positional baseline performs quite poorly (although length does ex-tremely well, as discussed below), and ASR performance is far from perfect. In the case of lectures, there are rarely exact transcripts available, but there are bulleted lines from presentation slides, related research papers on the speaker’s web page and monographs on the same topic that can be used to improve the language models for speech recognition systems. Lectures have just the right amount of props for realistic ASR, but still very open domain vocabularies and enough spontaneity to make this a problem worth solving. As discussed further in Section 4, the classroom lecture genre also provides us with a task that we hope to use to conduct a better grounded evaluation of real summarization quality.","To this end, we use a corpus of lectures recorded at the University of Toronto to train and test our summarizer. Only the lecturer is recorded, using a headworn microphone, and each lecture lasts 50 minutes. The lectures in our experiments are all undergraduate computer science lectures. The results reported in this paper used four different lectures, each from a different course and spoken by a different lecturer. We used a leave-one-out cross-validation approach by iteratively training on three lectures worth of material and testing on the one remaining. We combine these iterations by averaging. The lectures were divided at random into 8–15 minute intervals, however, in order to provide a better comparison with the SWITCHBOARD dialogues. Each interval was treated as a separate document and was summarized separately. So the four lectures together actually 472 provide 16 SWITCHBOARD-sized samples of material, and our cross-validation leaves on average four of them out in a turn.","We also use part of the SWITCHBOARD corpus in one of our comparisons. SWITCHBOARD is a collection of telephone conversations, in which two participants have been told to speak on a certain topic, but with no objective or constructive goal to proceed towards. While the conversations are locally coherent, this lack of goal-orientation is acutely apparent in all of them — they may be as close as any speech recording can come to being about nothing.2","We randomly selected 27 conversations, containing a total of 3665 utterances (identified by pause length), and had three human annotators manually label each utterance as in- or out-of-summary. Interestingly, the interannotator agreement on SWITCHBOARD ( ",") is higher than on the lecture corpus (0.372) and higher than the","-score reported by Galley (2006) for the ICSI meeting data used by Murray et al. (2005; 2006), in spite of the fact that Murray et al. (2005) primed their annotators with a set of questions to consider when annotating the data.3","This does not mean that the SWITCHBOARD summaries are qualitatively better, but rather that annotators are apt to agree more on which utterances to include in them. 2.2 Summarization task As with most work in speech summarization, our strategy involves considering the problem as one of utterance extraction, which means that we are not synthesizing new text or speech to include in summaries, nor are we attempting to extract small phrases to sew together with new prosodic contours. Candidate utterances are identified through pause-length detection, and the length of these pauses has been experimentally calibrated to 200 msec, which results in roughly sentence-sized utterances. Summarization then consists of choosing the best N% of these utterances for the summary, where N is typ-","2","It should be noted that the meandering style of SWITCHBOARD conversations does have correlates in text processing, particularly in the genres of web blogs and newsgroup- or wiki-based technical discussions.","3","Although we did definewhat a summary was to each annotator beforehand, we did not provide questions or suggestions on content for either corpus. ically between 10 and 30. We will provide ROC curves to indicate performance as a function over all N. An ROC is plotted along an x-axis of specificity (true-negative-rate) and a y-axis of sensitivity (truepositive-rate). A larger area under the ROC corresponds to better performance. 2.3 Utterance isolation The framework for our extractive summarization experiments is depicted in Figure 1. With the exception of disfluenc y removal, it is very similar in its overall structure to that of Zechner’s (2001). The summarizer takes as input either manual or automatic transcripts together with an audio file, and has three modules to process disfluencies and extract features important to identifying sentences. Figure 1: Experimental framework for summarizing spontaneous conversations.","During sentence boundary detection, words that are likely to be adjacent to an utterance boundary are determined. We call these words trigger words.","False starts are very common in spontaneous speech. According to Zechner’s (2001) statistics on the SWITCHBOARD corpus, they occur in 10-15% of all utterances. A decision tree (C4.5, Release 8) is used to detect false starts, trained on the POS tags and trigger-word status of the firstand last four words of sentences from a training set. Once false starts are detected, these are removed.","We also identify repetitions as a sequence of between 1 and 4 words which is consecutively re-473 peated in spontaneous speech. Generally, repetitions are discarded. Repetitions of greater length are ex-tremely rare statistically and are therefore ignored.","Question-answer pairs are also detected and linked. Question-answer detection is a two-stage process. The system firstidentifiesthe questions and then findsthe corresponding answer. For (both WH-and Yes/No) question identification, another C4.5 classifier was trained on 2,000 manually annotated sentences using utterance length, POS bigram occurrences, and the POS tags and trigger-word status of the firstand last five words of an utterance. After a question is identified, the immediately following sentence is labelled as the answer. 2.4 Utterance selection To obtain a trainable utterance selection module that can utilize and compare rich features, we formulated utterance selection as a standard binary classification problem, and experimented with several state-of-the-art classifiers, including linear discriminant analysis LDA, support vector machines with a radial basis kernel (SVM), and logistic regression (LR), as shown in Figure 2 (computed on SWITCHBOARD data). MMR, Zechner’s (2001) choice, is provided as a baseline. MMR linearly interpolates a relevance component and a redundancy component that balances the need for new vs. salient information. These two components can just as well be mixed through LR, which admits the possibility of adding more features and the benefitof using LR over held-out estimation. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 10 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Recall Precision   LR−full−fea LDA−full−fea SVM−full−fea LR−MMR−fea MMR Figure 2: Precision-recall curve for several classifierson the utterance selection task.","As Figure 2 indicates, there is essentially no difference in performance among the three classifiers we tried, nor between MMR and LR restricted to the two MMR components. This is important, since we will be comparing MMR to LR-trained classifiersbased on other combinations of features below. The ROC curves in the remainder of this paper have been prepared using the LR classifier. 2.5 Features extracted While there is very little difference realized across pattern recognition methods, there is much more at stake with respect to which features the methods use to characterize their input. We can extract and use the features in Figure 3, arranged there according to their knowledge source.","We detect disfluencies in the same manner as Zechner (2001)). Taking ASR transcripts as input, we use the Brill tagger (Brill, 1995) to assign POS tags to each word. There are 42 tags: Brill’s 38 plus four which identify filled-pausedisfluencies:"," empty coordinating conjunctions (CO),"," lexicalized filledpauses (DM),"," editing terms (ET), and"," non-lexicalized filledpauses (UH). Our disfluenc y features include the number of each of these, their total, and also the number of repetitions. Disfluencies adjacent to a speaker turn are ignored, however, because they occur as a normal part of turn coordination between speakers.","Our preliminary experiments suggest that speaker meta-data do not improve on the quality of summarization, and so this feature is not included.","We indicate with bold type the features that indicate some quantity of length, and we will consider these as members of another class called “length, ” in addition to their given class above. In all of the data on which we have measured, the correlation between time duration and number of words is nearly 1.00 (although pause length is not). 2.6 Evaluation of summary quality We plot receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves along a range of possible compression parameters, and in one case, ROUGE scores.

As is evident, there is very little difference among the combinations of features with this data source, apart from the positional baseline, “lead, ” which simply chooses the first N% of the utterances. This performs quite poorly. The best performance is achieved by using all of the features together, but the length baseline, which uses only those features in bold type from Figure 3, is very close (no statistically significant difference), as is MMR.6","4","When evaluated on its own, the MMR interpolating parameter is set through experimentation on a held-out dataset, as in Zechner (2001). When combined with other features, its relevance and redundancy components are provided to the classifier separately.","5","All of these features are calculated on the word level and normalized by speaker.","6","We conducted the same evaluation without splitting the lectures into 8–15 minute segments (so that the summaries summarize an entire lecture), and although space here precludes the presentation of the ROC curves, they are nearly identical Figure 4: ROC curve for utterance selection with the lecture corpus with several feature combinations. 3.2 SWITCHBOARD corpus The corresponding results on SWITCHBOARD are shown in Figure 5. Again, length and MMR are very close to the best alternative, which is again all of features combined. The difference with respect to either of these baselines is statistically significant within the popular 10–30% compression range, as is the classifier trained on all features but acoustic to those on the segments shown here. 475 Figure 5: ROC curve for SWITCHBOARD utterance selection with several feature combinations. (not shown). The classifier trained on all features but spoken language features (not shown) is not significantly better, so it is the spoken language features that make the difference, not the acoustic features. The best score is also significantlybetter than on the lecture data, however, particularly in the 10– 30% range. Our analysis of the difference suggests that the much greater variance in utterance length in SWITCHBOARD is what accounts for the overall better performance of the automated system as well as the higher human interannotator agreement. This also goes a long way to explaining why the length baseline is so good.","Still another perspective is to classify features as either “what-is-said” (MMR, length and NE features) or “ho w-it-is-said” (structural, acoustic and spoken-language features), as shown in Figure 6. What-is-said features are better, but only barely so within the usual operating region of summarizers. 3.3 Impact of WER Word error rates (WERs) arising from speech recognition are usually much higher in spontaneous conversations than in read news. Having trained ASR models on SWITCHBOARD section 2 data with our sample of 27 conversations removed, the WER on that sample is 46%. We then train a language model on SWITCHBOARD section 2 without removing the 27-conversation sample so as to delib-0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 10 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Sensitivity 1−Specificity   all what−is−said how−it−is−said Figure 6: ROC curves for textual and non-textual features. erately overfitthe model. This pseudo-WER is then 39%. We might be able to get less WER by tuning the ASR models or by using more training data, but that is not the focus here. Summarizing the automatic transcripts generated from both of these systems using our LR-based classifierwith all features, as well as manual (perfect) transcripts, we obtain the ROUGE–1 scores in Table 1.

One reason is that the acoustic and structural features are not affected by word errors, although WERs can affect the MMR, spoken language, length and NE features. Figures 7 and 8 present the ROC curves of the MMR and spoken language features, respectively, under different WERs. MMR is particularly resilient, even on SWITCHBOARD. Keywords are still often correctly recognized, even in the presence of high WER, although possibly because the same topic is discussed in many SWITCHBOARD conversations. 476 Figure 7: ROC curves for the effectiveness of MMR scores on transcripts under different WERs. Figure 8: ROC curves for the effectiveness of spoken language features on transcripts under different WERs. When some keywords are misrecognized (e.g. hat), furthermore, related words (e.g. dress, wear) still may identify important utterances. As a result, a high WER does not necessarily mean a worse transcript for bag-of-keywords applications like summarization and classification, regardless of the data source. Utterance length does not change very much when WERs vary, and in addition, it is often a latent variable that underlies some other features’ role, e.g., a long utterance often has a higher MMR score than a short utterance, even when the WER changes.","Note that the effectiveness of spoken language features varies most between manually and automatically generated transcripts just at around the typical operating region of most summarization systems. The features of this category that respond most to WER are disfluencies. Disfluenc y detection is also at its most effective in this same range with respect to any transcription method."]},{"title":"4 Future Work","paragraphs":["In terms of future work in light of these results, clearly the most important challenge is to formulate an experimental alternative to measuring against a subjectively classified gold standard in which annotators are forced to commit to relative salience judgements with no attention to goal orientation and no requirement to synthesize the meanings of larger units of structure into a coherent message. It is here that using the lecture domain offers us some addi-tional assistance. Once these data have been transcribed and outlined, we will be able to formulate examinations for students that test their knowledge of the topics being lectured upon: both their higher-level understanding of goals and conceptual themes, as well as factoid questions on particular details. A group of students can be provided with access to a collection of entire lectures to establish a theoretical limit. Experimental and control groups can then be provided with access only to summaries of those lectures, prepared using different sets of features, or different modes of delivery (text vs. speech), for example. This task-based protocol involves quite a bit more work, and at our university, at least, there are regulations that preclude us placing a group of students in a class at a disadvantage with respect to an examination for credit that need to be dealt with. It is, however, a far better means of assessing the quality of summaries in an ecologically valid context.","It is entirely possible that, within this protocol, the baselines that have performed so well in our experiments, such as length or, in read news, position, will utterly fail, and that less traditional acoustic or spoken language features will genuinely, and with statistical significance,add value to a purely transcript-based text summarization system. To date, however, that case has not been made. He et al. (1999) conducted a study very similar to the one suggested above and found no significant difference between using pitch and using slide transition boundaries. No ASR transcripts or length features were used. 477"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["M. Ajmal, A. Kushki, and K. N. Plataniotis. 2007.
