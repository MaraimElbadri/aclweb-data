In some language pairs, i.e. Chinese-to-English translation, state-of-the-art hierarchical systems show significant advantage over phrasal systems in MT accuracy. For example, Chiang (2007) showed that the Hiero system achieved about 1 to 3 point improvement in BLEU on the NIST 03/04/05 Chinese-English evaluation sets compared to a start-of-the-art phrasal system.","Our work extends the hierarchical MT approach. We propose a string-to-dependency model for MT, which employs rules that represent the source side as strings and the target side as dependency structures. We restrict the target side to the so called well-formed dependency structures, in order to cover a large set of non-constituent transfer rules (Marcu et al., 2006), and enable efficientdecoding through dynamic programming. We incorporate a dependency language model during decoding, in order to exploit long-distance word relations which are unavailable with a traditional n-gram language model on target strings.","For comparison purposes, we replicated the Hiero decoder (Chiang, 2005) as our baseline. Our string-to-dependency decoder shows 1.48 point improvement in BLEU and 2.53 point improvement in TER on the NIST 04 Chinese-English MT evaluation set.","In the rest of this section, we will briefly discuss previous work on hierarchical MT and dependency representations, which motivated our research. In section 2, we introduce the model of string-to-dependency decoding. Section 3 illustrates of the use of dependency language models. In section 4, we describe the implementation details of our MT system. We discuss experimental results in section 5, compare to related work in section 6, and draw conclusions in section 7. 1.1 Hierarchical Machine Translation Graehl and Knight (2004) proposed the use of target-tree-to-source-string transducers (xRS) to model translation. In xRS rules, the right-hand-side(rhs) of the target side is a tree with non-terminals(NTs), while the rhs of the source side is a string with NTs. Galley et al. (2006) extended this string-to-tree model by using Context-Free parse trees to represent the target side. A tree could represent multi-level transfer rules.","The Hiero decoder (Chiang, 2007) does not require explicit syntactic representation on either side of the rules. Both source and target are strings with NTs. Decoding is solved as chart parsing. Hiero can be viewed as a hierarchical string-to-string model.","Ding and Palmer (2005) and Quirk et al. (2005) 577 itwill find boy the interesting Figure 1: The dependency tree for sentence the boy will find it interesting followed the tree-to-tree approach (Shieber and Schabes, 1990) for translation. In their models, dependency treelets are used to represent both the source and the target sides. Decoding is implemented as tree transduction preceded by source side dependency parsing. While tree-to-tree models can represent richer structural information, existing tree-to-tree models did not show advantage over string-to-tree models on translation accuracy due to a much larger search space.","One of the motivations of our work is to achieve desirable trade-off between model capability and search space through the use of the so called well-formed dependency structures in rule representation. 1.2 Dependency Trees Dependency trees reveal long-distance relations between words. For a given sentence, each word has a parent word which it depends on, except for the root word.","Figure 1 shows an example of a dependency tree. Arrows point from the child to the parent. In this example, the word find is the root.","Dependency trees are simpler in form than CFG trees since there are no constituent labels. However, dependency relations directly model semantic structure of a sentence. As such, dependency trees are a desirable prior model of the target sentence.","1.3 Motivations for Well-Formed Dependency Structures We restrict ourselves to the so-called well-formed target dependency structures based on the following considerations. Dynamic Programming","In (Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005), there is no restriction on dependency treelets used in transfer rules except for the size limit. This may result in a high dimensionality in hypothesis representation and make it hard to employ shared structures for efficientdynamic programming.","In (Galley et al., 2004), rules contain NT slots and combination is only allowed at those slots. Therefore, the search space becomes much smaller. Furthermore, shared structures can be easily defined based on the labels of the slots.","In order to take advantage of dynamic programming, we fixed the positions onto which another another tree could be attached by specifying NTs in dependency trees. Rule Coverage","Marcu et al. (2006) showed that many useful phrasal rules cannot be represented as hierarchical rules with the existing representation methods, even with composed transfer rules (Galley et al., 2006). For example, the following rule","• <(hong)Chinese, (DT(the) JJ(red))English> is not a valid string-to-tree transfer rule since the red is a partial constituent.","A number of techniques have been proposed to improve rule coverage. (Marcu et al., 2006) and (Galley et al., 2006) introduced artificialconstituent nodes dominating the phrase of interest. The binarization method used by Wang et al. (2007) can cover many non-constituent rules also, but not all of them. For example, it cannot handle the above example. DeNeefe et al. (2007) showed that the best results were obtained by combing these methods.","In this paper, we use well-formed dependency structures to handle the coverage of non-constituent rules. The use of dependency structures is due to the fle xibility of dependency trees as a representation method which does not rely on constituents (Fox, 2002; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005). The well-formedness of the dependency structures enables efficient decoding through dynamic programming."]},{"title":"2 String-to-Dependency Translation 2.1 Transfer Rules with Well-Formed Dependency Structures","paragraphs":["A string-to-dependency grammar G is a 4-tuple G =< R, X, Tf , Te >, where R is a set of transfer rules. X is the only non-terminal, which is similar to the Hiero system (Chiang, 2007). Tf is a set of 578 terminals in the source language, and Te is a set of terminals in the target language1",".","A string-to-dependency transfer rule R ∈ R is a 4-tuple R =< Sf , Se, D, A >, where Sf ∈ (Tf ∪ {X})+","is a source string, S","e ∈ (Te ∪ {X})+","is a target string, D represents the dependency structure for Se, and A is the alignment between Sf and Se. Non-terminal alignments in A must be one-to-one.","In order to exclude undesirable structures, we only allow Se whose dependency structure D is well-formed, which we will define below. In addi-tion, the same well-formedness requirement will be applied to partial decoding results. Thus, we will be able to employ shared structures to merge multiple partial results.","Based on the results in previous work (DeNeefe et al., 2007), we want to keep two kinds of dependency structures. In one kind, we keep dependency trees with a sub-root, where all the children of the sub-root are complete. We call them fixed dependency structures because the head is known or fixed. In the other, we keep dependency structures of sibling nodes of a common head, but the head itself is unspecifiedor floating. Each of the siblings must be a complete constituent. We call them floating dependency structures. Floating structures can represent many linguistically meaningful non-constituent structures: for example, like the red, a modifier of a noun. Only those two kinds of dependency structures are well-formed structures in our system.","Furthermore, we operate over well-formed structures in a bottom-up style in decoding. However, the description given above does not provide a clear definition on how to combine those two types of structures. In the rest of this section, we will provide formal definitionsof well-formed structures and combinatory operations over them, so that we can easily manipulate well-formed structures in decoding. Formal definitions also allow us to easily extend the framework to incorporate a dependency language model in decoding. Examples will be provided along with the formal definitions.","Consider a sentence S = w1w2...wn. Let d1d2...dn represent the parent word IDs for each word.

A category is composed of the three fields (A, h, B), where h is used to represent the head, and A and B are designed to model left and right dependents of the head respectively. A dependency structure is well-formed if and only if it is either fixed or floating . Examples","We can represent dependency structures with graphs. Figure 2 shows examples of fixed structures, Figure 3 shows examples of floating structures, and Figure 4 shows ill-formed dependency structures.","It is easy to verify that the structures in Figures 2 and 3 are well-formed. 4(a) is ill-formed because 579 interestingwill findfind boy (a) (b) Figure 4: Ill-formed dependency structures boy does not have its child word the in the tree. 4(b) is ill-formed because it is not a continuous segment.","As for the example the red mentioned above, it is a well-formed floating dependency structure.","2.2 Operations on Well-Formed Dependency Structures and Categories One of the purposes of introducing floating dependency structures is that siblings having a common parent will become a well-defined entity, although they are not considered a constituent. We always build well-formed partial structures on the target side in decoding. Furthermore, we combine partial dependency structures in a way such that we can obtain all possible well-formed but no ill-formed dependency structures during bottom-up decoding.","The solution is to employ categories introduced above. Each well-formed dependency structure has a category. We can apply four combinatory operations over the categories. If we can combine two categories with a certain category operation, we can use a corresponding tree operation to combine two dependency structures. The category of the combined dependency structure is the result of the combinatory category operations.","We firstintroduce three meta category operations. Two of them are unary operations, left raising (LR) and right raising (RR), and one is the binary operation unification(UF).","First, the raising operations are used to turn a completed fixed structure into a floating structure. It is easy to verify the following theorem according to the definitions. Theorem 1 A fixed structure with category (−, h, −) for span [i, j] is also a floating structure with children {h} if there are no outside words depending on word h. 8k =2 [i; j]; dk 6= h: (1) Therefore we can always raise a fixed structure if we assume it is complete, i.e. (1) holds. itwill find boy the interesting LA","LA LA RA RA LC RC Figure 5: A dependency tree with flexible combination Definition3 Meta Category Operations LR(( ; h; )) = (fhg; ; ) RR(( ; h; )) = ( ; ; fhg) UF((A1; h1; B1); (A2; h2; B2)) = NORM((A1 t","A2; h1 t h2; B1 t B2)) Unification is well-defined if and only if we can unify all three elements and the result is a valid fixed or floating category. For example, we can unify a fixed structure with a floating structure or two floating structures in the same direction, but we cannot unify two fixed structures. h1 t h2 =    h1 if h2 = h2 if h1 = undefined otherwise A1 t A2 =    A1 if A2 = A2 if A1 = A1 [ A2 otherwise NORM((A; h; B)) =    ( ; h; ) if h 6= (A; ; ) if h = ; B = ( ; ; B) if h = ; A = undefined otherwise","Next we introduce the four tree operations on dependency structures. Instead of providing the formal definition, we use figures to illustrate these operations to make it easy to understand. Figure 1 shows a traditional dependency tree. Figure 5 shows the four operations to combine partial dependency structures, which are left adjoining (LA), right adjoining (RA), left concatenation (LC) and right concatenation (RC).","Child and parent subtrees can be combined with adjoining which is similar to the traditional dependency formalism. We can either adjoin a fixed structure or a floating structure to the head of a fixed structure.","Complete siblings can be combined via concatenation.

Theorem 2 (soundness and completeness) Suppose X and Y are well-formed dependency structures. OP(cat(X), cat(Y )) is well-defined for a given operation OP if and only if OP(X, Y ) is well-defined. Furthermore, cat(OP(X; Y )) = OP(cat(X); cat(Y )) Suppose we have a dependency tree for a red apple, where both a and red depend on apple.

Corollary 1 (confluence) The category of a well-formed dependency tree does not depend on the order of category calculation.","With categories, we can easily track the types of dependency structures and constrain operations in decoding.

The procedure is similar to (Chiang, 2007) except that we maintain tree structures on the target side, instead of strings.","Given sentence-aligned bi-lingual training data, we first use GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to generate word level alignment. We use a statistical CFG parser to parse the English side of the training data, and extract dependency trees with Magerman’s rules (1995). Then we use heuristic rules to extract transfer rules recursively based on the GIZA alignment and the target dependency trees. The rule extraction procedure is as follows.","1. Initialization:","All the 4-tuples (P i,j f , P m,n","e , D, A) are valid phrase alignments, where source phrase P i,j f is 2 Here we use words instead of word indexes in categories to","make the example easy to understand. 581 it find interesting (D1) (D2) it X find","interesting (D’) Figure 7: Replacing it with X in D1 aligned to target phrase P m,n","e under alignment3 A, and D, the dependency structure for P m,n","e , is well-formed.

Inference: Let (P i,j f , P m,n","e , D1, A) be a valid rule tem-","plate, and (P","p,q","f , P s,t","e , D2, A) a valid phrase","alignment, where [p, q] ⊂ [i, j], [s, t] ⊂ [m, n],","D2 is a sub-structure of D1, and at least one","word in P i,j f but not in P","p,q","f is aligned.","We create a new valid rule template","(P ′","f , P ′","e, D′",", A), where we obtain P ′","f by replacing P p,q f with label X in P i,j f , and obtain P ′ e by replacing P s,t","e with X in P m,n","e . Furthermore, We obtain D′","by replacing sub-structure D2 with X in D14",". An example is shown in Figure 7.","Among all valid rule templates, we collect those","that contain at most two NTs and at most seven ele-","ments in the source as transfer rules in our system. 2.4 Decoding Following previous work on hierarchical MT (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006), we solve decoding as chart parsing. We view target dependency as the hidden structure of source fragments.","The parser scans all source cells in a bottom-up style, and checks matched transfer rules according to the source side. Once there is a completed rule, we build a larger dependency structure by substituting component dependency structures for corresponding NTs in the target dependency structure of rules.","Hypothesis dependency structures are organized in a shared forest, or AND-OR structures.

Since we only have a single NT X in the formalism described above, we do not need to add the NT label in states. However, we need to specify one of the three types of the dependency structure: fixed, floating on the left side, or floating on the right side. This information is encoded in the category of the dependency structure.","In the next section, we will explain how to extend categories and states to exploit a dependency language model during decoding."]},{"title":"3 Dependency Language Model","paragraphs":["For the dependency tree in Figure 1, we calculate the probability of the tree as follows","P rob = PT (f ind) PL(willjf ind-as-head) PL(boyjwill; f ind-as-head) PL(thejboy-as-head) PR(itjf ind-as-head) PR(interestingjit; f ind-as-head)","Here PT (x) is the probability that word x is the root of a dependency tree.
