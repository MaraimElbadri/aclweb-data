We present a method to extract such translations from a large collection of web documents by building a partially parallel corpus and use a word alignment algorithm to identify the terms being translated. The method is able to generalize across the translations for different terms and can reliably extract translations that occurred only once in the entire web. Our experiment on Chinese web pages produced more than 26 million pairs of translations, which is over two orders of magnitude more than previous results. We show that the addition of the extracted translation pairs as training data provides significant increase in the BLEU score for a statistical machine translation system.",""]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In natural language documents, a term (word or phrase) is sometimes followed by its translation in another language in a pair of parentheses. We call these parenthetical translations. The following examples are from Chinese web pages (we added underlines to indicate what is being translated): (1) Brookings Institution","·","Jeremy Shapiro... (2) indigestion","gastritis. (3) not going to fly (4) ...划linear programming).   † Contributions made during an internship at Google","The parenthetically translated terms are typically new words, technical terminologies, idioms, products, titles of movies, books, songs, and names of persons, organizations locations, etc. Commonly, an author might use such a parenthetical when a given term has no standard translation (or transliteration), and does not appear in conventional dictionaries. That is, an author might expect a term to be an out-of-vocabulary item for the target reader, and thus helpfully provides a reference translation in situ.","For example, in (1), the name Shapiro was transliterated as . The name has many other transliterations in web documents, such as , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ..., where the three Chinese characters corresponds to the three syllables in Sha-pi-ro respectively. Each syllable may be mapped into different characters: 'Sha' into or , 'pi' into , , , and 'ro' into , , ....","Variation is not limited to the effects of phonetic similarity. Story titles, for instance, are commonly translated semantically, often leading to a number of translations that have similar meaning, yet differ greatly in lexicographic form. For example, while the movie title Syriana is sometimes phonetically transliterated as , , it may also be translated semantically according to the plot of the movie, e.g., (mystery in mystery), (real log), (spy against spy), (oiltriggered secret war), (Syria), (mystery journey), ...","The parenthetical translations are extremely valuable both as a stand-alone on-line dictionary and as training data for statistical machine translation systems. They provide fresh data (new words) and cover a much wider range of topics than typical parallel training data for statistical machine translation systems. 994","The main contribution of this paper is a method for mining parenthetical translations by treating text snippets containing candidate pairs as a partially parallel corpus and using a word alignment algorithm to establish the correspondences between in-parenthesis and pre-parenthesis words.","This technique allows us to identify translation pairs even if they only appeared once on the entire web. As a result, we were able to obtain 26.7 million Chinese-English translation pairs from web documents in Chinese. This is over two orders of magnitude more than the number of extracted translation pairs in the previously reported results (Cao, et al. 2007).","The next section presents an overview of our algorithm, which is then detailed in Sections 3 and 4. We evaluate our results in Section 5 by comparison with bilingually linked Wikipedia titles and by using the extracted pairs as additional training data in a statistical machine translation system."]},{"title":"2 Mining Parenthetical Translations","paragraphs":["A parenthetical translation matches the pattern: (4) f1f2...fm (e1e2...en) which is a sequence of m non-English words followed by a sequence of n English words in parentheses. In the remainder of the paper, we assume the non-English text is Chinese, but our technique works for other languages as well.","There have been two approaches to finding such parenthetical translations. One is to assume that the English term e1e2...en is given and use a search engine to retrieve text snippets containing e1e2...en from predominately non-English web pages (Nagata et al, 2001, Kwok et al, 2005). Another method (Cao et al, 2007) is to go through a non-English corpus and collect all instances that match the parenthetical pattern in (4). We followed the second approach since it does not require a predefined list of English terms and is amendable for extraction at large scale.","In both cases, one can obtain a list of candidate pairs, where the translation of the in-parenthesis terms is a suffix of the pre-parenthesis text. The lengths and frequency counts of the suffixes have been used to determine what is the translation of the in-parenthesis term (Kwok et al, 2005). For example, Table 1 lists a set of Chinese segments (with word-to-word translation underneath) that precede the English term Lower Egypt. Owing to the frequency with which appears as a candidate, and in varying contexts, one has a good reason to believeis the correct translation of Lower Egypt. ... downstream region is down Egypt","... center located-at down Egypt","... and so-called of down Egypt","... called down Egypt Table 1: Chinese text preceding Lower Egypt","Unfortunately, this heuristic does not hold as often as one might imagine.

(Speech Channel) ... (Block Flat Fading Channel) ... B (Channel B) ... (Fiber Channel Probes) 995","... (Reverse Channel)","... (Reverse Channel)","Unlike previous approaches that rely solely on the preceding text of a single English term to determine its translation, we treat the entire collection of candidate pairs as a partially parallel corpus and establish the correspondences between the words using a word alignment algorithm.","At first glance, word alignment appears to be a more difficult problem than the extraction of parenthetical translations. Extraction of parenthetical translations need only determine the first pre-parenthesis word aligned with an in-parenthesis word, whereas word alignment requires the respective linking of all such (pre,in)-parenthesis word pairs. However, by casting the problem as word alignment, we are able to generalize across instances involving different in-parenthesis terms, giving us a larger number of, and more varied, example contexts per word.","For the examples in Table 2, the words (channel), (wave passage), (signal passage), and (passage) are aligned with Channel, and the words(distance) and (gap) are aligned with Spacing. Given these alignments, the left boundary of the translated Chinese term is simply the leftmost word that is linked to one of the English words.","Our algorithm consists of two steps: Step 1 constructs a partially parallel corpus. This","step takes as input a large collection of Chinese","web pages and converts the sentences with pa-","rentheses containing English text into pairs of","candidates. Step 2 uses an unsupervised algorithm to align","English and Chinese and identify the term being","translated according to the left-most aligned","Chinese word. If no word alignments can be es-","tablished, the pair is not considered a translation. The next two sections present the details of each of the two steps."]},{"title":"3 Constructing a Partially Parallel Corpus 3.1 Filtering out non-translations","paragraphs":["The first step of our algorithm is to extract parentheticals and then filter out those that are not translations. This filtering is required as parenthetical translations represent only a small fraction of the usages for parentheses (see Sec. 5.1). Table 3 shows some example of parentheses that are not translations.","The input to Step 1 is a collection of arbitrary web documents. We used the following criteria to identify candidate pairs:","• The pre-parenthesis text (Tp) is predominantly in Chinese and the in-parenthesis text (Ti) is predominantly in English.","• The concatenation of the digits in Tp must be identical to the concatenation of the digits in Ti. For example, rows a, b and c in Table 3 can be ruled out this way.","• If Tp contains some text in English, the same text must also appear in Ti. This filters out row d.","• Remove the pairs where Ti is part of anchor text. This rule is often applied to instances like row e where the file type tends to be inside a clickable link to a media file.","• The punctuation characters in Tp must also appear in Ti, unless they are quotation marks. The example in row f is ruled out because ‘/’ is not found in the pre-parenthesis text.","Examples with translations in italic Function of the in-parenthesis text","a 1.4~3.0 (MacArthur, 1967) The range of its values is within 1.4~3.0 (MacArthur, 1967) to provide citation","b / (VN901 15:20-22:30) Vietnam Airlines Beijing/Ho Chi Minh (VN901 15:20-22:30) flight information","c 255-8FT sale of pool table (255-8FT) product Id.","d // // void main ( void ) // main program // void main (void ) function declaration","e : (DVD) movie title: Thousand Year Lake (DVD) DVD is the file type","f ( g/L) mass consumed by water sample (g/L) measurement unit","g (Sensitive) gentle protective facial cream (Sensitive) to indicate the type of the cream","h (Ask Jeeves) Evaluation of Nine Main Search Engines in the US: Chapter 4 (Ask Jeeves) Chapter 4 is about Ask Jeeves Table 3: Other uses of parentheses 996 The instances in rows g and h cannot be eliminated by these simple rules, and are filtered only later, as we fail to discover a convincing word alignment. 3.2 Constraining term boundaries Similar to (Cao et al. 2007), we segmented the pre-parenthesis Chinese text and restrict the term boundary to be one of the segmentation boundaries. Since parenthetical translations are mostly translation of terms, it makes sense to further constrain the left boundary of the Chinese side to be a term boundary. Determining what should be counted as a term is a difficult task and there are not yet well-accepted solutions (Sag et al, 2003).","We compiled an approximate term vocabulary by taking the top 5 million most frequent Chinese queries as according to a fully anonymized collection of search engine query logs.","Given a Chinese sentence, we first identify all (possibly overlapping) sequences of words in the sentence that match one of the top-5M queries. A matching sequence is called a maximal match if it is not properly contained in another matching sequence. We then define the potential boundary positions to be the boundaries of maximal matches or words that are not covered by any of the top-5M queries. 3.3"]},{"title":"Length-based trimming","paragraphs":["If there are numerous Chinese words preceding a pair of parentheses containing two English words, it is very unlikely for all but the right-most few Chinese words to be part of the translation of the English words. Including extremely long sequences as potential candidates introduces significantly more noise and makes word alignment harder than necessary. We therefore trimmed the pre-parenthesis text with a length-based constraint. The cut-off point is the first (counting from right to left) potential boundary position (see Sec. 3.2) such that C ≥ 2 E + K, where C is the length of the Chinese text, E is the length of the English text in the parentheses and K is a constant (we used K=6 in our experiments). The lengths C and E are measured in bytes, except when the English text is an abbreviation (in that case, E is multiplied by 5)."]},{"title":"4 Word Alignment","paragraphs":["Word alignment is a well-studied topic in Machine Translation with many algorithms having been proposed (Brown et al, 1993; Och and Ney 2003). We used a modified version of one of the simplest word alignment algorithms called Competitive Linking (Melamed, 2000). The algorithm assumes that there is a score associated with each pair of words in a bi-text. It sorts the word pairs in descending order of their scores, selecting pairs based on the resultant order. A pair of words is linked if none of the two words were previously linked to any other words. The algorithm terminates when there are no more links to make.","Tiedemann (2004) compared a variety of alignment algorithms and found Competitive Linking to have one of the highest precision scores. A disadvantage of Competitive Linking, however, is that the alignments are restricted word-to-word alignments, which implies that multi-word expressions can only be partially linked at best. 4.1 Dealing with multi-word alignment We made a small change to Competitive Linking to allow consecutive sequence of words on one side to be linked to the same word on the other side. Specifically, instead of requiring both ei and fj to have no previous linkages, we only require that at least one of them be unlinked and that (suppose ei is unlinked and fj is linked to ek) none of the words between ei and ek be linked to any word other than fj. 4.2"]},{"title":"Link scoring","paragraphs":["We used φ 2","(Gale and Church, 1991) as the link score in the modified competitive linking algorithm, although there are many other possible choices for the link scores, such as χ 2","(Zhang, S. Vogel. 2005), log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993) and discriminatively trained weights (Taskar et al, 2005).

We set a threshold at 0.001, below which the φ 2 scores are treated as 0. 4.3 Bias in the partially parallel corpus Since only the last few Chinese words in a candidate pair are expected to be translated, there should be a preference for linking the words towards the end of the Chinese text. One advantage of Competitive Linking is that it is quite easy to introduce such preferences into the algorithm, by using the word positions to break ties of the φ 2 scores when sorting the word pairs. 4.4"]},{"title":"Capturing syllable-level regularities","paragraphs":["Many of the parenthetical translations involve proper names, which are often transliterated according to the sound. Word alignment algorithms have generally ignored syllable-level regularities in transliterated terms. Consider again the Shapiro example in the introduction section. There are numerous correct transliterations for the same English word, some of which are not very frequent. For example, the word happens to have a similar φ 2","score with Shapiro as the word (fluency), which is totally unrelated to Shapiro but happened to have the same co-occurrence statistics in the (partially) parallel corpus.","Previous approaches to parenthetical translations relied on specialized algorithms to deal with transliterations (Cao et al, 2007; Jiang et al, 2007; Wu and Chang, 2007). They convert Chinese words into their phonetic representations (Pinyin) and use the known transliterations in a bilingual dictionary to train a transliteration model.","We adopted a simpler approach that does not require any additional resources such as pronuncia-tion dictionaries and bilingual dictionaries. In addition to computing the φ 2 scores between words, we also compute the φ 2","scores of prefixes and suffixes of Chinese and English words. For both languages, the prefix of a word is defined as the first three bytes of the word and the suffix is defined as the last three bytes. Since we used UTF-8 encoding, the first and last three bytes of a Chinese word, except in very rare cases, correspond to the first and last Chinese character of the word. Table 4 lists the English prefixes and suffixes that have the highest φ 2 scores with the Chinese prefix and suffix. ","Type Chinese English","prefix sha, amo, cha, sum, haw, lav, lun,","xia, xal, hnl, shy, eve, she, cfh, ...","suffix rlo, llo, ouh, low, ilo, owe, lol, lor,","zlo, klo, gue, ude, vir, row, oro, olo,","aro, ulo, ero, iro, rro, loh, lok, ... Table 4: Example prefixes and suffixes with top φ2","","In our modified version of the competitive linking algorithm, the link score of a pair of words is the sum of the φ 2","scores of the words themselves, their prefixes and their suffixes. In addition to syllable-level correspondences in transliterations, the φ 2","scores of prefixes and suffixes can also capture correlations in morphologically composed words. For example, the Chinese prefix (three) has a relatively high φ 2","score with the English prefix tri. Such scores enable word alignments to be made that may otherwise be missed. Consider the following text snippet:","...... 氟胺(triaziflam) The correct translation for triaziflam is氟胺 . However, the Chinese term is segmented as + 氟胺. The association between (three) and triaziflam is very weak because is a very frequent word, whereas triaziflam is an extremely rare word. With the addition of the φ 2","score between and tri, we were able to correctly establish the connection between triaziflam and .","It turns out to be quite effective to assume prefixes and suffixes of words consist of three bytes, despite its apparent simplicity. The benefit of φ 2"," scores for prefixes and suffixes is not limited to morphemes that happen to be three bytes long. For example, the English morpheme “du-” corresponds to the Chinese character (two). Although the φ 2 between du and won’t be computed, we do find high φ 2","scores between and due and between and dua. The three letter prefixes account for many of the words with the du- prefix."]},{"title":"5 Experimental Results","paragraphs":["We extracted from Chinese web pages about 1.58 billion unique sentences with parentheses that contain ASCII text. We removed duplicate sentences so that duplications of web documents will not skew the statistics. By applying the filtering algorithm in Sec. 3.1, we constructed a partially paral-998 lel corpus with 126,612,447 candidate pairs (46,791,841 unique), which is about 8% of the number of sentences. Using the word alignment algorithm in Sec. 4, we extracted 26,753,972 translation pairs between 13,471,221 unique English terms and 11,577,206 unique Chinese terms.","Parenthetical translations mined from the Web have mostly been evaluated by manual examina-tion of a small sample of results (usually a few hundred entries) or in a Cross Lingual Information Retrieval setup. There does not yet exist a common evaluation data set. 5.1 Evaluation with Wikipedia Our first evaluation is based on translations in Wikipedia, which contains far more terminology and proper names than bilingual dictionaries. We extracted the titles of Chinese and English Wikipedia articles that are linked to each other and treated them as gold standard translations. There are 79,714 such pairs. We removed the following types of pairs because they are not translations or are not terms: • Pairs with identical strings. For example, both","English and Chinese versions have an entry ti-","tled “.ch”; • Pairs where the English term begins with a","digit, e.g., “245”, “300 BC”, “1991 in film”; • Pairs where the English term matches the regu-","lar expression ‘List of .*’, e.g., “List of birds”,","“List of cinemas in Hong Kong”; • Pairs where the Chinese title does not have any","non-ASCII code. For example, the English en-","try “Syncfusion” is linked to “.NET Frame-","work” in the Chinese Wikipedia.","The resulting data set contains 68,131 translation pairs between 62,581 Chinese terms and 67,613 English terms. Only a small percentage of terms have more than one translation.

Only a small percentage of them are genuine errors. We nonetheless adopted this measure because it has the advantage of automated evaluation and our goal is mainly to compare the relative performances.","To determine the upper bound of the coverage of our web data, for each Wikipedia English term we searched within the total set of available parenthesized text fragments (our English candidate set before filtering as by Step 1). We discovered 81% of the Wikipedia titles, which is approximately 10% above the coverage of our final output. This indicates a minor loss of recall because of mistakes made in filtering (Sec. 3.1) and/or word alignment. 5.2 Evaluation with term translation requests To evaluate the coverage of output produced by their method, Cao et al (2007) extracted English queries from the query log of a Chinese search engine. They assume that the reason why users typed the English queries in a Chinese search box is mostly to find out their Chinese translations. Examining our own Chinese query logs, however, the most-frequent English queries appear to be navigational queries instead of translation requests. We therefore used the following regular expression to identify queries that are unambiguously translation requests: /[̂a-zA-Z ]* $/ wheremeans “’s Chinese”. This regular expression matched 1579 unique queries in the logs. We manually judged the translation for 200 of them. A small random sample of the 200 is shown in Table 8. The empty cells indicate that the English term is missing from our translation pairs. We use * to mark incorrect translations. When compared with the sample queries in (Cao et al., 2007), the queries in our sample seem to contain more phrasal words and technical terminology. It is in-teresting to see that even though parenthetical translations tend to be out-of-vocabulary words, as we have remarked in the introduction, the sheer size of the web means that occasionally translations of common words such as ‘use’ are sometimes included as well. 1000","We compared our results with translations obtained from Google and Yahoo’s translation services. The numbers of correct translations for the random sample of 200 queries are as follows: Systems Google Yahoo! Mined Mined+G Correct 115 84 116 135","Our system’s outputs (Mined) have the same accuracy as the Google Translate. Our outputs have results for 154 out of the 200 queries. The 46 missing results are considered incorrect. If we combine our results with Google Translate by looking up Google results for missing entries, the accuracy increases from 56% to 68% (Mined+G). If we treat the LDC Chinese-English Dictionary 2.0 as a translator, it only covers 20.5% of the 200 queries. 5.3 Evaluation with SMT The extracted translations may serve as training data for statistical machine translation systems. To evaluate their effectiveness for this purpose, we trained a baseline phrase-based SMT system (Koehn et al, 2003; Brants et al, 2007) with the FBIS Chinese-English parallel text (NIST, 2003). We then added the extracted translation pairs as additional parallel training corpus. This resulted in a 0.57 increase of BLEU score based on the test data in the 2006 NIST MT Evaluation Workshop."]},{"title":"6 Related Work","paragraphs":["Nagata et al.
