McInnes Computer Science Department University of Minnesota Twin Cities Minneapolis, MN 55155, USA bthomson@cs.umn.edu Abstract","paragraphs":["This paper introduces an unsupervised vector approach to disambiguate words in biomedical text that can be applied to all-word disambiguation. We explore using contextual information from the Unied Medical Language System (UMLS) to describe the possible senses of a word. We experiment with automatically creating individualized stoplists to help reduce the noise in our dataset. We compare our results to SenseClusters and Humphrey et al. (2006) using the NLM-WSD dataset and with SenseClusters using conated data from the 2005 Medline Baseline."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Some words have multiple senses. For example, the word cold could refer to a viral infection or the temperature. As humans, we nd it easy to determine the appropriate sense (concept) given the context in which the word is used. For a computer, though, this is a difcult problem which negatively impacts the accuracy of biomedical applications such as medical coding and indexing. The goal of our research is to explore using information from biomedical knowledge sources such as the Unied Medical Language System (UMLS) and Medline to help distinguish between different possible concepts of a word.","In the UMLS, concepts associated with words and terms are enumerated via Concept Unique Identiers (CUIs). For example, two possible senses of cold are C0009264: Cold Temperature and C0009443: Common Cold in the UMLS release 2008AA. The UMLS is also encoded with different semantic and syntactic structures. Some such information includes related concepts and semantic types. A semantic type (ST) is a broad subject categorization assigned to a CUI. For example, the ST of C0009264: Cold Temperature is Idea or Concept while the ST for C0009443: Common Cold is Disease or Syndrome. Currently, there exists approximately 1.5 million CUIs and 135 STs in the UMLS. Medline is an online database that contains 11 million references biomedical articles.","In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised vector approach to disambiguate words in biomedical text using contextual information from the UMLS and Medline. We compare our approach to Humphrey et al. (2006) and SenseClusters. The ability to make disambiguation decisions for words that have the same ST differentiates SenseClusters and our approach from Humphrey et al.’s (2006). For example, the word weight in the UMLS has two possible CUIs, C0005912: Body Weight and C0699807: Weight, each having the ST Quantitative Concept. Humphrey et al.’s (2006) approach relies on the concepts having different STs therefore is unable to disambiguate between these two concepts.","Currently, most word sense disambiguation approaches focus on lexical sample disambiguation which only attempts to disambiguate a predened set of words. This type of disambiguation is not practical for large scale systems. All-words disambiguation approaches disambiguate all ambiguous words in a running text making them practical for large scale systems. Unlike SenseClusters, Humphrey, et al. (2006) and our approach can be 49 used to perform all-words disambiguation.","In the following sections, we rst discuss related work. We then discuss our approach, experiments and results. Lastly, we discuss our conclusions and future work."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["There has been previous work on word sense disambiguation in the biomedical domain. Leroy and Rindesch (2005) introduce a supervised approach that uses the UMLS STs and their semantic relations of the words surrounding the target word as features into a Naive Bayes classier. Joshi et al. (2005) introduce a supervised approach that uses unigrams and bigrams surrounding the target word as features into a Support Vector Machine. A unigram is a single content word that occurs in a window of context around the target word. A bigram is an ordered pair of content words that occur in a window of context around the target word. McInnes et al. (2007) introduce a supervised approach that uses CUIs of the words surrounding the target word as features into a Naive Bayes classier.","Humphrey et al. (2006) introduce an unsupervised vector approach using Journal Descriptor (JD) In-dexing (JDI) which is a ranking algorithm that as-signs JDs to journal titles in MEDLINE. The authors apply the JDI algorithm to STs with the assumption that each possible concept has a distinct ST. In this approach, an ST vector is created for each ST by extracting associated words from the UMLS. A target word vector is created using the words surrounding the target word. The JDI algorithm is used to obtain a score for each word-JD and ST-JD pair using the target word and ST vectors. These pairs are used to create a word-ST table using the cosine coefcient between the scores. The cosine scores for the STs of each word surrounding the target word are averaged and the concept associated with the ST that has the highest average is assigned to the target word."]},{"title":"3 Vector Approaches","paragraphs":["Patwardhan and Pedersen (2006) introduce a vector measure to determine the relatedness between pairs of concepts. In this measure, a co-occurrence matrix of all words in a given corpus is created containing how often they occur in the same window of context with each other. A gloss vector is then created for each concept containing the word vector for each word in the concepts denition (or gloss). The cosine between the two gloss vectors is computed to determine the concepts relatedness.","SenseClusters 1","is an unsupervised knowledgelean word sense disambiguation package The package uses clustering algorithms to group similar instances of target words and label them with the appropriate sense. The clustering algorithms include Agglomerative, Graph partitional-based, Partitional biased agglomerative and Direct k-way clustering. The clustering can be done in either vector space where the vectors are clustered directly or similar-ity space where vectors are clustered by nding the pair-wise similarities among the contexts. The feature options available are rst and second-order co-occurrence, unigram and bigram vectors. First-order vectors are highly frequent words, unigrams or bigrams that co-occur in the same window of context as the target word. Second-order vectors are highly frequent words that occur with the words in their respective rst order vector.","We compare our approach to SenseClusters v0.95 using direct k-way clustering with the I2 clustering criterion function and cluster in vector space. We experiment with rst-order unigrams and second-order bigrams with a Log Likelihood Ratio greater than 3.84 and the exact and gap cluster stopping parameters (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004; Kulkarni and Pedersen, 2005)."]},{"title":"4 Our Approach","paragraphs":["Our approach has three stages: i) we create a the feature vector for the target word (instance vector) and each of its possible concepts (concept vectors) using SenseClusters, ii) we calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the concept vectors, and iii) we assign the concept whose concept vector is the closest to the instance vector to the target word.","To create the the instance vector, we use the words that occur in the same abstract as the target word as features. To create the concept vector, we explore four different context descriptions of a possible concept to use as features. Since each possible concept 1 http://senseclusters.sourceforge.net/ 50 has a corresponding CUI in the UMLS, we explore using: i) the words in the concept’s CUI denition, ii) the words in the denition of the concept’s ST denition, iii) the words in both the CUI and ST denitions, and iv) the words in the CUI denition unless one does not exist then the words in its ST denition.","We explore using the same feature vector parameters as in the SenseCluster experiments: i) rst-order unigrams, and ii) second-order bigram. We also explore using a more judicious approach to determine which words to include in the feature vectors. One of the problems with an unsupervised vector approach is its susceptibility to noise. A word frequently seen in a majority of instances may not be useful in distinguishing between different concepts. To alleviate this problem, we create an individualized stoplist for each target word using the inverse document frequency (IDF). We calculate the IDF score for each word surrounding the target word by taking the log of the number of documents in the training data divided by the number of documents the term has occurred in the dataset. We then extract those words that obtain an IDF score under the threshold of one and add them to our basic stoplist to be used when determining the appropriate sense for that specic target word."]},{"title":"5 Data 5.1 Training Data","paragraphs":["We use the abstracts from the 2005 Medline Baseline as training data. The data contains 14,792,864 citations from the 2005 Medline repository. The baseline contains 2,043,918 unique tokens and 295,585 unique concepts. 5.2 NLM-WSD Test Dataset We use the National Library of Medicine’s Word Sense Disambiguation (NLM-WSD) dataset developed by (Weeber et al., 2001) as our test set. This dataset contains 100 instances of 50 ambiguous words from 1998 MEDLINE abstracts. Each instance of a target word was manually disambiguated by 11 human evaluators who assigned the word a CUI or None if none of the CUIs described the concept. (Humphrey et al., 2006) evaluate their approach using a subset of 13 out of the 50 words whose majority sense is less than 65% and whose possible concepts do not have the same ST. Instances tagged as None were removed from the dataset. We evaluate our approach using these same words and instances. 5.3 Conflate Test Dataset To test our algorithm on a larger biomedical dataset, we are creating our own dataset by conating two or more unambiguous words from the 2005 Medline Baseline. We determine which words to conate based on the following criteria: i) the words have a single concept in the UMLS, ii) the words occur approximately the same number of times in the corpus, and iii) the words do not co-occur together.","We create our dataset using name-conf late 2","to extract instances containing the conate words from the 2005 Medline Baseline. Table 4 shows our current set of conated words with their corresponding number of test (test) and training (train) instances.

The results of our approach using different context descriptions show that for the NLM-WSD dataset the large differences in accuracy makes it unclear which of the context descriptions performed the best. On the conated dataset, adding the ST denition to the context description improved the accuracy of only one pseudoword. When comparing our approach to Humphrey et al. (2006) and SenseClusters, our approach did not return a higher accuracy.","When analyzing the data, we found that there does not exist a CUI denition for a large number of possible concepts. Table 5 shows the number of words in the CUI and ST denitions for each concept in the NLM-WSD dataset. Only four target words have a CUI denition for each possible concept. We also found the concept denitions vary widely in length. The CUI denitions in the UMLS come from a variety of sources and there may exist more than one denition per source. Unlike CUI denitions, there does exist an ST denition for each possible concept. The ST denitions come from the same source and are approximately the same length but they are a broad categorization. We believe this makes them too coarse grained to provide descriptive enough information about their associated concepts.","This can also be seen when analyzing the conate datasets.

Our approach makes disambiguation decisions for words that have the same ST unlike Humphrey et al. (2006). We believe that our approach shows promise and leads us to our goal of exploring the use of biomedical knowledge sources.","In the future, we would also like to increase the size of our conated dataset and possibly create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach. Unlike SenseClusters, our approach can be used to perform all-words disambiguation. For example, given the sentence: His weight has fluctuated during the past month. We rst create a instance vector containing f luctuated, past and months for the word weight and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, C0005912: Body Weight and C0699807: Quantitative Concept using their context descriptions. We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for f luctuated, past and months.","We also plan to explore using different contextual information to improve the accuracy of our approach. We are currently exploring using co-occurrence and relational information about the possible CUIs in the UMLS. Our IDF stoplist experiments show promise, we are planning to explore other measures to determine which words to include in the stoplist as well as a way to automatically determine the threshold."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The author thanks Ted Pedersen, John Carlis and Siddharth Patwardhan for their comments.","Our experiments were conducted using CuiTools v0.15, which is freely available from http://cuitools.sourceforge.net."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["S.M.
