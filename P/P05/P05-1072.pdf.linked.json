The architec-ture underlying all of these systems introduces two distinct sub-problems: the identificationof syntactic constituents that are semantic roles for a given predicate, and the labeling of the those constituents with the correct semantic role.","A detailed error analysis of our baseline system indicates that the identificationproblem poses a significantbottleneck to improving overall system performance. The baseline system’s accuracy on the task of labeling nodes known to represent semantic arguments is 90%. On the other hand, the system’s performance on the identification task is quite a bit lower, achieving only 80% recall with 86% precision. There are two sources of these identification errors: i) failures by the system to identify all and only those constituents that correspond to semantic roles, when those constituents are present in the syntactic analysis, and ii) failures by the syntactic analyzer to provide the constituents that align with correct arguments. The work we present here is tailored to address these two sources of error in the identification problem.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We first describe a baseline system based on the best published techniques. We then report on two sets of experiments using techniques that improve performance on the problem of finding arguments when they are present in the syntactic analysis. In the first set of experiments we explore new 581 features, including features extracted from a parser that provides a different syntactic view – a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) parser (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002). In the second set of experiments, we explore approaches to identify optimal subsets of features for each argument class, and to calibrate the classifierprobabilities.","We then report on experiments that address the problem of arguments missing from a given syntactic analysis. We investigate ways to combine hypotheses generated from semantic role taggers trained using different syntactic views – one trained using the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000), another on a rule-based dependency parser – Minipar (Lin, 1998), and a third based on a flat, shallow syntactic chunk representation (Hacioglu, 2004a). We show that these three views complement each other to improve performance."]},{"title":"2 Baseline System","paragraphs":["For our experiments, we use Feb 2004 release of PropBank1","(Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002; Palmer et al., 2005), a corpus in which predicate argument relations are marked for verbs in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1994). PropBank was constructed by as-signing semantic arguments to constituents of hand-corrected TreeBank parses. Arguments of a verb are labeled ARG0 to ARG5, where ARG0 is the PROTO-AGENT, ARG1 is the PROTO-PATIENT, etc. In addition to these CORE ARGUMENTS, additional ADJUNCTIVE ARGUMENTS, referred to as ARGMs are also marked. Some examples are ARGM-LOC, for locatives; ARGM-TMP, for temporals; ARGM-MNR, for manner, etc. Figure 1 shows a syntax tree along with the argument labels for an example extracted from PropBank. We use Sections 02-21 for training, Section 00 for development and Section 23 for testing.","We formulate the semantic labeling problem as a multi-class classification problem using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier (Hacioglu et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2004) TinySVM2","along with YamCha3","(Kudo and Mat-1 http://www.cis.upenn.edu/ãce/ 2 http://chasen.org/t̃aku/software/TinySVM/ 3 http://chasen.org/t̃aku/software/yamcha/ S ","NP ","T he acquisition ARG1 VP VBD was NULL VP VBN completed predicate","PP"," in September ARGM−TMP","[ARG1 The acquisition] was [predicate completed] [ARGM−TMP in September].

A dependency grammar should generate shorter paths from the predicate to dependent words in the sentence, and could be a more robust complement to the phrase structure grammar paths extracted from the Charniak parse tree. Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003) report that using features extracted from a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) representation improves semantic labeling performance on core arguments. We evaluated features from a CCG parser combined with our baseline feature set. We used three features that were introduced by Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003):","Phrase type – This is the category of the maximal projection between the two words – the predicate and the dependent word.","Categorial Path – This is a feature formed by concatenating the following three values: i) category to which the dependent word belongs, ii) the direction of dependence and iii) the slot in the category filledby the dependent word.","Tree Path – This is the categorial analogue of the path feature in the Charniak parse based system, which traces the path from the dependent word to the predicate through the binary CCG tree.","Parallel to the hand-corrected TreeBank parses, we also had access to correct CCG parses derived from the TreeBank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002a). We performed two sets of experiments. One using the correct CCG parses, and the other using parses obtained using StatCCG4","parser (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002). We incorporated these features in the systems based on hand-corrected TreeBank parses and Charniak parses respectively. For each constituent in the Charniak parse tree, if there was a dependency between the head word of the constituent and the predicate, then the corresponding CCG features for those words were added to the features for that constituent.

Error analysis showed that some features specifically suited for one argument class, for example, core arguments, tend to hurt performance on some adjunctive arguments. Therefore, we thought that selecting subsets of features for each argument class might improve performance. To achieve this, we performed a simple feature selection procedure. For each argument, we started with the set of features introduced by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). We pruned this set by training classifiers after leaving out one feature at a time and checking its performance on a development set. We used the χ2","significance while making pruning decisions. Following that, we added each of the other features one at a time to the pruned baseline set of features and selected ones that showed significantly improved performance. Since the feature selection experiments were computationally intensive, we performed them using 10k training examples.","SVMs output distances not probabilities. These distances may not be comparable across classifiers, especially if different features are used to train each binary classifier. In the baseline system, we used the algorithm described by Platt (Platt, 2000) to convert the SVM scores into probabilities by fittingto a sigmoid. When all classifiersused the same set of features, fittingall scores to a single sigmoid was found to give the best performance. Since different feature sets are now used by the classifiers, we trained a separate sigmoid for each classifier.

The probabilities resulting from either conversions may not be properly calibrated. So, we binned the probabilities and trained a warping func-tion to calibrate them. For each argument classifier, we used both the methods for converting raw SVM scores into probabilities and calibrated them using a development set. Then, we visually inspected the calibrated plots for each classifierand chose the method that showed better calibration as the calibration procedure for that classifier. Plots of the predicted probabilities versus true probabilities for the ARGM-TMP VS ALL classifier, before and after calibration are shown in Figure 2.

Additional features can’t recover from the situation where the parse tree being used for classification doesn’t contain the correct constituent representing an argument. Such parse errors account for about 7% absolute of the errors (or, about half of 12.7%) for the Charniak parse based system. To address these errors, we added two additional parse representations: i) Minipar dependency parser, and ii) chunking parser (Hacioglu et al., 2004). The hope is that these parsers will produce different errors than the Charniak parser since they represent different syntactic views. The Charniak parser is trained on the Penn TreeBank corpus. Minipar is a rule based dependency parser. The chunking parser is trained on PropBank and produces a flat syntactic representation that is very different from the full parse tree produced by Charniak. A combination of the three different parses could produce better results than any single one. 5.1 Minipar-based Semantic Labeler Minipar (Lin, 1998; Lin and Pantel, 2001) is a rule-based dependency parser. It outputs dependencies between a word called head and another called modifier. Each word can modify at most one word. The dependency relationships form a dependency tree.","The set of words under each node in Minipar’s dependency tree form a contiguous segment in the original sentence and correspond to the constituent in a constituent tree. We formulate the semantic labeling problem in the same way as in a constituent structure parse, except we classify the nodes that represent head words of constituents. A similar for-mulation using dependency trees derived from TreeBank was reported in Hacioglu (Hacioglu, 2004). In that experiment, the dependency trees were derived from hand-corrected TreeBank trees using head word rules. Here, an SVM is trained to assign PropBank argument labels to nodes in Minipar dependency trees using the following features:","Table 8 shows the performance of the Minipar-based semantic parser.","Minipar performance on the PropBank corpus is substantially worse than the Charniak based system.

This feature is the dependencies along the path that connects two words. VOICE POSITION Table 7: Features used in the Baseline system using Minipar parses.

In experiments reported by Hacioglu (Hacioglu, 2004), a mismatch of about 8% was introduced in the transformation from hand-corrected constituent trees to dependency trees. Using an errorful automatically generated tree, a still higher mismatch would be expected. In case of the CCG parses, as reported by Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003), the mismatch was about 23%. A more realistic way to score the performance is to score tags assigned to head words of constituents, rather than considering the exact boundaries of the constituents as reported by Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003).
