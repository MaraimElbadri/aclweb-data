We evaluate across two corpora (conversational telephone speech and broadcast news speech) on both human transcriptions and speech recognition output. In general, our CRF model yields a lower error rate than the HMM and Maxent models on the NIST sentence boundary detection task in speech, although it is interesting to note that the best results are achieved by three-way voting among the classifiers.

Sentence segmentation information is crucial and as-sumed in most of the further processing steps that one would want to apply to such output: tagging and parsing, information extraction, summarization, among others. 1.1 Sentence Segmentation Using HMM Most prior work on sentence segmentation (Shriberg et al., 2000; Gotoh and Renals, 2000; Christensen et al., 2001; Kim and Woodland, 2001; NIST-RT03F, 2003) have used an HMM approach, in which the word/tag sequences are modeled by N-gram language models (LMs) (Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996). Additional features (mostly related to speech prosody) are modeled as observation likelihoods at-tached to the N-gram states of the HMM (Shriberg et al., 2000). Figure 1 shows the graphical model representation of the variables involved in the HMM for this task. Note that the words appear in both the states1","and the observations, such that the word stream constrains the possible hidden states to matching words; the ambiguity in the task stems entirely from the choice of events. This architec-ture differs from the one typically used for sequence tagging (e.g., part-of-speech tagging), in which the “hidden” states represent only the events or tags. Empirical investigations have shown that omitting words in the states significantly degrades system performance for sentence boundary detection (Liu, 2004). The observation probabilities in the HMM, implemented using a decision tree classifier, capture the probabilities of generating the prosodic features 1 In this sense, the states are only partially “hidden”. 451","P","","F","i j E i ","W","i","",".2","An N-gram LM is used to calculate","the transition probabilities:","P","","W","i","E","i","j","W","","E","    W","i","","","E","i","","","","","P","","W","i","j","W","","E","    W","i","","","E","i","","","","","P","","E","i","j","W","","E","    W","i","","","E","i","","","E","i"," In the HMM, the forward-backward algorithm is used to determine the event with the highest posterior probability for each interword boundary:","","E i ","arg","max E i","P","","E i j W","","F","","(1) The HMM is a generative modeling approach since it describes a stochastic process with hidden variables (sentence boundary) that produces the observ-able data. This HMM approach has two main drawbacks. First, standard training methods maximize the joint probability of observed and hidden events, as opposed to the posterior probability of the correct hidden variable assignment given the observations, which would be a criterion more closely related to classification performance. Second, the N-gram LM underlying the HMM transition model makes it difficult to use features that are highly correlated (such as words and POS labels) without greatly increas-ing the number of model parameters, which in turn would make robust estimation difficult. More details about using textual information in the HMM system are provided in Section 3. 1.2 Sentence Segmentation Using Maxent A maximum entropy (Maxent) posterior classification method has been evaluated in an attempt to overcome some of the shortcomings of the HMM approach (Liu et al., 2004; Huang and Zweig, 2002).

Maxent is a discriminative model; however, it attempts to make decisions locally, without using sequential information.","A conditional random field (CRF) model (Lafferty et al., 2001) combines the benefits of the HMM and Maxent approaches. Hence, in this paper we will evaluate the performance of the CRF model and relate the results to those using the HMM and Maxent approaches on the sentence boundary detection task. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the CRF model and discusses how it differs from the HMM and Maxent models. Section 3 describes the data and features used in the models to be compared. Section 4 summarizes the experimental results for the sentence boundary detection task.

CRFs have been successfully used for a variety of text processing tasks (Lafferty et al., 2001; Sha and Pereira, 2003; McCallum and Li, 2003), but they have not been widely applied to a speech-related task with both acoustic and textual knowledge sources.

The underlying N-gram sequence model of an HMM does not cope well with multiple representations (features) of the word sequence (e.g., words, POS), especially when the training set is small; however, the CRF model supports simultaneous correlated features, and therefore gives greater freedom for incorporating a variety of knowledge sources. A CRF differs from the Maxent method with respect to its ability to model sequence information. The primary advantage of the CRF over the Maxent approach is that the model is optimized globally over the entire sequence; whereas, the Maxent model makes a local decision, as shown in Equation (2), without utilizing any state dependency information.","We use the Mallet package (McCallum, 2002) to implement the CRF model. To avoid overfitting, we employ a Gaussian prior with a zero mean on the parameters (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999), similar to what is used for training Maxent models (Liu et al., 2004)."]},{"title":"3 Experimental Setup 3.1 Data and Task Description","paragraphs":["The sentence-like units in speech are different from those in written text. In conversational speech, these units can be well-formed sentences, phrases, or even a single word. These units are called SUs in the DARPA EARS program. SU boundaries, as 453 well as other structural metadata events, were an-notated by LDC according to an annotation guideline (Strassel, 2003). Both the transcription and the recorded speech were used by the annotators when labeling the boundaries.","The SU detection task is conducted on two corpora: Broadcast News (BN) and Conversational Telephone Speech (CTS). BN and CTS differ in genre and speaking style. The average length of SUs is longer in BN than in CTS, that is, 12.35 words (standard deviation 8.42) in BN compared to 7.37 words (standard deviation 8.72) in CTS. This difference is reflected in the frequency of SU boundaries: about 14% of interword boundaries are SUs in CTS compared to roughly 8% in BN. Training and test data for the SU detection task are those used in the NIST Rich Transcription 2003 Fall evaluation. We use both the development set and the evaluation set as the test set in this paper in order to obtain more meaningful results. For CTS, there are about 40 hours of conversational data (around 480K words) from the Switchboard corpus for training and 6 hours (72 conversations) for testing. The BN data has about 20 hours of Broadcast News shows (about 178K words) in the training set and 3 hours (6 shows) in the test set. Note that the SU-annotated training data is only a subset of the data used for the speech recognition task because more effort is required to annotate the boundaries.","For testing, the system determines the locations of sentence boundaries given the word sequence W and the speech. The SU detection task is evaluated on both the reference human transcriptions (REF) and speech recognition outputs (STT). Evaluation across transcription types allows us to obtain the performance for the best-case scenario when the transcriptions are correct; thus factoring out the confounding effect of speech recognition errors on the SU detection task. We use the speech recognition output obtained from the SRI recognizer (Stolcke et al., 2003).","System performance is evaluated using the official NIST evaluation tools.4","System output is scored by first finding a minimum edit distance alignment between the hypothesized word string and the refer-4 See http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/rt/rt2003/fall/ for","more details about scoring. ence transcriptions, and then comparing the aligned event labels. The SU error rate is defined as the total number of deleted or inserted SU boundary events, divided by the number of true SU boundaries. In addition to this NIST SU error metric, we use the total number of interword boundaries as the denominator, and thus obtain results for the per-boundary-based metric. 3.2 Feature Extraction and Modeling To obtain a good-quality estimation of the conditional probability of the event tag given the observations P","","E","i","j","O","i","",", the observations should be based on features that are discriminative of the two events (SU versus not). As in (Liu et al., 2004), we utilize both textual and prosodic information.","We extract prosodic features that capture duration, pitch, and energy patterns associated with the word boundaries (Shriberg et al., 2000). For all the modeling methods, we adopt a modular approach to model the prosodic features, that is, a decision tree classifier is used to model them. During testing, the decision tree prosody model estimates posterior probabilities of the events given the associated prosodic features for a word boundary. The posterior probability estimates are then used in various modeling approaches in different ways as described later.","Since words and sentence boundaries are mutually constraining, the word identities themselves (from automatic recognition or human transcriptions) constitute a primary knowledge source for sentence segmentation. We also make use of various automatic taggers that map the word sequence to other representations. Tagged versions of the word stream are provided to support various generaliza-tions of the words and to smooth out possibly undertrained word-based probability estimates. These tags include part-of-speech tags, syntactic chunk tags, and automatically induced word classes. In addition, we use extra text corpora, which were not an-notated according to the guideline used for the training and test data (Strassel, 2003). For BN, we use the training corpus for the LM for speech recognition. For CTS, we use the Penn Treebank Switchboard data. There is punctuation information in both, which we use to approximate SUs as defined in the annotation guideline (Strassel, 2003).","As explained in Section 1, the prosody model and 454 Table 1: Knowledge sources and their representations in different modeling approaches: HMM, Maxent, and CRF.","HMM Maxent CRF","generative model conditional approach Sequence information yes no yes","LDC data set (words or tags) LM N-grams as indicator functions","Probability from prosody model real-valued cumulatively binned Additional text corpus N-gram LM binned posteriors Speaker turn change in prosodic features a separate feature,","in addition to being in the prosodic feature set Compound feature no POS tags and decisions from prosody model the N-gram LM can be integrated in an HMM. When various textual information is used, jointly modeling words and tags may be an effective way to model the richer feature set; however, a joint model requires more parameters. Since the training set for the SU detection task in the EARS program is quite limited, we use a loosely coupled approach:"," Linearly combine three LMs: the word-based LM from the LDC training data, the automatic-class-based LMs, and the word-based LM trained from the additional corpus.","","These interpolated LMs are then combined","with the prosody model via the HMM.

The detection error rate is reported using the NIST SU error rate, as well as the per-boundary-based classification error rate (in parentheses in the table) in order to factor out the effect of the different SU priors. Also shown in the tables are the majority vote results over the three modeling approaches when all the features are used. 4.1 CTS Results For CTS, we find from Table 2 that the CRF is superior to both the HMM and the Maxent model across all conditions (the differences are significant at p","  ","","). When using only the word N-gram information, the gain of the CRF is the greatest, with the differences among the models diminishing as more features are added. This may be due to the impact of the sparse data problem on the CRF or simply due to the fact that differences among modeling approaches are less when features become stronger, that is, the good features compensate for the weaknesses in models. Notice that with fewer knowledge sources (e.g., using only word N-gram and prosodic information), the CRF is able to achieve performance similar to or even better than other methods using all the knowledges sources. This may be useful when feature extraction is computationally expensive.","We observe from Table 2 that there is a large increase in error rate when evaluating on speech recognition output. This happens in part because word information is inaccurate in the recognition output, thus impacting the effectiveness of the LMs and lexical features. The prosody model is also affected, since the alignment of incorrect words to the speech is imperfect, thereby degrading prosodic feature extraction. However, the prosody model is more robust to recognition errors than textual knowledge, because of its lesser dependence on word identity. The results show that the CRF suffers most from the recognition errors. By focusing on the results when only word N-gram information is used, we can see the effect of word errors on the models. The SU detection error rate increases more in the STT condition for the CRF model than for the other models, suggesting that the discriminative CRF model suffers more from the mismatch between the training (using the reference transcription) and the test condition (features obtained from the errorful words).","We also notice from the CTS results that when only word N-gram information is used (with or without combining with prosodic information), the HMM is superior to the Maxent; only when various additional textual features are included in the feature set does Maxent show its strength compared to 456","Table 3: Broadcast news SU detection results reported using the NIST SU error rate (%) and the boundary-","based error rate (% in parentheses) using the HMM, Maxent, and CRF individually and in combination.

Previously, it was found that the Maxent and HMM posteriors combine well because the two approaches have different error patterns (Liu et al., 2004). For example, Maxent yields fewer insertion errors than HMM because of its reliance on different knowledge sources. The toolkit we use for the implementation of the CRF does not generate a posterior probability for a sequence; therefore, we do not combine the system output via posterior probability interpola-tion, which is expected to yield better performance. 4.2 BN Results Table 3 shows the SU detection results for BN. Similar to the patterns found for the CTS data, the CRF consistently outperforms the HMM and Maxent, except on the STT condition when all the features are used. The CRF yields relatively less gain over the other approaches on BN than on CTS. One possible reason for this difference is that there is more training data for the CTS task, and both the CRF and Maxent approaches require a relatively larger training set than the HMM. Overall the degradation on the STT condition for BN is smaller than on CTS. This can be easily explained by the difference in word error rates, 22.9% on CTS and 12.1% on BN. Finally, the vote among the three approaches outperforms any model on both the REF and STT conditions, and the gain from voting is larger for BN than CTS.","Comparing Table 2 and Table 3, we find that the NIST SU error rate on BN is generally higher than on CTS. This is partly because the NIST error rate is measured as the percentage of errors per reference SU, and the number of SUs in CTS is much larger than for BN, giving a large denominator and a relatively lower error rate for the same number of boundary detection errors. Another reason is that the training set is smaller for BN than for CTS. Finally, the two genres differ significantly: CTS has the advantage of the frequent backchannels and first person pronouns that provide good cues for SU detection. When the boundary-based classification metric is used (results in parentheses), the SU error rate is lower on BN than on CTS; however, it should also be noted that the baseline error rate (i.e., the priors of the SUs) is lower on BN than CTS."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["Finding sentence boundaries in speech transcriptions is important for improving readability and aid-ing downstream language processing modules. In this paper, prosodic and textual knowledge sources are integrated for detecting sentence boundaries in speech. We have shown that a discriminatively trained CRF model is a competitive approach for the sentence boundary detection task. The CRF combines the advantages of being discriminatively trained and able to model the entire sequence, and so it outperforms the HMM and Maxent approaches 457 consistently across various testing conditions. The CRF takes longer to train than the HMM and Maxent models, especially when the number of features becomes large; the HMM requires the least training time of all approaches. We also find that as more features are used, the differences among the modeling approaches decrease. We have explored different approaches to modeling various knowledge sources in an attempt to achieve good performance for sentence boundary detection. Note that we have not fully optimized each modeling approach. For example, for the HMM, using discriminative training methods is likely to improve system performance, but possibly at a cost of reducing the accuracy of the combined system.","In future work, we will examine the effect of Viterbi decoding versus forward-backward decoding for the CRF approach, since the latter better matches the classification accuracy metric. To improve SU detection results on the STT condition, we plan to investigate approaches that model recognition uncertainty in order to mitigate the effect of word errors. Another future direction is to investigate how to effectively incorporate prosodic features more directly in the Maxent or CRF framework, rather than using a separate prosody model and then binning the resulting posterior probabilities.","Important ongoing work includes investigating the impact of SU detection on downstream language processing modules, such as parsing. For these applications, generating probabilistic SU decisions is crucial since that information can be more effectively used by subsequent modules."]},{"title":"6 Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The authors thank the anonymous reviewers for their valu-able comments, and Andrew McCallum and Aron Culotta at the University of Massachusetts and Fernando Pereira at the University of Pennsylvania for their assistance with their CRF toolkit.
