The estimation of log-linear models requires high computational cost, especially with wide-coverage grammars. Using techniques to reduce the estimation cost, we trained the models using 20 sections of Penn Treebank. A series of experiments empirically evaluated the estimation techniques, and also examined the performance of the disambiguation models on the parsing of real-world sentences."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag, 1994) has been studied extensively from both linguistic and computational points of view. However, despite research on HPSG processing efficiency (Oepen et al., 2002a), the application of HPSG parsing is still limited to specific domains and short sentences (Oepen et al., 2002b; Toutanova and Manning, 2002). Scaling up HPSG parsing to assess real-world texts is an emerging research field with both theoretical and practical applications.","Recently, a wide-coverage grammar and a large treebank have become available for English HPSG (Miyao et al., 2004). A large treebank can be used as training and test data for statistical models. Therefore, we now have the basis for the development and the evaluation of statistical disambiguation models for wide-coverage HPSG parsing.","The aim of this paper is to report the development of log-linear models for the disambiguation in wide-coverage HPSG parsing, and their empirical evaluation through the parsing of the Wall Street Journal of Penn Treebank II (Marcus et al., 1994). This is challenging because the estimation of log-linear models is computationally expensive, and we require solutions to make the model estimation tractable. We apply two techniques for reducing the training cost. One is the estimation on a packed representation of HPSG parse trees (Section 3). The other is the filtering of parse candidates according to a preliminary probability distribution (Section 4).","To our knowledge, this work provides the first results of extensive experiments of parsing Penn Treebank with a probabilistic HPSG. The results from the Wall Street Journal are significant because the complexity of the sentences is different from that of short sentences. Experiments of the parsing of real-world sentences can properly evaluate the effectiveness and possibility of parsing models for HPSG."]},{"title":"2 Disambiguation models for HPSG","paragraphs":["Discriminative log-linear models are now becom-ing a de facto standard for probabilistic disambiguation models for deep parsing (Johnson et al., 1999; Riezler et al., 2002; Geman and Johnson, 2002; Miyao and Tsujii, 2002; Clark and Curran, 2004b; Kaplan et al., 2004). Previous studies on probabilistic models for HPSG (Toutanova and Manning, 2002; Baldridge and Osborne, 2003; Malouf and van Noord, 2004) also adopted log-linear models. HPSG exploits feature structures to represent linguistic constraints. Such constraints are known 83 to introduce inconsistencies in probabilistic models estimated using simple relative frequency (Abney, 1997). Log-linear models are required for credible probabilistic models and are also beneficial for incorporating various overlapping features.

However, their method has the advantage that any features on a parse tree can be incorporated into the model. The trade-off between approximation and locality of features is an outstanding problem.","Other discriminative classifiers were applied to the disambiguation in HPSG parsing (Baldridge and Osborne, 2003; Toutanova et al., 2004). The problem of exponential explosion is also inevitable for 89 their methods. An approach similar to ours may be applied to them, following the study on the learning of a discriminative classifier for a packed representation (Taskar et al., 2004).","As discussed in Section 6, exploration of other features is indispensable to further improvements. A possible direction is to encode larger contexts of parse trees, which were shown to improve the accuracy (Toutanova and Manning, 2002; Toutanova et al., 2004).
