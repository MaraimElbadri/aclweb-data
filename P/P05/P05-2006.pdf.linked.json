This paper presents a model for the automatic detection of INTENTION semantic relation. Our approach firstidentifies the syntactic patterns that encode intentions, then we select syntactic and semantic features for a SVM learning classifier. In conclusion, we discuss the application of INTENTION relations to Q&A."]},{"title":"1 Introduction 1.1 Problem description","paragraphs":["Intentions comprise of semantic relationships that express a human’s goal-oriented private states of mind, including intents, objectives, aims, and purposes. As a relation, it encodes information that might not be explicitly stated in text and its detection might require inferences and human judgment. The answer to the question What was Putin trying to achieve by increasing military cooperation with North Korea? is found in the sentence Putin is attempting to restore Russia’s influence in the East Asian region. Extracting the exact answer to restore Russia’s influence in the East Asian region becomes easier if this is recognized as Putin’s intention which matches the question’s expected answer.","In this paper, we describe a method that identifiesintentions in domain independent texts. We employed two machine learning algorithms to create models that locate intentions in a given paragraph using a set of six syntactic and semantic features. 1.2 Motivation The current state-of-the-art NLP systems cannot extract intentions from open text and, as we saw in the example, their detection benefits Question Answering. An intention is the answer to general questions like What is the goal of X?, What does X plan to do?, or What does X aim for? The INTENTION semantic relation is one of the most challenging relations because text fragments may convey unstated intentions. These are most pervasive in dialogues, communication specific to humans. For example, in the following conversation, the vendor infers the client’s unstated intention of buying the cups.","Customer: Where do you have the $1 cups?","Salesman: How many do you want?","Intentions are closely related to other semantic relations such as beliefs, motives, desires, or plans. In the above example, the context tells us that this takes place in a superstore, well-known as a place where people buy things from. The clerk’s answer emerges from our common beliefs and background knowledge as well as from his desire to help a customer. Intentions are the framework for plans. Many philosophers and artificial intelligence researchers studied the intentions as parts of coordinating plans (Bratman, 1987; Pollack, 1990) because people establish plans for future times.","In this paper, we regard intentions as expressions of a particular action that shall take place in the future, in which the speaker is some sort of agent (Anscombe, 1957). For example, the sentence Mary is going to buy a TV set shows Mary’s intention. Anscombe (1957) considers intentions as a subclass of predictions, besides commands and 31 prophecies. John is going to be sick is usually a prophecy, John, go for a walk! is an order, and John plans to take a walk expresses an intention. 1.3 Previous work Various methodologies have been proposed and used over the years for the task of extracting semantic relations from text. Purely probabilistic models, empirical methods, or hand-coded constraints were some of the approaches that do not use machine learning algorithms. Later on, methods that use decision tree, neural networks, memory-based learning, or support vector machines were introduced. Currently, there is also a increased interest in shallow semantic parsing of open texts and automatic labeling of semantic roles. Wiebe et al. (2004) focused on the detection of subjective language such as opinions, evaluations, or emotions in text. Using clues of subjectivity (low-frequency words, collocations), they identify opinion piece texts such as editorials, letters to the editor, or arts and leisure reviews.","There exists an immense literature in philosophy about the different types of intentions and their characteristics. Bratman (1987) tries to find the relationship between the two distinct phenomena of doing something intentionally and intending to do something. Numerous philosophical studies discuss how intentions relate to other psychological concepts, such as, beliefs, desires, hopes, or expectations (Audi, 1973; Bratman, 1981; Bratman, 1987). Intentions are consistent with the person’s beliefs, and, unlike ordinary desires, require consistency (Bratman, 1987). They can generate reasons for or against future intentions (Bratman, 1981; Bratman, 1987). As plan elements, intentions require a certain stability. Their side effects need not be intended, even if they were taken into considera-tion in the firstplace1","(Bratman, 1990)."]},{"title":"2 Syntax and Semantics of Intention 2.1 Syntactic patterns","paragraphs":["Because, in all the cases that we encountered, intentions were conveyed by phrases, we took a closer look at how intentions can be expressed in the written text. For our investigations, we chose the Sem-1 Due to space limitations, we couldn’t include detailed ex-","amples. Please see the cited articles for examples. Cor text collection (Miller et al., 1993), a subset of the Brown corpus manually tagged with WordNet senses (37,176 sentences in 352 newspaper articles). After manually classifying the first 2,700 sentences from SemCor into sentences that contain or not intentions, only 46 examples were identified. The syntactic patterns listed in Table 1 cover 95.65% of them. Because the firstpattern comprises more than half of the studied examples, our algorithm focuses on detecting intentions encoded by  to ",". We note that this pattern is ambiguous and may convey other semantics. For instance, Mary began to play with the dog, He told her to meet you are encoded by our pattern, but do not express intentions. Pattern Example Frequency ","to","plan to go for a walk 27 (58.69) NN to VB strivings to give up drink 6 (13.04) VB PP VP He resigned so that he can work 5 (10.87)","for the school campaign goal/purpose is to VB his goal is to leave the country 4 (8.69) ADJ to VB eager to end a pitching slump 2 (4.34) Table 1: INTENTION syntactic patterns 2.2 Semantics of intentions From the semantic point of view, an intention may be very specific, it may contain a future time or a location (John intends to meet Mary today), but every intention must specify a future action. Hence, we propose the following representation for the INTENTION semantic relation: INT(    ) where   is the event denoting the intention,   denotes the person that has the intention and ","is the intended action or event. If the intention is more specific then we will identify instances of other semantic relations2",". INT               THEME","  "," TIME  ","represents a more specificintention.","The semantics of the INTENTION relation allows the derivation of inference rules which show that INTENTION dominates other semantic relations such as PURPOSE, ENTAIL, or ISA. For example, if a person  intends to perform action  and this action has a purpose  , then we can say that   intends to do   3 . Formally, we can express the above relations 2 The list of semantic relations that can specialize an INT","includes THEME, LOCATION, TEMPORAL, MANNER, INSTRU-","MENT, SOURCE, MEANS, and FREQUENCY. Their arguments","are",", the intention verb, and a corresponding",". 3 Similar statements can be made for the ENTAIL and ISA 32","with the following set of implications4",":","INT","","","","","","","","PURPOSE  ","","","INT","","","","","","","INT","","","","","","","","","","ENTAIL","    ","","INT","","","","","","","","","","INT","","","","","","","","","","IS-A","","    ","INT","","","","","","","","","","INT","","","","","","","","PURPOSE  ","","","","INT","","","","","","","INT","","","","","","","","","","CAUSE","    ","","","INT","","","","","","","","","","The first three implications formalize the above inference rules. If John intends to start his car to go to the park, then John intends to go to the park. Similarly, if John intends to buy a car, then we can say that he intends to pay for it. The sentences John intends to go to the park. He’s starting his car right now express John’s intention to go to the park (  ). The purpose of starting the car ( ",") is to go to the park. We cannot say that John intends to start his car. This is just an intentional action done to achieve his objective. The fifthrule tries to eliminate the effects (  ) of an intention ( ",") from being considered as intentions or objectives. If John intends to swim in the pool (  ) even if he knows that he is going to catch a cold ( ",") because the water is too cold, we cannot say that John intends to catch a cold.5","The traditional relational properties (refle xivity, symmetry, or transitivity) do not hold for the INTENTION semantic relation."]},{"title":"3 Learning Model 3.1 Experimental data","paragraphs":["We applied the most frequent syntactic pattern that expresses intentions in text (","  to"," ",") on the first 10,000 sentences of the SemCor2.0 collection and we extracted 1,873 sentences.

The WordNet senses needed to extract the semantic features were taken from SemCor. We will use Mary intends to revise the paper to show each feature’s value.","The semantic class of the the"," ","verb’s agent or specializations of it.

There can be an enormous number of possibilities and any models built using them as feature values will not be able to generalize beyond the training examples. Therefore, we introduce a bias in our learning framework based on the assumption: noun and verb concepts will semantically behave as the concepts that subsume them in the WordNet structures. But, by generalizing concepts, we lose some of their semantic properties. Hence, we specialize the semantic class","of a concept","by replacing it with its immediate hyponym (",") that subsumes",".

All three models exhibit a similar behavior with respect to the change in the training set size. Therefore, our features create a stable algorithm.
