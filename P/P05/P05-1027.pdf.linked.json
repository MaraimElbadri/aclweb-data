This new QBTE approach liberates QA systems from the heavy burden imposed by question types (or answer types). In conventional approaches, a QA system analyzes a given question and determines the question type, and then it selects answers from among answer candidates that match the question type. Consequently, the output of a QA system is restricted by the design of the question types. The QBTE directly extracts answers as terms biased by the question. To conrm the feasibility of our QBTE approach, we conducted experiments on the CRL QA Data based on 10-fold cross validation, using Maximum Entropy Models (MEMs) as an ML technique. Experimental results showed that the trained system achieved 0.36 in MRR and 0.47 in Top5 accuracy."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The conventional Question Answering (QA) architecture is a cascade of the following building blocks:","Question Analyzer analyzes a question sentence and identies the question types (or answer types).","Document Retriever retrieves documents related to the question from a large-scale document set.","Answer Candidate Extractor extracts answer candidates that match the question types from the retrieved documents.","Answer Selector ranks the answer candidates according to the syntactic and semantic conformity of each answer with the question and its context in the document.","Typically, question types consist of named entities, e.g., PERSON, DATE, and ORGANIZATION, numerical expressions, e.g., LENGTH, WEIGHT, SPEED, and class names, e.g., FLOWER, BIRD, and FOOD. The question type is also used for selecting answer candidates. For example, if the question type of a given question is PERSON, the answer candidate extractor lists only person names that are tagged as the named entity PERSON.","The conventional QA architecture has a drawback in that the question-type system restricts the range of questions that can be answered by the system. It is thus problematic for QA system developers to carefully design and build an answer candidate extractor that works well in conjunction with the question-type system. This problem is particularly difcult when the task is to develop a multilingual QA system to handle languages that are unfamiliar to the developer. Developing high-quality tools that can extract named entities, numerical expressions, and class names for each foreign language is very costly and time-consuming.","Recently, some pioneering studies have investigated approaches to automatically construct QA components from scratch by applying machine learning techniques to training data (Ittycheriah et al., 2001a)(Ittycheriah et al., 2001b)(Ng et al., 2001) (Pasca and Harabagiu)(Suzuki et al., 2002)(Suzuki 215","Table 1: Number of Questions in Question Types of CRL QA Data","# of Questions # of Question Types Example","1-9 74 AWARD, CRIME, OFFENSE 10-50 32 PERCENT, N PRODUCT, YEAR PERIOD 51-100 6 COUNTRY, COMPANY, GROUP 100-300 3 PERSON, DATE, MONEY Total 115 et al., 2003) (Zukerman and Horvitz, 2001)(Sasaki et al., 2004). These approaches still suffer from the problem of preparing an adequate amount of training data specically designed for a particular QA system because each QA system uses its own question-type system. It is very typical in the course of system development to redesign the question-type system in order to improve system performance. This inevitably leads to revision of a large-scale training dataset, which requires a heavy workload.","For example, assume that you have to develop a Chinese or Greek QA system and have 10,000 pairs of question and answers. You have to manually classify the questions according to your own question-type system. In addition, you have to annotate the tags of the question types to large-scale Chinese or Greek documents. If you wanted to redesign the question type ORGANIZATION to three categories, COMPANY, SCHOOL, and OTHER ORGANIZATION, then the ORGANIZATION tags in the annotated document set would need to be manually revisited and revised.","To solve this problem, this paper regards Question Answering as Question-Biased Term Extraction (QBTE). This new QBTE approach liberates QA systems from the heavy burden imposed by question types.","Since it is a challenging as well as a very complex and sensitive problem to directly extract answers without using question types and only using features of questions, correct answers, and contexts in documents, we have to investigate the feasibility of this approach: how well can answer candidates be extracted, and how well are answer candidates ranked?","In response, this paper employs the machine learning technique Maximum Entropy Models (MEMs) to extract answers to a question from documents based on question features, document features, and the combined features. Experimental results show the performance of a QA system that applies MEMs."]},{"title":"2 Preparation 2.1 Training Data Document Set","paragraphs":["Japanese newspaper articles of The Mainichi Newspaper published in 1995.","Question/Answer Set We used the CRL1","QA Data (Sekine et al., 2002).

Each question is categorized as one of 115 hierarchically classied question types.","The document set is used not only in the training phase but also in the execution phrase.","Although the CRL QA Data contains question types, the information of question types are not used for the training. This is because more than the 60% of question types have fewer than 10 questions as examples (Table 1). This means it is very unlikely that we can train a QA system that can handle this 60% due to data sparseness. 2","Only for the purpose of analyzing experimental results in this paper do we refer to the question types of the dataset. 2.2 Learning with Maximum Entropy Models This section briey introduces the machine learning technique Maximum Entropy Models and describes how to apply MEMs to QA tasks. 2.2.1 Maximum Entropy Models","Let X be a set of input symbols and Y be a set of class labels.

Answer candidate extraction is also a classication problem that classies words into answer types (i.e., question types), such as PERSON, DATE, and AWARD. Answer selection is an exactly classication that classies answer candidates as positive or negative. Therefore, we can apply machine learning techniques to generate classiers that work as components of a QA system.","In the QBTE approach, these three components, i.e., question analysis, answer candidate extraction, and answer selection, are integrated into one classier.","To successfully carry out this goal, we have to extract features that reect properties of correct answers of a question in the context of articles."]},{"title":"3 QBTE Model 1","paragraphs":["This section presents a framework, QBTE Model 1, to construct a QA system from question-answer pairs based on the QBTE Approach.

Automatic evaluation consists of exact matching and partial matching. Partial matching is useful for absorbing the variation in extraction range. A partial match is judged correct if a system’s answer completely includes the correct answer or the correct answer completely includes a system’s answer. Table 2 presents the experimental results. The results show that a QA system can be built by using our QBTE approach. The manually evaluated performance scored MRR=0.36 and Top5=0.47. However, manual evaluation is costly and time-consuming, so we use automatic evaluation results, i.e., exact matching results and partial matching results, as a pseudo lowerbound and upper-bound of the performances. Interestingly, the manual evaluation results of MRR and Top5 are nearly equal to the average between exact and partial evaluation.","To conrm that the QBTE ranks potential answers to the higher rank, we changed the number of paragraphs retrieved from a large corpus from N = 1, 3, 5 to 10.

This performance is comparable to the results of SAIQA-II (Sasaki et al., 2004) (MRR=0.4, Top5=0.55) whose question analysis, answer candidate extraction, and answer selection modules were independently built from a QA dataset and an NE dataset, which is limited to eight named entities, such as PERSON and LOCATION. Since the QA dataset is not publicly available, it is not possible to directly compare the experimental results; however we be-lieve that the performance of the QBTE Model 1 is comparable to that of the conventional approaches, even though it does not depend on question types, named entities, or class names.","Most of the partial answers were judged correct in manual evaluation. For example, for How many times bigger ...?, two times is a correct answer but two was judged correct. Suppose that John Kerry is a prepared correct answer in the CRL QA Data. In this case, Senator John Kerry would also be correct. Such additions and omissions occur because our approach is not restricted to particular extraction units, such as named entities or class names.","The performance of QBTE was affected little by the larger number of retrieved paragraphs, whereas the performances of TE and TE + QF signicantly degraded. This indicates that QBTE Model 1 is not mere Term Extraction with document retrieval but Term Extraction appropriately biased by questions.","Our experiments used no information about question types given in the CRL QA Data because we are seeking a universal method that can be used for any QA dataset. Beyond this main goal, as a reference, The Appendix shows our experimental results classied into question types without using them in the training phase. The results of automatic evaluation of complete matching are in Top5 (T5), and MRR and partial matching are in Top5 (T5’) and MRR’. It is interesting that minor question types were correctly answered, e.g., SEA and WEAPON, for which there was only one training question.","We also conducted an additional experiment, as a reference, on the training data that included question types dened in the CRL QA Data; the question-type of each question is added to the qw feature.

This approach requires no question type system, no named entity extractor, and no class name extractor. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has regarded Question Answering as Question-Biased Term Extraction. As a feasibility study, we built a QA system using Maximum Entropy Models on a 2000-question/answer dataset. The results were evaluated by 10-fold cross validation, which showed that the performance is 0.36 in MRR and 0.47 in Top5.
