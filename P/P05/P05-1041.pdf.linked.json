Considerable research in the eld of word sense disambiguation has concentrated on showing that the annotation of word senses can be done correctly and consistently, with the normal measure being inter-annotator agreement (e.g. Kilgariff and Rosenzweig, 2000). Surprisingly, few such studies have been carried out for syntactic annotation, with the notable exceptions of Brants et al. (2003, p 82) for the German NeGra Corpus and Civit et al. (2003) for the Spanish Cast3LB corpus. Even such valuable and widely used corpora as the Penn TreeBank have not been veried in this way.","We are constructing the Hinoki treebank as part of a larger project in cognitive and computational linguistics ultimately aimed at natural language understanding (Bond et al., 2004). In order to build the initial syntactic and semantic models, we are treebanking the dictionary denition sentences of the most familiar 28,000 words of Japanese and building an ontology from the results.","Arguably the most common method in building a treebank still is manual annotation, annotators (often linguistics students) marking up linguistic properties of words and phrases. In some semi-automated treebank efforts, annotators are aided by POS taggers or phrase-level chunkers, which can propose mark-up for manual conrmation, revision, or extension. As computational grammars and parsers have increased in coverage and accuracy, an alternate approach has become feasible, in which utterances are parsed and the annotator selects the best parse Carter (1997); Oepen et al. (2002) from the full analyses derived by the grammar.","We adopted the latter approach. There were four main reasons. The rst was that we wanted to develop a precise broad-coverage grammar in tandem with the treebank, as part of our research into natural language understanding. Treebanking the output of the parser allows us to immediately identify problems in the grammar, and improving the grammar directly improves the quality of the treebank in a mutually benecial feedback loop (Oepen et al., 2004). The second reason is that we wanted to annotate to a high level of detail, marking not only dependency and constituent structure but also detailed semantic relations. By using a Japanese grammar (JACY: Siegel and Bender, 2002) based on a monostratal theory of grammar (HPSG: Pollard and Sag, 1994) we could simultaneously annotate syntactic and semantic structure without overburdening the annota-330 tor. The third reason was that we expected the use of the grammar to aid in enforcing consistency at the very least all sentences annotated are guaranteed to have well-formed parses. The ip side to this is that any sentences which the parser cannot parse remain unannotated, at least unless we were to fall back on full manual mark-up of their analyses. The nal reason was that the discriminants can be used to update the treebank when the grammar changes, so that the treebank can be improved along with the grammar. This kind of dynamic, discriminant-based treebanking was pioneered in the Redwoods treebank of English (Oepen et al., 2002), so we refer to it as Redwoods-style treebanking.","In the next section, we give some more details about the Hinoki Treebank and the data used to evaluate the parser (x 2). This is followed by a brief discussion of treebanking using discriminants (x 3), and an extension to seed the treebanking using existing markup (x 4). Finally we present the results of our evaluation (x 5), followed by some discussion and outlines for future research."]},{"title":"2 The Hinoki Treebank","paragraphs":["The Hinoki treebank currently consists of around 95,000 annotated dictionary denition and example sentences. The dictionary is the Lexeed Semantic Database of Japanese (Kasahara et al., 2004), which consists of all words with a familiarity greater than or equal to ve on a scale of one to seven. This gives 28,000 words, divided into 46,347 different senses. Each sense has a denition sentence and example sentence written using only these 28,000 familiar words (and some function words). Many senses have more than one sentence in the denition: there are 81,000 dening sentences in all.","The data used in our evaluation is taken from the rst sentence of the denitions of all words with a familiarity greater than six (9,854 sentences). The Japanese grammar JACY was extended until the coverage was over 80% (Bond et al., 2004).","For evaluation of the treebanking we selected 5,000 of the sentences that could be parsed, and divided them into ve 1,000 sentence sets (AE).

These are (relatively) easy to judge by annotators. The system selects features that distinguish between different parses, and the annotator selects or rejects the features until only one parse is left. In a small number of cases, annotation may legitimately leave more than one parse active (see below). The system we used for treebanking was the [incr tsdb()] Redwoods environment2","(Oepen et al., 2002). The number of decisions for each sentence is proportional to the log of the number of parses. The number of decisions required depends on the ambiguity of the parses and the length of the input. For Hinoki, on average, the number of decisions presented to the annotator was 27.5. However, the average number of decisions needed to disambiguate each sentence was only 2.6, plus an additional decision to accept or reject the selected parses3",". In general, even a sentence with 100 parses requires only around 5 decisions and 1,000 parses only around 7 decisions. A graph of parse results versus number of decisions presented and required is given in Figure 6.","The primary data stored in the treebank is the derivation tree: the series of rules and lexical items the parser used to construct the parse. This, along with the grammar, can be combined to rebuild the complete HPSG sign. The annotators task is to select the appropriate derivation tree or trees.

One is lexical: aru a certain/have/be is ambiguous between a reading as a determiner a certain (det-lex) and its use as a verb of possession have (aru-verb-lex). If it is a verb, this gives rise to further structural ambiguity in the relative clause, as discussed in Section 2. Reliable POS tags can thus resolve some ambiguity, although not all.","Overall, this ve-word sentence has 6 parses. The annotator does not have to examine every tree but is instead presented with a range of 9 discriminants, as shown in Figure 4, each local to some segment of the utterance (word or phrase) and thus presenting a contrast that can be judged in isolation.

In such cases, the annotators were instructed to leave both parses.","Finally, the annotator has the option of rejecting all the parses presented, if none have the correct syntax and semantics. This decision has to be made even for sentences with a unique parse."]},{"title":"4 Using POS Tags to Blaze the Trees","paragraphs":["Sentences in the Lexeed dictionary were already part-of-speech tagged so we investigated exploiting this information to reduce the number of decisions the annotators had to make. More generally, there are many large corpora with a subset of the information we desire already available. For example, the Kyoto Corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao, 2003) has part of speech information and dependency information, but not the detailed information available from an HPSG analysis. However, the existing information can be used to blaze5","trees in the parse forest: that is to select or reject certain discriminants based on existing information.","Because other sources of information may not be entirely reliable, or the granularity of the information may be different from the granularity in our 5","In forestry, to blaze is to mark a tree, usually by painting and/or cutting the bark, indicating those to be cut or the course of a boundary, road, or trail. 333 treebank, we felt it was important that the blazes be defeasible. The annotator can always reject the blazed decisions and retag the sentence.","In [incr tsdb()], it is currently possible to blaze using POS information. The criteria for the blazing depend on both the grammar used to make the treebank and the POS tag set. The system matches the tagged POS against the grammar’s lexical hierarchy, using a one-to-many mapping of parts of speech to types of the grammar and a subsumption-based comparison. It is thus possible to write very general rules. Blazes can be positive to accept a discriminant or negative to reject it. The blaze markers are dened to be a POS tag, and then a list of lexical types and a score. The polarity of the score determines whether to accept or reject. The numerical value allows the use of a threshold, so that only those markers whose absolute value is greater than a threshold will be used. The threshold is currently set to zero: all blaze markers are used.","Due to the nature of discriminants, having two positively marked but competing discriminants for the same word will result in no trees satisfying the conditions. Therefore, it is important that only negative discriminants should be used for more general lexical types.","Hinoki uses 13 blaze markers at present, a simplied representation of them is shown in Figure 5. E.g. if hverb-aux, v-stem-lex, -1.0i was a blaze marker, then any sentence with a verb that has two non-auxiliary entries (e.g. hiraku/aku vt and vi) would be eliminated. The blaze set was derived from a conservative inspection of around 1,000 trees from an earlier round of annotation of similar data, identifying high-frequency contrasts in lexical ambiguity that can be condently blazed from the POS granularity available for Lexeed. POS tags Lexical Types in the Grammar Score verb-aux v-stem-lex −1.0 verb-main aspect-stem-lex −1.0 noun verb-stem-lex −1.0 adnominal noun mod-lex-l 0.9","det-lex 0.9 conjunction n conj-p-lex 0.9","v-coord-end-lex 0.9 adjectival-noun noun-lex −1.0 Figure 5: Some Blaze Markers used in Hinoki For the example shown in Figures 3 and 4, the blaze markers use the POS tagging of the determiner ","aru to mark it as det-lex. This eliminates four parses and six discriminants leaving only three to be presented to the annotator. On average, marking blazes reduced the average number of blazes presented per sentence from 27.5 to 23.8 (a reduction of 15.6%). A graphical view of number of discriminants versus parse ambiguity is shown in Figure 6."]},{"title":"5 Measuring Inter-Annotator Agreement","paragraphs":["Lacking a task-oriented evaluation scenario at this point, inter-annotator agreement is our core measure of annotation consistency in Hinoki. All trees (and associated semantics) in Hinoki are derived from a computational grammar and thus should be expected to demonstrate a basic degree of internal consistency. On the other hand, the use of the grammar exposes large amounts of ambiguity to annotators that might otherwise go unnoticed. It is therefore not a priori clear whether the Redwoods-style approach to treebank construction as a general methodology results in a high degree of internal consistency or a comparatively low one.","α β β γ γ α Average Parse Agreement 63.9 68.2 64.2 65.4 Reject Agreement 4.8 3.0 4.1 4.0 Parse Disagreement 17.5 19.2 17.9 18.2 Reject Disagreement 13.7 9.5 13.8 12.4 Table 1: Exact Match Inter-annotator Agreement","Table 1 quanties inter-annotator agreement in terms of the harshest possible measure, the proportion of sentences for which two annotators selected the exact same parse or both decided to reject all available parses. Each set was annotated by three annotators (α, β, γ). They were all native speakers of Japanese with a high score in a Japanese prociency test (Amano and Kondo, 1998) but no linguistic training. The average annotation speed was 50 sentences an hour.","In around 19 per cent of the cases annotators chose to not fully disambiguate, keeping two or even three active parses; for these we scored i","j , with j being the number of identical pairs in the cross-product of active parses, and i the number of mismatches. One annotator keeping f1, 2, 3g, for example, and another f3, 4g would be scored as 1","6 . In addition to 334 leaving residual ambiguity, annotators opted to reject all available parses in some eight per cent of cases, usually indicating opportunities for improvement of the underlying grammar. The Parse Agreement gures (65.4%) in Table 1 are those sentences where both annotators chose one or more parses, and they showed non-zero agreement. This gure is substantially above the published gure of 52% for NeGra Brants et al. (2003). Parse Disagreement is where both chose parses, but there was no agreement. Reject Agreement shows the proportion of sentences for which both annotators found no suitable analysis. Finally Reject Disagreement is those cases were one annotator found no suitable parses, but one selected one or more.","The striking contrast between the comparatively high exact match ratios (over a random choice baseline of below seven per cent; κ = 0.628) and the low agreement between annotators on which structures to reject completely suggests that the latter type of decision requires better guidelines, ideally tests that can be operationalized.","To obtain both a more ne-grained measure and also be able to compare to related work, we computed a labeled precision f-score over derivation trees. Note that our inventory of labels is large, as they correspond in granularity to structures of the grammar: close to 1,000 lexical and 120 phrase types. As there is no ‘gold’ standard in contrasting two annotations, our labeled constituent measure F is the harmonic mean of standard labeled precision P (Black et al., 1991; Civit et al., 2003) applied in both ‘directions’: for a pair of annotators α and β, F is dened as: F = 2P (α, β)P (β, α) P (α, β) + P (β, α) As found in the discussion of exact match inter-annotator agreement over the entire treebank, there are two fundamentally distinct types of decisions made by annotators, viz. (a) elimination of unwanted ambiguity and (b) the choice of keeping at least one analysis or rejecting the entire item. Of these, only (b) applies to items that are assigned only one parse by the grammar, hence we omit unambiguous items from our labeled precision measures (a little more than twenty per cent of the total) to exclude trivial agreement from the comparison. In the same spirit, to eliminate noise hidden in pairs of items where one or both annotators opted for multiple valid parses, we further reduced the comparison set to those pairs where both annotators opted for exactly one active parse. Intersecting both conditions for pairs of annotators leaves us with subsets of around 2,500 sentences each, for which we record F values ranging from 95.1 to 97.4, see Table 2. When broken down by pairs of annotators and sets of 1,000 items each, which have been annotated in strict sequential order, F scores in Table 2 conrm that: (a) inter-annotator agreement is stable, all three annotators appear to have performed equally (well); (b) with growing experience, there is a slight increase in F scores over time, particularly when taking into account that set E exhibits a noticeably higher average ambiguity rate (1208 parses per item) than set D (820 average parses); and (c) Hinoki inter-annotator agreement compares favorably to results reported for the German NeGra (Brants, 2000) and Spanish Cast3LB (Civit et al., 2003) treebanks, both of which used manual mark-up seeded from automated POS tagging and chunking.","Compared to the 92.43 per cent labeled F score reported by Brants (2000), Hinoki achieves an ‘error’ (i.e. disagreement) rate of less than half, even though our structures are richer in information and should probably be contrasted with the ‘edge label’ F score for NeGra, which is 88.53 per cent. At the same time, it is unknown to what extent results are inuenced by differences in text genre, i.e. average sentence length of our dictionary denitions is noticeably shorter than for the NeGra newspaper corpus. In addition, our measure is computed only over a subset of the corpus (those trees that can be parsed and that had multiple parses which were not rejected). If we recalculate over all 5,000 sentences, including rejected sentences (F measure of 0) and those with no ambiguity (F measure of 1) then the average F measure is 83.5, slightly worse than the score for NeGra. However, the annotation process itself identies which the problematic sentences are, and how to improve the agreement: improve the grammar so that fewer sentences need to be rejected and then update the annotation. The Hinoki treebank is, by design, dynamic, so we expect to continue to improve the grammar and annotation continuously over the project’s lifetime. 335 Test α β β γ γ α Average Set # F # F # F F A 507 96.03 516 96.22 481 96.24 96.19 B 505 96.79 551 96.40 511 96.57 96.58 C 489 95.82 517 95.15 477 95.42 95.46 D 454 96.83 477 96.86 447 97.40 97.06 E 480 95.15 497 96.81 484 96.57 96.51","2435 96.32 2558 96.28 2400 96.47 96.36 Table 2: Inter-Annotator Agreement as Mutual Labeled Precision F-Score Test Annotator Decisions Blazed Set α β γ Decisions A 2,659 2,606 3,045 416 B 2,848 2,939 2,253 451 C 1,930 2,487 2,882 468 D 2,254 2,157 2,347 397 E 1,769 2,278 1,811 412 Table 3: Number of Decisions Required 5.1 The Effects of Blazing Table 3 shows the number of decisions per annotator, including revisions, and the number of decisions that can be done automatically by the part-of-speech blazed markers.

In order to evaluate the effect of the blazes, we compared the average number of decisions per sentence for the test sets in which some annotators used blazes and some did not (BD). The average number of decisions went from 2.63 to 2.11, a substantial reduction of 19.5%. similarly, the time required to annotate an utterance was reduced from 83 seconds per sentence to 70, a speed up of 15.7%. We did not include A and E, as there was variation in difculty between test sets, and it is well known that annotators improve (at least in speed of annotation) over time. Research on other projects has shown that it is normal for learning curve differences to swamp differences in tools (Wallis, 2003, p. 65).

This shows that the most important consideration for the success of treebanking in this manner is the quality of the grammar. Fortunately, treebanking offers direct feedback to the grammar developers. Rejected sentences identify which areas need to be improved, and be-cause the treebank is dynamic, it can be improved when we improve the analyses in the grammar. This is a notable improvement over semi-automatically constructed grammars, such as the Penn Treebank, where many inconsistencies remain (around 4,500 types estimated by Dickinson and Meurers, 2003) and the treebank does not allow them to be identied automatically or easily updated.","Because we are simultaneously using the semantic output of the grammar in building an ontology, and the syntax and semantics are tightly coupled, the knowledge acquisition provides a further route for feedback. Extracting an ontology from the semantic representations revealed many issues with the semantics that had previously been neglected.","Our top priority for further work within Hinoki 336 is to improve the grammar so as to both increase the cover and decrease the number of results with no acceptable parses. This will allow us to treebank a higher proportion of sentences, with even higher precision.","For more general work on treebank construction, we would like to investigate (1) using other information for blazes (syntactic constituents, dependencies, translation data) and marking blazes automatically using condent scores from existing POS taggers or parsers, (2) other agreement measures (for example agreement over the semantic representations), (3) presenting discriminants based on the semantic representations."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We conducted an experiment to measure inter-annotator agreement for the Hinoki corpus.
