Additionally, generalization based on verb classification is central to many NL applications, ranging from shallow semantic parsing to semantic search or information extrac-tion. Currently, a lot of interest has been paid to two verb categorization schemes: VerbNet (Schuler, 2005) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), which has also fostered production of many automatic approaches to predicate argument extraction.","Such work has shown that syntax is necessary for helping to predict the roles of verb arguments and consequently their verb sense (Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2005; Gildea and Palmer, 2002). However, the definition of models for optimally combining lexical and syntactic constraints is still far for being accomplished. In particular, the exhaustive design and experimentation of lexical and syntactic features for learning verb classification appears to be computationally problematic. For example, the verb order can belongs to the two VerbNet classes: – The class 60.1, i.e., order someone to do something as shown in: The Illinois Supreme Court ordered the commission to audit Commonwealth Edison ’s construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses . – The class 13.5.1: order or request something like in: ... Michelle blabs about it to a sandwich man while ordering lunch over the phone . Clearly, the syntactic realization can be used to discern the cases above but it would not be enough to correctly classify the following verb occurrence: .. ordered the lunch to be delivered .. in Verb class 13.5.1. For such a case, selectional restrictions are needed. These have also been shown to be useful for semantic role classification (Zapirain et al., 2010). Note that their coding in learning algorithms is rather complex: we need to take into account syntactic structures, which may require an exponential number of syntactic features (i.e., all their possible substructures). Moreover, these have to be enriched with lexical information to trig lexical preference.","In this paper, we tackle the problem above by studying innovative representations for automatic verb classification according to VerbNet and FrameNet. We define syntactic and semantic structures capturing essential lexical and syntactic properties of verbs. Then, we apply similarity between 263 such structures, i.e., kernel functions, which can also exploit distributional lexical semantics, to train automatic classifiers. The basic idea of such functions is to compute the similarity between two verbs in terms of all the possible substructures of their syntactic frames. We define and automatically extract a lexicalized approximation of the latter. Then, we apply kernel functions that jointly model structural and lexical similarity so that syntactic properties are combined with generalized lexemes. The nice property of kernel functions is that they can be used in place of the scalar product of feature vectors to train algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This way SVMs can learn the association between syntactic (sub-) structures whose lexical arguments are generalized and target verb classes, i.e., they can also learn selectional restrictions.","We carried out extensive experiments on verb class and frame detection which showed that our models greatly improve on the state-of-the-art (up to about 13% of relative error reduction). Such results are nicely assessed by manually inspecting the most important substructures used by the classifiers as they largely correlate with syntactic frames defined in VerbNet.","In the rest of the paper, Sec. 2 reports on related work, Sec. 3 and Sec. 4 describe previous and our models for syntactic and semantic similarity, respectively, Sec. 5 illustrates our experiments, Sec. 6 discusses the output of the models in terms of error analysis and important structures and finally Sec. 7 derives the conclusions."]},{"title":"2 Related work","paragraphs":["Our target task is verb classification but at the same time our models exploit distributional models as well as structural kernels. The next three subsections report related work in such areas. Verb Classification. The introductory verb classification example has intuitively shown the complexity of defining a comprehensive feature representation. Hereafter, we report on analysis carried out in previous work.","It has been often observed that verb senses tend to show different selectional constraints in a specific argument position and the above verb order is a clear example. In the direct object position of the example sentence for the first sense 60.1 oforder, we found commission in the role PATIENT of the predicate. It clearly satisfies the +ANIMATE/+ORGANIZATION restriction on the PATIENT role. This is not true for the direct object dependency of the alternative sense 13.5.1, which usually expresses the THEME role, with unrestricted type selection. When properly generalized, the direct object information has thus been shown highly predictive about verb sense distinctions.","In (Brown et al., 2011), the so called dynamic dependency neighborhoods (DDN), i.e., the set of verbs that are typically collocated with a direct object, are shown to be more helpful than lexical information (e.g., WordNet). The set of typical verbs taking a noun n as a direct object is in fact a strong characterization for semantic similarity, as all the nouns m similar to n tend to collocate with the same verbs. This is true also for other syntactic dependencies, among which the direct object dependency is possibly the strongest cue (as shown for example in (Dligach and Palmer, 2008)).","In order to generalize the above DDN feature, distributional models are ideal, as they are designed to model all the collocations of a given noun, according to large scale corpus analysis. Their ability to capture lexical similarity is well established in WSD tasks (e.g. (Schutze, 1998)), thesauri harvest-ing (Lin, 1998), semantic role labeling (Croce et al., 2010)) as well as information retrieval (e.g. (Furnas et al., 1988)). Distributional Models (DMs). These models follow the distributional hypothesis (Firth, 1957) and characterize lexical meanings in terms of context of use, (Wittgenstein, 1953). By inducing geometrical notions of vectors and norms through corpus analysis, they provide a topological definition of semantic similarity, i.e., distance in a space. DMs can capture the similarity between words such as delegation, deputation or company and commission. In case of sense 60.1 of the verb order, DMs can be used to suggest that the role PATIENT can be inherited by all these words, as suitable Organisations.","In supervised language learning, when few examples are available, DMs support cost-effective lexical generalizations, often outperforming knowledge based resources (such as WordNet, as in (Pantel et al., 2007)). Obviously, the choice of the context 264 type determines the type of targeted semantic properties. Wider contexts (e.g., entire documents) are shown to suggest topical relations. Smaller contexts tend to capture more specific semantic as-pects, e.g. the syntactic behavior, and better capture paradigmatic relations, such as synonymy. In particular, word space models, as described in (Sahlgren, 2006), define contexts as the words appearing in a n-sized window, centered around a target word. Cooccurrence counts are thus collected in a words-by-words matrix, where each element records the number of times two words co-occur within a single window of word tokens. Moreover, robust weighting schemas are used to smooth counts against too frequent co-occurrence pairs: Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) scores (Turney and Pantel, 2010) are commonly adopted. Structural Kernels. Tree and sequence kernels have been successfully used in many NLP applications, e.g., parse reranking and adaptation, (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Shen et al., 2003; Toutanova et al., 2004; Kudo et al., 2005; Titov and Henderson, 2006), chunking and dependency parsing, e.g., (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2003; Daumé III and Marcu, 2004), named entity recognition, (Cumby and Roth, 2003), text categorization, e.g., (Cancedda et al., 2003; Gliozzo et al., 2005), and relation extraction, e.g., (Zelenko et al., 2002; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Zhang et al., 2006).","Recently, DMs have been also proposed in in-tegrated syntactic-semantic structures that feed advanced learning functions, such as the semantic tree kernels discussed in (Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007a; Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007b; Mehdad et al., 2010; Croce et al., 2011)."]},{"title":"3 Structural Similarity Functions","paragraphs":["In this paper we model verb classifiers by exploiting previous technology for kernel methods. In particular, we design new models for verb classification by adopting algorithms for structural similarity, known as Smoothed Partial Tree Kernels (SPTKs) (Croce et al., 2011). We define new innovative structures and similarity functions based on LSA.","The main idea of SPTK is rather simple: (i) measuring the similarity between two trees in terms of the number of shared subtrees; and (ii) such number also includes similar fragments whose lexical nodes are just related (so they can be different). The contribution of (ii) is proportional to the lexical similarity of the tree lexical nodes, where the latter can be evaluated according to distributional models or also lexical resources, e.g., WordNet.","In the following, we define our models based on previous work on LSA and SPTKs. 3.1 LSA as lexical similarity model Robust representations can be obtained through intelligent dimensionality reduction methods. In LSA the original word-by-context matrix M is de-composed through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Golub and Kahan, 1965) into the product of three new matrices: U , S, and V so that S is diagonal and M = U SV T",". M is then approximated by Mk = UkSkV T","k , where only the first k columns of U and V are used, corresponding to the first k greatest singular values. This approximation supplies a way to project a generic term wi into the k-dimensional space using W = UkS","1/2","k , where each row corresponds to the representation vectors ⃗wi. The original statistical information about M is captured by the new k-dimensional space, which preserves the global structure while removing low-variant dimensions, i.e., distribution noise. Given two words w1 and w2, the term similarity function σ is estimated as the cosine similarity between the corresponding projections ⃗w1, ⃗w2 in the LSA space, i.e σ(w1, w2) =","⃗w1· ⃗w2 ∥ ⃗w1∥∥ ⃗w2∥ . This is known as Latent Semantic Kernel (LSK), proposed in (Cristianini et al., 2001), as it defines a positive semi-definite Gram matrix G = σ(w1, w2) ∀w1, w2 (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004). σ is thus a valid kernel and can be combined with other kernels, as discussed in the next session. 3.2 Tree Kernels driven by Semantic Similarity To our knowledge, two main types of tree kernels exploit lexical similarity: the syntactic semantic tree kernel defined in (Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007a) applied to constituency trees and the smoothed partial tree kernels (SPTKs) defined in (Croce et al., 2011), which generalizes the former. We report the definition of the latter as we modified it for our purposes. SPTK computes the number of common substructures between two trees T1 and T2 without explicitly considering the whole fragment space.

The ∆ function determines the richness of the kernel space and thus induces different tree kernels, for example, the syntactic tree kernel (STK) (Collins and Duffy, 2002) or the partial tree kernel (PTK) (Moschitti, 2006).","The algorithm for SPTK’s ∆ is the following: if n1 and n2 are leaves then ∆σ(n1, n2) = μλσ(n1, n2); else ∆σ(n1, n2) = μσ(n1, n2) × ( λ2","+ ∑ ⃗I1,⃗I2,l(⃗I1)=l(⃗I2) λd(⃗I1)+d(⃗I2) l(⃗I1) ∏ j=1 ∆σ(cn1(⃗I1j), cn2(⃗I2j)) ) , (2) where (1) σ is any similarity between nodes, e.g., between their lexical labels; (2) λ, μ ∈ [0, 1] are decay factors; (3) cn1(h) is the hth","child of the node n","1;","(4) ⃗I1 and ⃗I2 are two sequences of indexes, i.e., ⃗I =","(i1, i2, .., l(I)), with 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < .. < il(I); and (5)","d(⃗I1) = ⃗I1l(⃗I1)−⃗I11+1 and d(⃗I2) = ⃗I2l(⃗I2)−⃗I21+1.","Note that, as shown in (Croce et al., 2011), the av-","erage running time of SPTK is sub-quadratic in the","number of the tree nodes.

We also modified SPTK to apply different similarity functions to different nodes to introduce flexibility. 4.1 Verb Structural Representation The implicit feature space generated by structural kernels and the corresponding notion of similarity between verbs obviously depends on the input structures. In the cases of STK, PTK and SPTK different tree representations lead to engineering more or less expressive linguistic feature spaces.","With the aim of capturing syntactic features, we started from two different parsing paradigms: phrase and dependency structures. For example, for representing the first example of the introduction, we can use the constituency tree (CT) in Figure 1, where the target verb node is enriched with the TARGET label. Here, we apply tree pruning to reduce the computational complexity of tree kernels as it is proportional to the number of nodes in the input trees. Accordingly, we only keep the subtree dominated by the target VP by pruning from it all the S-nodes along with their subtrees (i.e, all nested sentences are removed). To further improve generalization, we lemmatize lexical nodes and add generalized POS-Tags, i.e., noun (n::), verb (v::), adjective (::a), determiner (::d) and so on, to them. This is useful for constrain-ing similarity to be only contributed by lexical pairs of the same grammatical category. 266 TARGET-order::v VBDROOTto::t TOOPRDaudit::v VBIM commission::n NNOBJthe::d DTNMOD court::n NNPSBJsupreme::n NNPNMOD illinois::n NNPNMOD the::d DTNMOD Figure 3: Representation of verbs according to the Lexical Centered Tree (LCT)","To encode dependency structure information in a tree (so that we can use it in tree kernels), we use (i) lexemes as nodes of our tree, (ii) their dependencies as edges between the nodes and (iii) the dependency labels, e.g., grammatical functions (GR), and POS-Tags, again as tree nodes. We designed two different tree types: (i) in the first type, GR are central nodes from which dependencies are drawn and all the other features of the central node, i.e., lexical surface form and its POS-Tag, are added as additional children. An example of the GR Centered Tree (GRCT) is shown in Figure 2, where the POS-Tags and lexemes are children of GR nodes. (ii) The second type of tree uses lexicals as central nodes on which both GR and POS-Tag are added as the right-most children. For example, Figure 3 shows an example of a Lexical Centered Tree (LCT). For both trees, the pruning strategy only preserves the verb node, its direct ancestors (father and siblings) and its descendants up to two levels (i.e., direct children and grandchildren of the verb node). Note that, our dependency tree can capture the semantic head of the verbal argument along with the main syntactic construct, e.g., to audit. 4.2 Generalized node similarity for SPTK We have defined the new similarityστ to be used in Eq. 2, which makes SPTK more effective as shown by Alg. 1. στ takes two nodes n1 and n2 and applies a different similarity for each node type. The latter is derived by τ and can be: GR (i.e., SYNT), POS-Tag (i.e., POS) or a lexical (i.e., LEX) type. In our experiment, we assign 0/1 similarity for SYNT and POS nodes according to string matching. For LEX type, we apply a lexical similarity learned with LSA to only pairs of lexicals associated with the same POS-Tag. It should be noted that the type-based similarity allows for potentially applying a different similarity for each node. Indeed, we also tested an amplifica-tion factor, namely, leaf weight (lw), which amplifies the matching values of the leaf nodes.

We also compared with simple bag-of-words (BOW) models and the state-of-the-art. 5.1 General experimental setup We consider two different corpora: one for VerbNet and the other for FrameNet. For the former, we used the same verb classification setting of (Brown et al., 2011). Sentences are drawn from the Semlink corpus (Loper et al., 2007), which consists of the Prop-Banked Penn Treebank portions of the Wall Street Journal. It contains 113K verb instances, 97K of which are verbs represented in at least one VerbNet class. Semlink includes 495 verbs, whose instances are labeled with more than one class (including one single VerbNet class or none). We used all instances of the corpus for a total of 45,584 instances for 180 verb classes. When instances labeled with the none class are not included, the number of examples be-comes 23,719.","The second corpus refers to FrameNet frame classification. The training and test data are drawn from the FrameNet 1.5 corpus2",", which consists of 135K sentences annotated according the frame semantics 2 http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu 267 (Baker et al., 1998). We selected the subset of frames containing more than 100 sentences annotated with a verbal predicate for a total of 62,813 sentences in 187 frames (i.e., very close to the VerbNet datasets). For both the datasets, we used 70% of instances for training and 30% for testing.","Our verb (multi) classifier is designed with the one-vs-all (Rifkin and Klautau, 2004) multi-classification schema. This uses a set of binary SVM classifiers, one for each verb class (frame) i. The sentences whose verb is labeled with the class i are positive examples for the classifieri. The sentences whose verbs are compatible with the class i but evoking a different class or labeled with none (no current verb class applies) are added as negative examples. In the classification phase the binary classifiers are applied by (i) only considering classes that are compatible with the target verbs; and (ii) select-ing the class associated with the maximum positive SVM margin. If all classifiers provide a negative score the example is labeled with none.","To learn the binary classifiers of the schema above, we coded our modified SPTK in SVM-Light-TK3","(Moschitti, 2006). The parameterization of each classifier is carried on a held-out set (30% of the training) and is concerned with the setting of the trade-off parameter (option -c) and the leaf weight (lw) (see Alg. 1), which is used to linearly scale the contribution of the leaf nodes. In contrast, the cost-factor parameter of SVM-Light-TK is set as the ratio between the number of negative and positive examples for attempting to have a balanced Precision/Recall.","Regarding SPTK setting, we used the lexical similarity σ defined in Sec. 3.1. In more detail, LSA was applied to ukWak (Baroni et al., 2009), which is a large scale document collection made up of 2 billion tokens. M is constructed by applying POS tagging to build rows with pairs ⟨lemma, ::POS⟩ (lemma::POS in brief). The contexts of such items are the columns of M and are short windows of size [−3, +3], centered on the items. This allows for better capturing syntactic properties of words. The most frequent 20,000 items are selected along with their 20k contexts.

In contrast, STK applied to our representation (CT, GRCT and LCT) produces comparable accuracy, e.g., 84.83, confirming that syntactic representation is needed to reach the state-of-the-art.","Third, PTK, which produces more general structures, improves over BR by almost 1.5 (statistically significant result) when using our dependency structures GRCT and LCT. CT does not produce the same improvement since it does not allow PTK to directly compare the lexical structure (lexemes are all leaf nodes in CT and to connect some pairs of them very large trees are needed).","Finally, the best model of SPTK (i.e, using LCT) improves over the best PTK (i.e., using LCT) by almost 1 point (statistically significant result): this difference is only given by lexical similarity. SPTK improves on the state-of-the-art by about 2.08 absolute percent points, which, given the high accuracy of the baseline, corresponds to 13.5% of relative error reduction.","We carried out similar experiments for frame classification. One interesting difference is that SK improves BOW by only 0.70, i.e., 4 times less than in the VerbNet setting. This suggests that word order around the predicate is more important for deriving the VerbNet class than the FrameNet frame. Additionally, LCT or GRCT seems to be invariant for both PTK and SPTK whereas the lexical similarity still produces a relevant improvement on PTK, i.e., 13% of relative error reduction, for an absolute accuracy of 93.78%.

This may suggest that SPTK can help in complex settings, where verb class characterization is more difficult. Another important role of SPTK models is their ability to generalize. To test this aspect, Figure 4 illustrates the learning curves of SPTK with respect to BOW and the accuracy achieved by BR (with a constant line).

Many mistakes are related to false positives and negatives of the none class (about 72% of the errors). This class also causes data imbalance. Most errors are also due to lack of lexical information available to the SPTK kernel: (i) in 30% of the errors, the argument heads were proper nouns for which the lexical generalization provided by the DMs was not 5 http://danielepighin.net/cms/software/flink 269 VerbNet class 13.5.1 (IM(VB(target))(OBJ)) (VC(VB(target))(OBJ)) (VC(VBG(target))(OBJ)) (OPRD(TO)(IM(VB(target))(OBJ))) (PMOD(VBG(target))(OBJ)) (VB(target)) (VC(VBN(target))) (PRP(TO)(IM(VB(target))(OBJ))) (IM(VB(target))(OBJ)(ADV(IN)(PMOD))) (OPRD(TO)(IM(VB(target))(OBJ)(ADV(IN)(PMOD)))) VerbNet class 60 (VC(VB(target))(OBJ)) (NMOD(VBG(target))(OPRD)) (VC(VBN(target))(OPRD)) (NMOD(VBN(target))(OPRD)) (PMOD(VBG(target))(OBJ)) (ROOT(SBJ)(VBD(target))(OBJ)(P(,))) (VC(VB(target))(OPRD)) (ROOT(SBJ)(VBZ(target))(OBJ)(P(,))) (NMOD(SBJ(WDT))(VBZ(target))(OPRD)) (NMOD(SBJ)(VBZ(target))(OPRD(SBJ)(TO)(IM))) Table 4: GRCT fragments available; and (ii) in 76% of the errors only 2 or less argument heads are included in the extracted tree, therefore tree kernels cannot exploit enough lexical information to disambiguate verb senses. Additionally, ambiguity characterizes errors where the system is linguistically consistent but the learned selectional preferences are not sufficient to separate verb senses. These errors are mainly due to the lack of contextual information. While error analysis suggests that further improvement is possible (e.g. by exploiting proper nouns), the type of generalizations currently achieved by SPTK are rather effective. Table 4 and 5 report the tree structures characterizing the most informative training examples of the two senses of the verb order, i.e. the VerbNet classes 13.5.1 (make a request for something) and 60 (give instructions to or direct somebody to do something with authority).","In line with the method discussed in (Pighin and Moschitti, 2009b), these fragments are extracted as they appear in most of the support vectors selected during SVM training. As easily seen, the two classes are captured by rather different patterns. The typical accusative form with an explicit direct object emerges as characterizing the sense 13.5.1, denot-ing the THEME role. All fragments of the sense 60 emphasize instead the sentential complement of the verb that in fact expresses the standard PROPOSI-TION role in VerbNet. Notice that tree fragments correspond to syntactic patterns. The a posteriori VerbNet class 13.5.1 (VP(VB(target))(NP)) (VP(VBG(target))(NP)) (VP(VBD(target))(NP)) (VP(TO)(VP(VB(target))(NP))) (S(NP-SBJ)(VP(VBP(target))(NP))) VerbNet class 60 (VBN(target)) (VP(VBD(target))(S)) (VP(VBZ(target))(S)) (VBP(target)) (VP(VBD(target))(NP-1)(S(NP-SBJ)(VP))) Table 5: CT fragments analysis of the learned models (i.e. the underlying support vectors) confirm very interesting grammatical generalizations, i.e. the capability of tree kernels to implicitly trigger useful linguistic inductions for complex semantic tasks. When SPTK are adopted, verb arguments can be lexically generalized into word classes, i.e., clusters of argument heads (e.g. commission vs. delegation, or gift vs. present). Automatic generation of such classes is an interesting direction for future research."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have proposed new approaches to characterize verb classes in learning algorithms. The key idea is the use of structural representation of verbs based on syntactic dependencies and the use of structural kernels to measure similarity between such representations. The advantage of kernel methods is that they can be directly used in some learning algorithms, e.g., SVMs, to train verb classifiers. Very interestingly, we can encode distributional lexical similarity in the similarity function acting over syntactic structures and this allows for generalizing selection restrictions through a sort of (supervised) syntactic and semantic co-clustering.","The verb classification results show a large improvement over the state-of-the-art for both VerbNet and FrameNet, with a relative error reduction of about 13.5% and 16.0%, respectively. In the future, we plan to exploit the models learned from FrameNet and VerbNet to carry out automatic mapping of verbs from one theory to the other.
