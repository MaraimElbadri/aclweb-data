In order to adapt to this phenomenon, several semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms, which learn from labeled as well as unlabeled data, have been developed. In a separate line of work, researchers have started to realize that graphs provide a natural way to represent data in a variety of domains. Graph-based SSL algorithms, which bring together these two lines of work, have been shown to outperform the state-of-the-art in many applications in speech processing, computer vision and NLP. In particular, recent NLP research has successfully used graph-based SSL algorithms for PoS tagging (Subramanya et al., 2010), semantic parsing (Das and Smith, 2011), knowledge acquisition (Talukdar et al., 2008), sentiment analysis (Goldberg and Zhu, 2006) and text categorization (Subramanya and Bilmes, 2008). Recognizing this promising and emerging area of research, this tutorial focuses on graph-based SSL algorithms (e.g., label propagation methods). The tutorial is intended to be a sequel to the ACL 2008 SSL tutorial, focusing exclusively on graph-based SSL methods and recent advances in this area, which were beyond the scope of the previous tutorial. The tutorial is divided in two parts. In the first part, we will motivate the need for graph-based SSL methods, introduce some standard graph-based SSL algorithms, and discuss connections between these approaches. We will also discuss how linguistic data can be encoded as graphs and show how graph-based algorithms can be scaled to large amounts of data (e.g., web-scale data). Part 2 of the tutorial will focus on how graph-based methods can be used to solve several critical NLP tasks, including basic problems such as PoS tagging, semantic parsing, and more downstream tasks such as text categorization, information acquisition, and sentiment analysis. We will conclude the tutorial with some exciting avenues for future work.","Familiarity with semi-supervised learning and","graph-based methods will not be assumed, and the","necessary background will be provided. Examples","from NLP tasks will be used throughout the tutorial","to convey the necessary concepts. At the end of this","tutorial, the attendee will walk away with the follow-","ing: • An in-depth knowledge of the current state-of-","the-art in graph-based SSL algorithms, and the","ability to implement them. • The ability to decide on the suitability of","graph-based SSL methods for a problem. • Familiarity with different NLP tasks where","graph-based SSL methods have been success-","fully applied. In addition to the above goals, we hope that this tutorial will better prepare the attendee to conduct exciting research at the intersection of NLP and other emerging areas with natural graph-structured data (e.g., Computation Social Science).
