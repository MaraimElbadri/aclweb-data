In this paper we address the problem of learning transitive graphs that describe entailment rules between predicates (termed entailment graphs). We first identify that entailment graphs exhibit a “tree-like” property and are very similar to a novel type of graph termed forest-reducible graph. We utilize this property to develop an iterative efficient approximation algorithm for learning the graph edges, where each iteration takes linear time. We compare our approximation algorithm to a recently-proposed state-of-the-art exact algorithm and show that it is more efficient and scalable both theoretically and empirically, while its output quality is close to that given by the optimal solution of the exact algorithm."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Performing textual inference is in the heart of many semantic inference applications such as Question Answering (QA) and Information Extraction (IE). A prominent generic paradigm for textual inference is Textual Entailment (TUE) (Dagan et al., 2009). In TUE, the goal is to recognize, given two text fragments termed text and hypothesis, whether the hypothesis can be inferred from the text. For example, the text “Cyprus was invaded by the Ottoman Empire in 1571” implies the hypothesis “The Ottomans attacked Cyprus”.","Semantic inference applications such as QA and IE crucially rely on entailment rules (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama and Sekine, 2006) or equivalently inference rules, that is, rules that describe a directional inference relation between two fragments of text. An important type of entailment rule specifies the entailment relation between natural language predicates, e.g., the entailment rule ‘X invade Y → X attack Y’ can be helpful in inferring the aforementioned hypothesis. Consequently, substantial effort has been made to learn such rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Sekine, 2005; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008; Schoenmackers et al., 2010).","Textual entailment is inherently a transitive relation , that is, the rules ‘x → y’ and ‘y → z’ imply the rule ‘x → z’. Accordingly, Berant et al. (2010) formulated the problem of learning entailment rules as a graph optimization problem, where nodes are predicates and edges represent entailment rules that respect transitivity. Since finding the optimal set of edges respecting transitivity is NP-hard, they employed Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to find the exact solution. Indeed, they showed that applying global transitivity constraints improves rule learning comparing to methods that ignore graph structure. More recently, Berant et al. (Berant et al., 2011) in-troduced a more efficient exact algorithm, which decomposes the graph into connected components and then applies an ILP solver over each component.","Despite this progress, finding the exact solution remains NP-hard – the authors themselves report they were unable to solve some graphs of rather moderate size and that the coverage of their method is limited. Thus, scaling their algorithm to data sets with tens of thousands of predicates (e.g., the extractions of Fader et al. (2011)) is unlikely. 117","In this paper we present a novel method for learning the edges of entailment graphs. Our method computes much more efficiently an approximate solution that is empirically almost as good as the exact solution. To that end, we first (Section 3) conjecture and empirically show that entailment graphs exhibit a “tree-like” property, i.e., that they can be reduced into a structure similar to a directed forest.","Then, we present in Section 4 our iterative approximation algorithm, where in each iteration a node is removed and re-attached back to the graph in a locally-optimal way. Combining this scheme with our conjecture about the graph structure enables a linear algorithm for node re-attachment. Section 5 shows empirically that this algorithm is by orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art exact algorithm, and that though an optimal solution is not guaranteed, the area under the precision-recall curve drops by merely a point.","To conclude, the contribution of this paper is two-fold: First, we define a novel modeling assumption about the tree-like structure of entailment graphs and demonstrate its validity. Second, we exploit this assumption to develop a polynomial approximation algorithm for learning entailment graphs that can scale to much larger graphs than in the past. Finally, we note that learning entailment graphs bears strong similarities to related tasks such as Taxonomy Induction (Snow et al., 2006) and Ontology induction (Poon and Domingos, 2010), and thus our approach may improve scalability in these fields as well."]},{"title":"2 Background","paragraphs":["Until recently, work on learning entailment rules between predicates considered each rule independently of others and did not exploit global dependencies. Most methods utilized the distributional similarity hypothesis that states that semantically similar predicates occur with similar arguments (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Szpektor et al., 2004; Yates and Etzioni, 2009; Schoenmackers et al., 2010). Some methods extracted rules from lexicographic resources such as WordNet (Szpektor and Dagan, 2009) or FrameNet (Bob and Rambow, 2009; Ben Aharon et al., 2010), and others assumed that semantic relations between predicates can be deduced from their co-occurrence in a corpus via manually-constructed patterns (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).","Recently, Berant et al. (2010; 2011) formulated the problem as the problem of learning global entailment graphs. In entailment graphs, nodes are predicates (e.g., ‘X attack Y’) and edges represent entailment rules between them (‘X invade Y → X attack Y’). For every pair of predicates i, j, an entailment score wij was learned by training a classifier over distributional similarity features. A positive wij indicated that the classifier believes i → j and a nega-tive wij indicated that the classifier believes i ↛ j. Given the graph nodes V (corresponding to the predicates) and the weighting function w : V × V → R, they aim to find the edges of a graph G = (V, E) that maximize the objective","∑","(i,j)∈E wij under the constraint that the graph is transitive (i.e., for every node triplet (i, j, k), if (i, j) ∈ E and (j, k) ∈ E, then (i, k) ∈ E).","Berant et al. proved that this optimization problem, which we term Max-Trans-Graph, is NP-hard, and so described it as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). Let xij be a binary variable indicating the existence of an edge i → j in E. Then, X = {xij : i ̸= j} are the variables of the following ILP for Max-Trans-Graph:","arg max","X ∑ i̸=j wij · xij (1) s.t. ∀i,j,k∈V xij + xjk − xik ≤ 1 ∀i,j∈V xij ∈ {0, 1} The objective function is the sum of weights over the edges of G and the constraint xij + xjk − xik ≤ 1 on the binary variables enforces that whenever xij = xjk = 1, then also xik = 1 (transitivity).","Since ILP is NP-hard, applying an ILP solver directly does not scale well because the number of variables is O(|V |2",") and the number of constraints is O(|V |3","). Thus, even a graph with ∼80 nodes (predicates) has more than half a million constraints. Consequently, in (Berant et al., 2011), they proposed a method that efficiently decomposes the graph into smaller components and applies an ILP solver on each component separately using a cutting-plane procedure (Riedel and Clarke, 2006). Although this method is exact and improves scalability, it does not guarantee an efficient solution. When the graph does not decompose into sufficiently small components, and the weights generate many violations of 118 transitivity, solving Max-Trans-Graph becomes in-tractable. To address this problem, we present in this paper a method for approximating the optimal set of edges within each component and show that it is much more efficient and scalable both theoretically and empirically.","Do and Roth (2010) suggested a method for a related task of learning taxonomic relations between terms. Given a pair of terms, a small graph is constructed and constraints are imposed on the graph structure. Their work, however, is geared towards scenarios where relations are determined on-the-fly for a given pair of terms and no global knowledge base is explicitly constructed. Thus, their method easily produces solutions where global constraints, such as transitivity, are violated.","Another approximation method that violates transitivity constraints is LP relaxation (Martins et al., 2009). In LP relaxation, the constraint xij ∈ {0, 1} is replaced by 0 ≤ xij ≤ 1, transforming the problem from an ILP to a Linear Program (LP), which is polynomial. An LP solver is then applied on the problem, and variables xij that are assigned a fractional value are rounded to their nearest integer and so many violations of transitivity easily occur. The solution when applying LP relaxation is not a transitive graph, but nevertheless we show for comparison in Section 5 that our method is much faster.","Last, we note that transitive relations have been explored in adjacent fields such as Temporal Information Extraction (Ling and Weld, 2010), Ontology Induction (Poon and Domingos, 2010), and Coreference Resolution (Finkel and Manning, 2008)."]},{"title":"3 Forest-reducible Graphs","paragraphs":["The entailment relation, described by entailment graphs, is typically from a “semantically-specific” predicate to a more “general” one. Thus, intuitively, the topology of an entailment graph is expected to be “tree-like”. In this section we first formalize this intuition and then empirically analyze its validity. This property of entailment graphs is an interesting topological observation on its own, but also enables the efficient approximation algorithm of Section 4.","For a directed edge i → j in a directed acyclic graphs (DAG), we term the node i a child of node j, and j a parent of i. A directed forest is a DAG Xdisease be epidemic in Ycountry Xdisease","common in Ycountry Xdisease occur in Ycountry Xdisease","frequent in Ycountry Xdisease begin in Ycountry be epidemic in common in frequent in occur in begin in be epidemic in common in frequent in occur in begin in (a) (b) (c) Figure 1: A fragment of an entailment graph (a), its SCC graph (b) and its reduced graph (c). Nodes are predicates with typed variables (see Section 5), which are omitted in (b) and (c) for compactness. where all nodes have no more than one parent.","The entailment graph in Figure 1a (subgraph from the data set described in Section 5) is clearly not a directed forest – it contains a cycle of size two comprising the nodes ‘X common in Y’ and ‘X frequent in Y’, and in addition the node ‘X be epidemic in Y’ has 3 parents. However, we can convert it to a directed forest by applying the following operations. Any directed graph G can be converted into a Strongly-Connected-Component (SCC) graph in the following way: every strongly connected component (a set of semantically-equivalent predicates, in our graphs) is contracted into a single node, and an edge is added from SCC S1 to SCC S2 if there is an edge in G from some node in S1 to some node in S2. The SCC graph is always a DAG (Cormen et al., 2002), and if G is transitive then the SCC graph is also transitive. The graph in Figure 1b is the SCC graph of the one in 119 Xcountry annex Yplace Xcountry invade Yplace Yplace be part of Xcountry Figure 2: A fragment of an entailment graph that is not an FRG. Figure 1a, but is still not a directed forest since the node ‘X be epidemic in Y’ has two parents.","The transitive closure of a directed graph G is obtained by adding an edge from node i to node j if there is a path in G from i to j. The transitive reduction of G is obtained by removing all edges whose absence does not affect its transitive closure. In DAGs, the result of transitive reduction is unique (Aho et al., 1972). We thus define the reduced graph Gred = (Vred, Ered) of a directed graph G as the transitive reduction of its SCC graph. The graph in Figure 1c is the reduced graph of the one in Figure 1a and is a directed forest. We say a graph is a forest-reducible graph (FRG) if all nodes in its reduced form have no more than one parent.","We now hypothesize that entailment graphs are FRGs. The intuition behind this assumption is that the predicate on the left-hand-side of a unidirectional entailment rule has a more specific mean-ing than the one on the right-hand-side. For instance, in Figure 1a ‘X be epidemic in Y’ (where ‘X’ is a type of disease and ‘Y’ is a country) is more specific than ‘X common in Y’ and ‘X frequent in Y’, which are equivalent, while ‘X occur in Y’ is even more general. Accordingly, the reduced graph in Figure 1c is an FRG. We note that this is not always the case: for example, the entailment graph in Figure 2 is not an FRG, because ‘X annex Y’ entails both ‘Y be part of X’ and ‘X invade Y’, while the latter two do not entail one another. However, we hypothesize that this scenario is rather uncommon. Consequently, a natural variant of the Max-Trans-Graph problem is to restrict the required output graph of the optimization problem (1) to an FRG. We term this problem Max-Trans-Forest.","To test whether our hypothesis holds empirically we performed the following analysis. We sampled 7 gold standard entailment graphs from the data set described in Section 5, manually transformed them into FRGs by deleting a minimal number of edges, and measured recall over the set of edges in each graph (precision is naturally 1.0, as we only delete gold standard edges). The lowest recall value obtained was 0.95, illustrating that deleting a very small proportion of edges converts an entailment graph into an FRG. Further support for the practical validity of this hypothesis is obtained from our experiments in Section 5. In these experiments we show that exactly solving Max-Trans-Graph and Max-Trans-Forest (with an ILP solver) results in nearly identical performance.","An ILP formulation for Max-Trans-Forest is simple – a transitive graph is an FRG if all nodes in its reduced graph have no more than one parent. It can be verified that this is equivalent to the following statement: for every triplet of nodes i, j, k, if i → j and i → k, then either j → k or k → j (or both). Therefore, the ILP is formulated by adding this linear constraint to ILP (1): ∀i,j,k∈V xij +xik +(1 − xjk)+(1 − xkj) ≤ 3 (2) We note that despite the restriction to FRGs, Max-Trans-Forest is an NP-hard problem by a reduction from the X3C problem (Garey and Johnson, 1979). We omit the reduction details for brevity."]},{"title":"4 Sequential Approximation Algorithms","paragraphs":["In this section we present Tree-Node-Fix, an efficient approximation algorithm for Max-Trans-Forest, as well as Graph-Node-Fix, an approximation for Max-Trans-Graph. 4.1 Tree-Node-Fix The scheme of Tree-Node-Fix (TNF) is the following. First, an initial FRG is constructed, using some initialization procedure. Then, at each iteration a single node v is re-attached (see below) to the FRG in a way that improves the objective function. This is repeated until the value of the objective function cannot be improved anymore by re-attaching a node.","Re-attaching a node v is performed by removing v from the graph and connecting it back with a better set of edges, while maintaining the constraint that it is an FRG.

We approximate a solution for (1) by iteratively optimizing the simpler objective (3). Clearly, at each re-attachment the value of the objective function cannot decrease, since the optimization algorithm considers the previous graph as one of its candidate solutions.","We now show that re-attaching a node v is linear. To analyze v’s re-attachment, we consider the structure of the directed forest Gred just before v is re-inserted, and examine the possibilities for v’s in-sertion relative to that structure. We start by defin-ing some helpful notations. Every node c ∈ Vred is a connected component in G. Let vc ∈ c be an arbitrary representative node in c. We denote by Sv-in(c) the sum of weights from all nodes in c and their descendants to v, and by Sv-out(c) the sum of weights from v to all nodes in c and their ancestors: Sv-in(c) = ∑ i∈c wiv + ∑ k /∈c wkvxkvc Sv-out(c) = ∑ i∈c wvi + ∑ k /∈c wvkxvck","Note that {xvck, xkvc} are edge indicators in G and not Gred. There are two possibilities for re-attaching v – either it is inserted into an existing component c ∈ Vred (Figure 3a), or it forms a new component. In the latter, there are also two cases: either v is inserted as a child of a component c (Figure 3b), or not and then it becomes a root in Gred (Figure 3c). We describe the details of these 3 cases:","Case 1: Inserting v into a component c ∈ Vred. In this case we add in G edges from all nodes in c and their descendants to v and from v to all nodes in c and their ancestors. The score (3) in this case is s1(c) ≜ Sv-in(c) + Sv-out(c) (4)","Case 2: Inserting v as a child of some c ∈ Vred. Once c is chosen as the parent of v, choosing v’s children in Gred is substantially constrained. A node that is not a descendant of c can not become a child of v, since this would create a new path from that node to c and would require by transitivity to add a corresponding directed edge to c (but all graph edges not connecting v are fixed). Moreover, only a direct child of c can choose v as a parent instead of c (Figure 3b), since for any other descendant of c, v would become a second parent, and Gred will no longer be a directed forest (Figure 3b’). Thus, this case requires adding in G edges from v to all nodes in c and their ancestors, and also for each new child of v, denoted by d ∈ Vred, we add edges from all nodes in d and their descendants to v. Crucially, although the number of possible subsets of c’s children in Gred is exponential, the fact that they are independent trees in Gred allows us to go over them one by one, and decide for each one whether it will be a child of v or not, depending on whether Sv-in(d) is positive. Therefore, the score (3) in this case is: s2(c) ≜ Sv-out(c)+∑ d∈child(c)max(0, Sv-in(d)) (5) where child(c) are the children of c.","Case 3: Inserting v as a new root in Gred. Similar to case 2, only roots of Gred can become children of v. In this case for each chosen root r we add in G edges from the nodes in r and their descendants to v. Again, each root can be examined independently. Therefore, the score (3) of re-attaching v is: s3 ≜ ∑ r max(0, Sv-in(r)) (6) where the summation is over the roots of Gred.","It can be easily verified that Sv-in(c) and Sv-out(c) satisfy the recursive definitions: 121 Algorithm 1 Computing optimal re-attachment Input: FRG G = (V, E), function w, node v ∈ V Output: optimal re-attachment of v 1: remove v and compute Gred = (Vred, Ered). 2: for all c ∈ Vred in post-order compute Sv-in(c) (Eq.","7) 3: for all c ∈ Vred in pre-order compute Sv-out(c) (Eq.","8) 4: case 1: s1 = maxc∈Vred s1(c) (Eq. 4) 5: case 2: s2 = maxc∈Vred s2(c) (Eq. 5) 6: case 3: compute s3 (Eq. 6) 7: re-attach v according to max(s1, s2, s3).

These recursive definitions allow to compute in linear time Sv-in(c) and Sv-out(c) for all c (given Gred) using dynamic programming, before going over the cases for re-attaching v. Sv-in(c) is computed going over Vred leaves-to-root (post-order), and Sv-out(c) is computed going over Vred root-to-leaves (pre-order).","Re-attachment is summarized in Algorithm 1. Computing an SCC graph is linear (Cormen et al., 2002) and it is easy to verify that transitive reduction in FRGs is also linear (Line 1). Computing Sv-in(c) and Sv-out(c) (Lines 2-3) is also linear, as explained. Cases 1 and 3 are trivially linear and in case 2 we go over the children of all nodes in Vred. As the reduced graph is a forest, this simply means going over all nodes of Vred, and so the entire algorithm is linear.","Since re-attachment is linear, re-attaching all nodes is quadratic. Thus if we bound the number of iterations over all nodes, the overall complexity is quadratic. This is dramatically more efficient and scalable than applying an ILP solver. In Section 5 we ran TNF until convergence and the maximal number of iterations over graph nodes was 8. 4.2 Graph-node-fix Next, we show Graph-Node-Fix (GNF), a similar approximation that employs the same re-attachment strategy but does not assume the graph is an FRG. Thus, re-attachment of a node v is done with an ILP solver. Nevertheless, the ILP in GNF is simpler than (1), since we consider only candidate edges v i k v i k v i k v i k Figure 4: Three types of transitivity constraint violations. involving v. Figure 4 illustrates the three types of possible transitivity constraint violations when re-attaching v. The left side depicts a violation when (i, k) /∈ E, expressed by the constraint in (9) below, and the middle and right depict two violations when the edge (i, k) ∈ E, expressed by the constraints in (10). Thus, the ILP is formulated by adding the following constraints to the objective function (3): ∀i,k∈V \\{v} if (i, k) /∈ E, xiv + xvk ≤ 1 (9) if (i, k) ∈ E, xvi ≤ xvk, xkv ≤ xiv (10) xiv, xvk ∈ {0, 1} (11) Complexity is exponential due to the ILP solver; however, the ILP size is reduced by an order of magnitude to O(|V |) variables and O(|V |2",") constraints. 4.3 Adding local constraints For some pairs of predicates i, j we sometimes have prior knowledge whether i entails j or not. We term such pairs local constraints, and incorporate them into the aforementioned algorithms in the following way. In all algorithms that apply an ILP solver, we add a constraint xij = 1 if i entails j or xij = 0 if i does not entail j. Similarly, in TNF we incorporate local constraints by setting wij = ∞ or wij = −∞."]},{"title":"5 Experiments and Results","paragraphs":["In this section we empirically demonstrate that TNF is more efficient than other baselines and its output quality is close to that given by the optimal solution. 5.1 Experimental setting In our experiments we utilize the data set released by Berant et al. (2011). The data set contains 10 entailment graphs, where graph nodes are typed predicates. A typed predicate (e.g., ‘Xdisease occur in Ycountry’) includes a predicate and two typed variables that specify the semantic type of the arguments. For instance, the typed variable Xdisease can be instantiated by arguments such as ‘flu’ or ‘diabetes’. The data set contains 39,012 potential edges, 122 of which 3,427 are annotated as edges (valid entailment rules) and 35,585 are annotated as non-edges.","The data set also contains, for every pair of predicates i, j in every graph, a local score sij, which is the output of a classifier trained over distributional similarity features. A positive sij indicates that the classifier believes i → j. The weighting function for the graph edges w is defined as wij = sij − λ, where λ is a single parameter controlling graph sparseness: as λ increases, wij decreases and becomes nega-tive for more pairs of predicates, rendering the graph more sparse.

In future work, we aim to evaluate TNF on large graphs that are automatically generated from huge corpora. This of course requires substantial efforts of pre-processing and test-set annotation. We also plan to examine the benefit of TNF in learning similar structures, e.g., taxonomies or ontologies."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was partially supported by the Israel Science Foundation grant 1112/08, the PASCAL-2 Network of Excellence of the European Community FP7-ICT-2007-1-216886, and the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 287923 (EXCITEMENT).
