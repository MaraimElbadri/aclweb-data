Specifically, we exploit short-distance cues to hypernymy, semantic compatibility, and semantic context, as well as general lexical co-occurrence. When added to a state-of-the-art coreference baseline, our Web features give significant gains on multiple datasets (ACE 2004 and ACE 2005) and metrics (MUC and B3","), resulting in the best results reported to date for the end-to-end task of coreference resolution."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Many of the most difficult ambiguities in coreference resolution are semantic in nature. For instance, consider the following example: When Obama met Jobs, the president discussed the economy, technology, and educa-tion. His election campaign is expected to [...] For resolving coreference in this example, a system would benefit from the world knowledge that Obama is the president. Also, to resolve the pronoun his to the correct antecedent Obama, we can use the knowledge that Obama has an election campaign while Jobs does not. Such ambiguities are difficult to resolve on purely syntactic or configurational grounds.","There have been multiple previous systems that incorporate some form of world knowledge in coreference resolution tasks. Most work (Poesio et al., 2004; Markert and Nissim, 2005; Yang et al., 2005; Bergsma and Lin, 2006) addresses special cases and subtasks such as bridging anaphora, other anaphora, definite NP reference, and pronoun resolution, computing semantic compatibility via Web-hits and counts from large corpora. There is also work on end-to-end coreference resolution that uses large noun-similarity lists (Daumé III and Marcu, 2005) or structured knowledge bases such as Wikipedia (Yang and Su, 2007; Haghighi and Klein, 2009; Kobdani et al., 2011) and YAGO (Rahman and Ng, 2011). However, such structured knowledge bases are of limited scope, and, while Haghighi and Klein (2010) self-acquires knowledge about coreference, it does so only via reference constructions and on a limited scale.","In this paper, we look to the Web for broader if shallower sources of semantics. In order to harness the information on the Web without presupposing a deep understanding of all Web text, we instead turn to a diverse collection of Web n-gram counts (Brants and Franz, 2006) which, in aggregate, contain diffuse and indirect, but often robust, cues to reference. For example, we can collect the co-occurrence statistics of an anaphor with various candidate antecedents to judge relative surface affinities (i.e., (Obama, president) versus (Jobs, president)). We can also count co-occurrence statistics of competing antecedents when placed in the context of an anaphoric pronoun (i.e., Obama’s election campaign versus Jobs’ election campaign).","All of our features begin with a pair of headwords from candidate mention pairs and compute statistics derived from various potentially informative queries’ counts. We explore five major categories of semantically informative Web features, based on (1) general lexical affinities (via generic co-occurrence statistics), (2) lexical relations (via Hearst-style hypernymy patterns), (3) similarity of entity-based context (e.g., common values of y for 389 which h is a y is attested), (4) matches of distributional soft cluster ids, and (5) attested substitutions of candidate antecedents in the context of a pronominal anaphor.","We first describe a strong baseline consisting of the mention-pair model of the Reconcile system (Stoyanov et al., 2009; Stoyanov et al., 2010) using a decision tree (DT) as its pairwise classifier. To this baseline system, we add our suite of features in turn, each class of features providing substantial gains. Altogether, our final system produces the best numbers reported to date on end-to-end coreference resolution (with automatically detected system mentions) on multiple data sets (ACE 2004 and ACE 2005) and metrics (MUC and B3","), achieving significant improvements over the Reconcile DT baseline and over the state-of-the-art results of Haghighi and Klein (2010)."]},{"title":"2 Baseline System","paragraphs":["Before describing our semantic Web features, we first describe our baseline. The core inference and features come from the Reconcile package (Stoyanov et al., 2009; Stoyanov et al., 2010), with modifications described below. Our baseline differs most substantially from Stoyanov et al. (2009) in using a decision tree classifier rather than an averaged linear perceptron. 2.1 Reconcile Reconcile is one of the best implementations of the mention-pair model (Soon et al., 2001) of coreference resolution. The mention-pair model relies on a pairwise function to determine whether or not two mentions are coreferent. Pairwise predictions are then consolidated by transitive closure (or some other clustering method) to form the final set of coreference clusters (chains). While our Web features could be adapted to entity-mention systems, their current form was most directly applicable to the mention-pair approach, making Reconcile a particularly well-suited platform for this investigation.","The Reconcile system provides baseline features, learning mechanisms, and resolution procedures that already achieve near state-of-the-art results on multiple popular datasets using multiple standard metrics. It includes over 80 core features that exploit various automatically generated annotations such as named entity tags, syntactic parses, and WordNet classes, inspired by Soon et al. (2001), Ng and Cardie (2002), and Bengtson and Roth (2008). The Reconcile system also facilitates standardized empirical evaluation to past work.1","In this paper, we develop a suite of simple semantic Web features based on pairs of mention headwords which stack with the default Reconcile features to surpass past state-of-the-art results. 2.2 Decision Tree Classifier Among the various learning algorithms that Reconcile supports, we chose the decision tree classifier, available in Weka (Hall et al., 2009) as J48, an open source Java implementation of the C4.5 algorithm of Quinlan (1993).","The C4.5 algorithm builds decision trees by incrementally maximizing information gain. The training data is a set of already classified samples, where each sample is a vector of attributes or features. At each node of the tree, C4.5 splits the data on an attribute that most effectively splits its set of samples into more ordered subsets, and then recurses on these smaller subsets. The decision tree can then be used to classify a new sample by following a path from the root downward based on the attribute values of the sample.","We find the decision tree classifier to work better than the default averaged perceptron (used by Stoyanov et al. (2009)), on multiple datasets using multiple metrics (see Section 4.3). Many advantages have been claimed for decision tree classifiers, including interpretability and robustness. However, we suspect that the aspect most relevant to our case is that decision trees can capture non-linear interactions between features. For example, recency is very important for pronoun reference but much less so for nominal reference."]},{"title":"3 Semantics via Web Features","paragraphs":["Our Web features for coreference resolution are simple and capture a range of diffuse world knowledge. Given a mention pair, we use the head finder in Reconcile to find the lexical heads of both mentions (for 1 We use the default configuration settings of Reconcile","(Stoyanov et al., 2010) unless mentioned otherwise. 390 example, the head of the Palestinian territories is the word territories). Next, we take each headword pair (h1, h2) and compute various Web-count functions on it that can signal whether or not this mention pair is coreferent.","As the source of Web information, we use the Google n-grams corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006) which contains English n-grams (n = 1 to 5) and their Web frequency counts, derived from nearly 1 trillion word tokens and 95 billion sentences. Because we have many queries that must be run against this corpus, we apply the trie-based hashing algorithm of Bansal and Klein (2011) to efficiently an-swer all of them in one pass over it. The features that require word clusters (Section 3.4) use the output of Lin et al. (2010).2","We describe our five types of features in turn. The first four types are most intuitive for mention pairs where both members are non-pronominal, but, aside from the general co-occurrence group, helped for all mention pair types. The fifth feature group applies only to pairs in which the anaphor is a pronoun but the antecedent is a non-pronoun. Related work for each feature category is discussed inline. 3.1 General co-occurrence These features capture co-occurrence statistics of the two headwords, i.e., how often h1 and h2 are seen adjacent or nearly adjacent on the Web. This count can be a useful coreference signal because, in general, mentions referring to the same entity will co-occur more frequently (in large corpora) than those that do not. Using the n-grams corpus (for n = 1 to 5), we collect co-occurrence Web-counts by allowing a varying number of wildcards between h1 and h2 in the query. The co-occurrence value is: bin ( log10 ( c12 c1 · c2 ))","2","These clusters are derived form the V2 Google n-grams corpus. The V2 corpus itself is not publicly available, but the clusters are available at http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/ s̃bergsma/PhrasalClusters where c12 = count(“h1 ⋆ h2”) + count(“h1 ⋆ ⋆ h2”) + count(“h1 ⋆ ⋆ ⋆ h2”), c1 = count(“h1”), and c2 = count(“h2”). We normalize the overall co-occurrence count of the headword pair c12 by the unigram counts of the individual headwords c1 and c2, so that high-frequency headwords do not unfairly get a high feature value (this is similar to computing scaled mutual information MI (Church and Hanks, 1989)).3","This normalized value is quantized by taking its log10 and binning. The actual feature that fires is an indicator of which quantized bin the query produced. As a real example from our development set, the co-occurrence count c12 for the headword pair (leader, president) is 11383, while it is only 95 for the headword pair (voter, president); after normalization and log10, the values are -10.9 and -12.0, respectively.","These kinds of general Web co-occurrence statistics have been used previously for other supervised NLP tasks such as spelling correction and syntactic parsing (Bergsma et al., 2010; Bansal and Klein, 2011). In coreference, similar word-association scores were used by Kobdani et al. (2011), but from Wikipedia and for self-training. 3.2 Hearst co-occurrence These features capture templated co-occurrence of the two headwords h1 and h2 in the Web-corpus. Here, we only collect statistics of the headwords co-occurring with a generalized Hearst pattern (Hearst, 1992) in between. Hearst patterns capture various lexical semantic relations between items. For example, seeing X is a Y or X and other Y indicates hypernymy and also tends to cue coreference. The specific patterns we use are: • h1 {is | are | was | were} {a | an | the}? h2 • h1 {and | or} {other | the other | another} h2 • h1 other than {a | an | the}? h2 3 We also tried adding count(“h1 h2”) to c12 but this","decreases performance, perhaps because truly adjacent occur-","rences are often not grammatical. 391 • h1 such as {a | an | the}? h2 • h1 , including {a | an | the}? h2 • h1 , especially {a | an | the}? h2 • h1 of {the| all}? h2","For this feature, we again use a quantized normalized count as in Section 3.1, but c12 here is restricted to n-grams where one of the above patterns occurs in between the headwords. We did not allow wildcards in between the headwords and the Hearst-patterns because this introduced a significant amount of noise. Also, we do not constrain the order of h1 and h2 because these patterns can hold for either direction of coreference.4","As a real example from our development set, the c12 count for the headword pair (leader, president) is 752, while for (voter, president), it is 0.","Hypernymic semantic compatibility for coreference is intuitive and has been explored in varying forms by previous work. Poesio et al. (2004) and Markert and Nissim (2005) employ a subset of our Hearst patterns and Web-hits for the subtasks of bridging anaphora, other-anaphora, and definite NP resolution. Others (Haghighi and Klein, 2009; Rahman and Ng, 2011; Daumé III and Marcu, 2005) use similar relations to extract compatibility statistics from Wikipedia, YAGO, and noun-similarity lists. Yang and Su (2007) use Wikipedia to automatically extract semantic patterns, which are then used as features in a learning setup. Instead of extracting patterns from the training data, we use all the above patterns, which helps us generalize to new datasets for end-to-end coreference resolution (see Section 4.3). 3.3 Entity-based context For each headword h, we first collect contextseeds y using the pattern h {is | are | was | were} {a | an | the}? y taking seeds y in order of decreasing Web count. The corresponding ordered seed list Y = {y} gives us useful information about the headword’s entity type. For example, for h = president, the top 4 Two minor variants not listed above are h1 including h2","and h1 especially h2. 30 seeds (and their parts of speech) include important cues such as president is elected (verb), president is authorized (verb), president is responsible (adjective), president is the chief (adjective), president is above (preposition), and president is the head (noun).","Matches in the seed lists of two headwords can be a strong signal that they are coreferent. For example, in the top 30 seed lists for the headword pair (leader, president), we get matches including elected, responsible, and expected. To capture this effect, we create a feature that indicates whether there is a match in the top k seeds of the two headwords (where k is a hyperparameter to tune).","We create another feature that indicates whether the dominant parts of speech in the seed lists matches for the headword pair. We first collect the POS tags (using length 2 character prefixes to indicate coarse parts of speech) of the seeds matched in the top k′","seed lists of the two headwords, where k′","is another hyperparameter to tune. If the dominant tags match and are in a small list of important tags ({JJ, NN, RB, VB}), we fire an indicator feature specifying the matched tag, otherwise we fire ano-match indicator. To obtain POS tags for the seeds, we use a unigram-based POS tagger trained on the WSJ treebank training set. 3.4 Cluster information The distributional hypothesis of Harris (1954) says that words that occur in similar contexts tend to have a similar linguistic behavior. Here, we design features with the idea that this hypothesis extends to reference: mentions occurring in similar contexts in large document sets such as the Web tend to be compatible for coreference. Instead of collecting the contexts of each mention and creating sparse features from them, we use Web-scale distributional clustering to summarize compatibility.","Specifically, we begin with the phrase-based clusters from Lin et al. (2010), which were created using the Google n-grams V2 corpus. These clusters come from distributional K-Means clustering (with K = 1000) on phrases, using the n-gram context as features. The cluster data contains almost 10 million phrases and their soft cluster memberships. Up to twenty cluster ids with the highest centroid similarities are included for each phrase in this dataset 392 (Lin et al., 2010).","Our cluster-based features assume that if the headwords of the two mentions have matches in their cluster id lists, then they are more compatible for coreference. We check the match of not just the top 1 cluster ids, but also farther down in the 20 sized lists because, as discussed in Lin and Wu (2009), the soft cluster assignments often reveal different senses of a word. However, we also assume that higher-ranked matches tend to imply closer meanings. To this end, we fire a feature indicating the value bin(i+j), where i and j are the earliest match positions in the cluster id lists of h1 and h2. Binning here means that match positions in a close range generally trigger the same feature.","Recent previous work has used clustering information to improve the performance of supervised NLP tasks such as NER and dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008; Lin and Wu, 2009). However, in coreference, the only related work to our knowledge is from Daumé III and Marcu (2005), who use word class features derived from a Web-scale corpus via a process described in Ravichandran et al. (2005). 3.5 Pronoun context Our last feature category specifically addresses pronoun reference, for cases when the anaphoric mention N P2 (and hence its headword h2) is a pronoun, while the candidate antecedent mention N P1 (and hence its headword h1) is not. For such a headword pair (h1, h2), the idea is to substitute the non-pronoun h1 into h2’s position and see whether the result is attested on the Web.","If the anaphoric pronominal mention is h2 and its sentential context is l’ l h2 r r’, then the substituted phrase will be l’ l h1 r r’.5","High Web counts of substituted phrases tend to indicate semantic compatibility. Perhaps unsurprisingly for English, only the right context was useful in this capacity. We chose the following three context types, based on performance on a development set:","5","Possessive pronouns are replaced with an additional apostrophe, i.e., h1 ’s. We also use features (see R1Gap) that allow wildcards (⋆) in between the headword and the context when collecting Web-counts, in order to allow for determiners and other filler words. • h1 r (R1) • h1 r r’ (R2) • h1 ⋆ r (R1Gap)","As an example of the R1Gap feature, if the anaphor h2 + context is his victory and one candidate antecedent h1 is Bush, then we compute the normalized value","count(“Bush ′","s ⋆ victory”)","count(“ ⋆ ′","s ⋆ victory”)count(“Bush”) In general, we compute","count(“h1 ′","s ⋆ r”)","count(“ ⋆ ′","s ⋆ r”)count(“h1”)","The final feature value is again a normalized count converted to log10 and then binned.6","We have three separate features for the R1, R2, and R1Gap context types. We tune a separate bin-size hyperparameter for each of these three features.","These pronoun resolution features are similar to selectional preference work by Yang et al. (2005) and Bergsma and Lin (2006), who compute semantic compatibility for pronouns in specific syntactic relationships such as possessive-noun, subject-verb, etc. In our case, we directly use the general context of any pronominal anaphor to find its most compatible antecedent.","Note that all our above features are designed to be non-sparse by firing indicators of the quantized Web statistics and not the lexical- or class-based identities of the mention pair. This keeps the total number of features small, which is important for the relatively small datasets used for coreference resolution. We go from around 100 features in the Reconcile baseline to around 165 features after adding all our Web features.","6","Normalization helps us with two kinds of balancing. First, we divide by the count of the antecedent so that when choos-ing the best antecedent for a fixed anaphor, we are not biased towards more frequently occurring antecedents. Second, we divide by the count of the context so that across anaphora, an anaphor with rarer context does not get smaller values (for all its candidate antecedents) than another anaphor with a more common context. 393 Dataset docs dev test ment chn ACE04 128 63/27 90/38 3037 1332 ACE05 81 40/17 57/24 1991 775","ACE05-ALL 599 337/145 482/117 9217 3050 Table 1: Dataset characteristics – docs: the total number of documents; dev: the train/test split during development; test: the train/test split during testing; ment: the number of gold mentions in the test split; chn: the number of coreference chains in the test split."]},{"title":"4 Experiments 4.1 Data","paragraphs":["We show results on three popular and comparatively larger coreference resolution data sets – the ACE04, ACE05, and ACE05-ALL datasets from the ACE Program (NIST, 2004).

Moreover, the improvements from our Web features are similar even when tried over the SIG baseline; hence, the filter choice doesn’t affect the performance gain from the Web features.","Barry Bonds ; the best baseball player Vojislav Kostunica ; the pro-democracy leader its closest rival ; the German magazine Das Motorrad","One of those difficult-to-dislodge judges ; John Marshall","These pairs are cases where our features on Hearst-style co-occurrence and entity-based context-match are informative and help discriminate in favor of the correct antecedents. One advantage of using Web-based features is that the Web has a surprising amount of information on even rare entities such as proper names. Our features also correct coreference for various cases of pronominal anaphora, but these corrections are harder to convey out of context.","Next, we analyze the decision tree built after training the classifier (with all our Web features included). Around 30% of the decision nodes (both non-terminals and leaves) correspond to Web features, and the average error in classification at the Web-feature leaves is only around 2.5%, suggest-ing that our features are strongly discriminative for pairwise coreference decisions. Some of the most discriminative nodes correspond to the general co-occurrence feature for most (binned) log-count values, the Hearst-style co-occurrence feature for its zero-count value, the cluster-match feature for its zero-match value, and the R2 pronoun context feature for certain (binned) log-count values."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have presented a collection of simple Web-count features for coreference resolution that capture a range of world knowledge via statistics of general lexical co-occurrence, hypernymy, semantic compatibility, and semantic context. When added to a strong decision tree baseline, these features give significant improvements and achieve the best results reported to date, across multiple datasets and metrics."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Nathan Gilbert, Adam Pauls, and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful suggestions.
