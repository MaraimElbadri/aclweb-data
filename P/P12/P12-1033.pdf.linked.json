Although state-of-the-art translation models use rules that operate on units bigger than words (like phrases or tree fragments), they nearly always use word alignments to drive extraction of those translation rules. The dominant approach to word alignment has been the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993) together with the HMM model (Vogel et al., 1996). These models are unsupervised, making them applicable to any language pair for which parallel text is available. Moreover, they are widely disseminated in the open-source GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2004). These properties make them the default choice for most statistical MT systems.","In the decades since their invention, many models have surpassed them in accuracy, but none has supplanted them in practice. Some of these models are partially supervised, combining unlabeled parallel text with manually-aligned parallel text (Moore, 2005; Taskar et al., 2005; Riesa and Marcu, 2010). Although manually-aligned data is very valuable, it is only available for a small number of language pairs. Other models are unsupervised like the IBM models (Liang et al., 2006; Graca̧ et al., 2010; Dyer et al., 2011), but have not been as widely adopted as GIZA++ has.","In this paper, we propose a simple extension to the IBM/HMM models that is unsupervised like the IBM models, is as scalable as GIZA++ because it is implemented on top of GIZA++, and provides significant improvements in both alignment and translation quality. It extends the IBM/HMM models by incorporating an l0 prior, inspired by the principle of minimum description length (Barron et al., 1998), to encourage sparsity in the word-to-word translation model (Section 2.2). This extension follows our previous work on unsupervised part-of-speech tagging (Vaswani et al., 2010), but enables it to scale to the large datasets typical in word alignment, using an efficient training method based on projected gradient descent (Section 2.3). Experiments on Czech-, Arabic-, Chinese- and Urdu-English translation (Section 3) demonstrate consistent significant improvements over IBM Model 4 in both word alignment (up to +6.7 F1) and translation quality (up to +1.4 Bleu). Our implementation has been released as a simple modification to the GIZA++ toolkit that can be used as a drop-in replacement for GIZA++ in any existing MT pipeline. 311"]},{"title":"2 Method","paragraphs":["We start with a brief review of the IBM and HMM word alignment models, then describe how to extend them with a smoothed l0 prior and how to efficiently train them. 2.1 IBM Models and HMM Given a French string f = f1 · · · f j · · · fm and an English string e = e1 · · · ei · · · el, these models describe the process by which the French string is generated by the English string via the alignment a = a1, . . . , a j, . . . , am. Each a j is a hidden variables, indicating which English word eaj the French word f j is aligned to.","In IBM Model 1–2 and the HMM model, the joint probability of the French sentence and alignment given the English sentence is P(f, a | e) = m∏ j=1 d(a j | a j−1, j)t( f j | eaj). (1) The parameters of these models are the distortion probabilities d(a j | a j−1, j) and the translation probabilities t( f j | eaj). The three models differ in their estimation of d, but the differences do not concern us here. All three models, as well as IBM Models 3–5, share the same t. For further details of these models, the reader is referred to the original papers describ-ing them (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996).","Let θ stand for all the parameters of the model. The standard training procedure is to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood, or, equivalently, minimize the negative log-likelihood of the observed data:","θ̂ = arg min θ ( − log P(f | e, θ) ) (2)","= arg min θ  − log ∑ a P(f, a | e, θ)   (3) This is done using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977). 2.2 MAP-EM with the l0-norm Maximum likelihood training is prone to overfitting, especially in models with many parameters. In word alignment, one well-known manifestation of overfitting is that rare words can act as “garbage collectors” (Moore, 2004), aligning to many unrelated words. This hurts alignment precision and rule-extraction recall. Previous attempted remedies include early stopping, smoothing (Moore, 2004), and posterior regularization (Graca̧ et al., 2010).","We have previously proposed another simple remedy to overfitting in the context of unsupervised part-of-speech tagging (Vaswani et al., 2010), which is to minimize the size of the model using a smoothed l0 prior. Applying this prior to an HMM improves tagging accuracy for both Italian and English.","Here, our goal is to apply a similar prior in a word-alignment model to the word-to-word translation probabilities t( f | e). We leave the distortion models alone, since they are not very large, and there is not much reason to believe that we can profit from compacting them.","With the addition of the l0 prior, the MAP (maximum a posteriori) objective function is","θ̂ = arg min θ ( − log P(f | e, θ)P(θ) ) (4) where P(θ) ∝ exp ( −α∥θ∥ β 0 ) (5) and ∥θ∥ β 0 = ∑ e, f ( 1 − exp","−t( f | e) β ) (6) is a smoothed approximation of the l0-norm. The hyperparameter β controls the tightness of the approximation, as illustrated in Figure 1. Substituting back into (4) and dropping constant terms, we get the following optimization problem: minimize − log P(f | e, θ) − α ∑ e, f exp","−t( f | e) β (7)","subject to the constraints ∑ f t( f | e) = 1 for all e. (8)","We can carry out the optimization in (7) with the MAP-EM algorithm (Bishop, 2006).

The count C(e, f ) is the number of times that f occurs aligned to e. For MAP-EM, it is:","θ̂ = arg min θ ( − ∑ e, f E[C(e, f )] log t( f | e) − α ∑ e, f exp","−t( f | e) β ) (10)","This optimization problem is non-convex, and we do not know of a closed-form solution. Previously (Vaswani et al., 2010), we used ALGENCAN, a nonlinear optimization toolkit, but this solution does not scale well to the number of parameters involved in word alignment models. Instead, we use a simpler and more scalable method which we describe in the next section. 2.3 Projected gradient descent Following Schoenemann (2011b), we use projected gradient descent (PGD) to solve the M-step (but with the l0-norm instead of the l1-norm). Gradient projection methods are attractive solutions to constrained optimization problems, particularly when the constraints on the parameters are simple (Bertsekas, 1999). Let F(θ) be the objective function in (10); we seek to minimize this function. As in previous work (Vaswani et al., 2010), we optimize each set of parameters {t(· | e)} separately for each English word type e. The inputs to the PGD are the expected counts E[C(e, f )] and the current word-to-word conditional probabilities θ. We run PGD for K iterations, producing a sequence of intermediate parameter vectors θ1",", . . . , θk",", . . . , θK",". Each iteration has two steps, a projection step and a line search. Projection step In this step, we compute: θ k =","[ θk − s∇F(θk",")]∆ (11) This moves θ in the direction of steepest descent (∇F) with step size s, and then the function [·]∆ projects the resulting point onto the simplex; that is, it finds the nearest point that satisfies the constraints (8).","The gradient ∇F(θk",") is","∂F ∂t( f | e) = − E[C( f, e)] t( f | e) + α β exp","−t( f | e) β (12)","In contrast to Schoenemann (2011b), we use an O(n log n) algorithm for the projection step due to Duchi et. al.

We keep s fixed for all PGD iterations; we experimented with s ∈ {0.1, 0.5} and did not observe significant changes in F-score. We run the projection step and line search alternately for at most K iterations, terminating early if there is no change in θk from one iteration to the next. We set K = 35 for the large Arabic-English experiment; for all other conditions, we set K = 50. These choices were made to balance efficiency and accuracy. We found that values of K between 30 and 75 were generally reasonable."]},{"title":"3 Experiments","paragraphs":["To demonstrate the effect of the l0-norm on the IBM models, we performed experiments on four translation tasks: Arabic-English, Chinese-English, and Urdu-English from the NIST Open MT Evaluation, and the Czech-English translation from the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT) shared task. We measured the accuracy of word alignments generated by GIZA++ with and without the l0-norm, and also translation accuracy of systems trained using the word alignments. Across all tests, we found strong improvements from adding the l0-norm. 3.1 Training We have implemented our algorithm as an open-source extension to GIZA++.1","Usage of the extension is identical to standard GIZA++, except that the user can switch the l0 prior on or off, and adjust the hyperparameters α and β.","For vanilla EM, we ran five iterations of Model 1, five iterations of HMM, and ten iterations of Model 4.

For Arabic-English and Chinese-English, we used 346 and 184 hand-aligned sentences from LDC2006E86 and LDC2006E93. Similarly, for Czech-English, 515 hand-aligned sentences were available (Bojar and Prokopová, 2006). But for Urdu-English, since we did not have any gold alignments, we used α = 10 and β = 0.05. We did not choose a large α, as the dataset was small, and we chose a conservative value for β.","We ran word alignment in both directions and symmetrized using grow-diag-final (Koehn et al., 2003). For models with the smoothed l0 prior, we tuned α and β separately in each direction. 3.2 Alignment First, we evaluated alignment accuracy directly by comparing against gold-standard word alignments. 4 This data is available at http://statmt.org/wmt10. The results are shown in the alignment F1 column of Table 1. We used balanced F-measure rather than alignment error rate as our metric (Fraser and Marcu, 2007).","Following Dyer et al. (2011), we also measured the average fertility, φ̃sing., of once-seen source words in the symmetrized alignments.

However, this is prohibitively expensive, especially if we must tune them separately in each alignment direction before symmetrization. We ran some contrastive experiments to investigate the impact of hyperparameter tuning on translation quality. For the smaller Arabic-English corpus, we symmetrized all combinations of the two top-scoring alignments (according to F1) in each direction, yielding four sets of alignments. Table 4 shows Bleu scores for translation models learned from these alignments. Unfortunately, we find that optimizing F1 is not optimal for Bleu—using the second-best alignments yields a further improve-ment of 0.5 Bleu on the NIST 2009 data, which is statistically significant (p < 0.05)."]},{"title":"4 Related Work","paragraphs":["Schoenemann (2011a), taking inspiration from Bodrumlu et al.
