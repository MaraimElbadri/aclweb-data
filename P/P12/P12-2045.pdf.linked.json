Events are complex linguistically and ontologically, so disambiguating their reference is challenging. We introduce event linking, which canonically labels an event reference with the article where it was first reported. This implicitly relaxes coreference to co-reporting, and will practically enable augmenting news archives with semantic hyperlinks. We annotate and analyse a corpus of 150 documents, extracting 501 links to a news archive with reasonable inter-annotator agreement."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Interpreting news requires identifying its constituent events. Information extraction (IE) makes this feasible by considering only events of a specified type, such as personnel succession or arrest (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996; LDC, 2005), an approach not extensible to novel events, or the same event types in sub-domains, e.g. sport. On the other hand, topic detection and tracking (TDT; Allan, 2002) disregards individual event mentions, clustering together articles that share a topic.","Between these fine and coarse-grained approaches, event identification requires grouping references to the same event. However, strict coreference is hampered by the complexity of event semantics: poison, murder and die may indicate the same effective event. The solution is to tag mentions with a canonical identifier for each news-triggering event.","This paper introduces event linking: given a past event reference in context, find the article in a news archive that first reports that the event happened. The task has an immediate practical application: some online newspapers link past event mentions to relevant news stories, but currently do so with low coverage and consistency; an event linker can add referentially-precise hyperlinks to news.","The event linking task parallels entity linking (NEL; Ji and Grishman, 2011), considering a news archive as a knowledge base (KB) of events, where each article exclusively represents the zero or more events that it first reports. Coupled with an appropriate event extractor, event linking may be per-formed for all events mentioned in a document, like the named entity disambiguation task (Bunescu and Paşca, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007).","We have annotated and analysed 150 news and opinion articles, marking references to past, newsworthy events, and linking where possible to canonical articles in a 13-year news archive."]},{"title":"2 The events in a news story","paragraphs":["Approaches to news event processing are subsumed within broader notions of topics, scenario templates, or temporal entities, among others. We illustrate key challenges in processing news events and motivate event linking through the example story in Figure 1. Salience Our story highlights carjackings and a police warning as newsworthy, alongside events like feeding, drove and told which carry less individual weight. Orthogonally, parts of the story are new events, while others are previously reported events that the reader may be aware of (illustrated in Figure 1). Online, the two background carjackings and the police warning are hyperlinked to other SMH articles where they were reported. Event schemas tend not to directly address salience: MUC-style IE (Gr-228","N Sydney man carjacked at knifepoint There has been another carjacking in Sydney,","B two weeks after two people were stabbed in their cars in separate incidents.","N A 32-year-old driver was walking to his station wagon on Hickson Road, Millers Point, after feeding his parking meter about 4.30pm yesterday when a man armed with a knife grabbed him and told him to hand over his car keys and mobile phone, police said. The carjacker then drove the black 2008 Holden Commodore. . . He was described as a 175-centimetre-tall Caucasian. . .","B Police warned Sydney drivers to keep their car doors locked after two stabbings this month. On September 4, a 40-year-old man was stabbed when three men tried to steal his car on Rawson Street, Auburn, about 1.20am. The next day, a 25-year-old woman was stabbed in her lower back as she got into her car on Liverpool Road. . . Figure 1: Possible event mentions marked in an article from SMH, segmented into news (N) and background (B) event portions. ishman and Sundheim, 1996) selects an event type of which all instances are salient; TDT (Allan, 2002) operates at the document level, which avoids differentiating event mentions; and TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) marks the main event in each sentence. Critiquing ACE05 event detection for not addressing salience, Ji et al. (2009) harness cross-document frequencies for event ranking. Similarly, reference to a previously-reported event implies it is newsworthy. Diversity IE traditionally targets a selected event type (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996). ACE05 considers a broader event typology, dividing eight thematic event types (business, justice, etc.) into 33 subtypes such as attack, die and declare bankruptcy (LDC, 2005). Most subtypes suffer from few annotated instances, while others are impractically broad: sexual abuse, gunfire and the Holocaust each constitute attack instances (is told considered an attack in Figure 1?). Inter-annotator agreement is low for most types.1","While ACE05 would mark the various attack events in our story, police warned would be unrecognised. Despite template adapta-tion (Yangarber et al., 2000; Filatova et al., 2006; Li et al., 2010; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011), event types are brittle to particular tasks and domains, such as bio-text mining (e.g. Kim et al., 2009); they can-not reasonably handle novel events.","1","For binary sentence classification, we calculate an interquartile range of κ ∈ [0.46, 0.64] over the 33 sub-types. Coarse event type classification ranges fromκ = 0.47 for business to κ = 0.69 for conflict. Identity Event coreference is complicated by partitive (sub-event) and logical (e.g. causation) relationships between events, in addition to lexical-semantic and syntactic issues. When considering the relationship between another carjacking and grabbed, drove or stabbed, ACE05 would apply the policy: “When in doubt, do not mark any coreference” (LDC, 2005). Bejan and Harabagiu (2008) consider event coreference across documents, marking the “most important events” (Bejan, 2010), albeit within Google News clusters, where multiple articles reporting the same event are likely to use similar language. Similar challenges apply to identifying event causality and other relations: Bejan and Harabagiu (2008) suggest arcs such as feeding precedes −−−−→","walking enables −−−→","grabbed – akin to instantiations of FrameNet’s frame relations (Fillmore et al., 2003). However, these too are semantically subtle. Explicit reference By considering events through topical document clusters, TDT avoids some challenges of precise identity. It prescribes rules of in-terpretation for which stories pertain to a seminal event. However, the carjackings in our story are neither preconditions nor consequences of a seminal event and so would not constitute a TDT cluster. TDT fails to account for these explicit event references. Though Feng and Allan (2009) and Yang et al. (2009) consider event dependency as directed arcs between documents or paragraphs, they generally retain a broad sense of topic with little attention to explicit reference."]},{"title":"3 The event linking task","paragraphs":["Given an explicit reference to a past event, event linking grounds it in a given news archive. This applies to all events worthy of having been reported, and harnesses explicit reference rather than more general notions of relevance. Though analogous to NEL, our task differs in the types of expressions that may be linked, and the manner of determining the correct KB node to link to, if any. 3.1 Event-referring expressions We consider a subset of newsworthy events – things that happen and directly trigger news – as candidate referents. In TimeML’s event classification (Pustejovsky et al., 2003), newsworthy events would gen-229 erally be occurrence (e.g. die, build, sell) or aspectual (e.g. begin, discontinue), as opposed to percep-tion (e.g. hear), intentional state (e.g. believe), etc. Still, we are not confined to these types when other classes of event are newsworthy. All references must be explicit, reporting the event as factual and completed or ongoing.","Not all event references meeting these criteria are reasonably LINKABLE to a single article: MULTIPLE many distinct events, or an event type,","e.g. world wars, demand; AGGREGATE emerges from other events over time,","e.g. grew 15%, scored 100 goals; COMPLEX an event reported over multiple articles","in terms of its sub-events, e.g. 2012 election,","World Cup, scandal. 3.2 A news archive as a KB We define a canonical link target for each event: the earliest article in the archive that reports the given event happened or is happening. Each archival article implicitly represents zero or more related events, just as Wikipedia entries represent zero or one entity in NEL. Links target the story as a whole: closely related, co-reported events link to the same article, avoiding a problematically strict approach to event identity. An archive reports only selected events, so a valid target may not exist (NEL’s NIL)."]},{"title":"4 An annotated corpus","paragraphs":["We link to a digital archive of the Sydney Morn-ing Herald: Australian and international news from 1986 to 2009, published daily, Monday to Saturday.2 We annotate a randomly sampled corpus of 150 articles from its 2009 News and Features and Business sections including news reports, op-eds and letters.","For this whole-document annotation, a single word of each past/ongoing, newsworthy event mention is marked.3","If LINKABLE, the annotator searches the archive by keyword and date, selecting a target, reported here (a self-referential link) or NIL. An annotation of our example story (Figure 1) would produce five groups of event references (Table 1). 2 The archive may be searched at http://newsstore.","smh.com.au/apps/newsSearch.ac 3 We couple marking and linking since annotators must learn","to judge newsworthiness relative to the target archive.

Pairwise inter-annotator agreement in Table 2 shows that annotators infrequently select the same words to link, but that reasonable agreement on the link target can be achieved for agreed tokens.4","Adjudicator-annotator agreements are generally much higher than inter-annotator agreements: in many cases, an annotator fails to find a target or selects one that does not first report the event; J accepts most annotations as valid. In other cases, there may be multiple articles published on the same day that describe the event in question from different angles; agreement increases substantially when relaxed to accept date agreement. Our adjudicated corpus of 150 documents is summarised in Table 3.","Where a definitive link target is not available, an annotator may erroneously select another candidate: an opinion article describing the event, an article where the event is mentioned as background, or an article anticipating the event.","The task is complicated by changed perspective between an event’s first report and its later reference. 4 κ ≈ F1 for the binary token task (F1 accounts for the ma-","jority class) and for the sparse link targets/date selection. 230 Category Mentions Types Docs Any markable 2136 655 149 LINKABLE 1399 417 144","linked 501 229 99","reported here 667 111 111","nil 231 77 77 COMPLEX 220 79 79 MULTIPLE 328 102 102 AGGREGATE 189 57 57 Table 3: Annotation frequencies: no. of mentions, distinct per document, and document frequency Can overpayed link to what had been acquired?

Adjectival mentions such as Apple’s new CEO are easy to miss and questionably explicit. Events are also confused with facts and abstract entities, such as bans, plans, reports and laws. Unlike many other facts, events can be grounded to a particular time of occurrence, often stated in text."]},{"title":"5 Analysis and discussion","paragraphs":["To assess task feasibility, we present bag-of-words (BoW) and oracle results (Figure 2).

Yang et al. (2009) makes the reasonable assumption that news events generally build on others that recently precede them.

We demonstrate task’s feasibility, with reasonable inter-annotator agreement over a 150 document corpus. The corpus highlights features of the retrieval task and its dependence on temporal knowledge. As well as using event linking to add referentially precise hyperlinks to a news archive, further characteristics of news will emerge by analysing the graph of event references."]},{"title":"7 Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We are grateful to the reviewers for their comments.
