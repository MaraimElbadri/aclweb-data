In this paper, we present an approach to enriching high-order feature representations for graph-based dependency parsing models using a dependency language model and beam search. The dependency language model is built on a large-amount of additional auto-parsed data that is processed by a baseline parser. Based on the dependency language model, we represent a set of features for the parsing model. Finally, the features are efficiently integrated into the parsing model during decoding using beam search. Our approach has two advantages. Firstly we utilize rich high-order features defined over a view of large scope and additional large raw corpus. Secondly our approach does not increase the decoding complexity. We evaluate the proposed approach on English and Chinese data. The experimental results show that our new parser achieves the best accuracy on the Chinese data and comparable accuracy with the best known systems on the English data."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In recent years, there are many data-driven models that have been proposed for dependency parsing (McDonald and Nivre, 2007). Among them, graph-based dependency parsing models have achieved state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of languages as shown in recent CoNLL shared tasks","∗","Corresponding author (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007). In the graph-based models, dependency parsing is treated as a structured prediction problem in which the graphs are usually represented as factored structures. The information of the factored structures decides the features that the models can utilize. There are several previous studies that exploit high-order features that lead to significant improvements.","McDonald et al. (2005) and Covington (2001) develop models that represent first-order features over a single arc in graphs. By extending the first-order model, McDonald and Pereira (2006) and Carreras (2007) exploit second-order features over two adjacent arcs in second-order models. Koo and Collins (2010) further propose a third-order model that uses third-order features. These models utilize higher-order feature representations and achieve better performance than the first-order models. But this achievement is at the cost of the higher decoding complexity, from O(n2",") to O(n4","), where n is the length of the input sentence. Thus, it is very hard to develop higher-order models further in this way.","How to enrich high-order feature representations without increasing the decoding complexity for graph-based models becomes a very challenging problem in the dependency parsing task. In this paper, we solve this issue by enriching the feature representations for a graph-based model using a dependency language model (DLM) (Shen et al., 2008). The N-gram DLM has the ability to predict the next child based on the N-1 immediate previous children and their head (Shen et al., 2008). The basic idea behind is that we use the DLM to evaluate whether a valid dependency tree (McDonald and Nivre, 2007) 213 is well-formed from a view of large scope. The parsing model searches for the final dependency trees by considering the original scores and the scores of DLM.","In our approach, the DLM is built on a large amount of auto-parsed data, which is processed by an original first-order parser (McDonald et al., 2005). We represent the features based on the DLM. The DLM-based features can capture the N-gram information of the parent-children structures for the parsing model. Then, they are integrated directly in the decoding algorithms using beam-search. Our new parsing model can utilize rich high-order feature representations but without increasing the complexity.","To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct experiments on English and Chinese data. The results indicate that the approach greatly improves the accuracy. In summary, we make the following contributions:","• We utilize the dependency language model to enhance the graph-based parsing model. The DLM-based features are integrated directly into the beam-search decoder.","• The new parsing model uses the rich high-order features defined over a view of large scope and and additional large raw corpus, but without increasing the decoding complexity.","• Our parser achieves the best accuracy on the Chinese data and comparable accuracy with the best known systems on the English data."]},{"title":"2 Dependency language model","paragraphs":["Language models play a very important role for statistical machine translation (SMT). The standard N-gram based language model predicts the next word based on the N −1 immediate previous words. However, the traditional N-gram language model can not capture long-distance word relations. To over-come this problem, Shen et al. (2008) proposed a dependency language model (DLM) to exploit long-distance word relations for SMT. The N-gram DLM predicts the next child of a head based on the N − 1 immediate previous children and the head itself. In this paper, we define a DLM, which is similar to the one of Shen et al. (2008), to score entire dependency trees.","An input sentence is denoted by x = (x0, x1, ..., xi, ..., xn), where x0 = ROOT and does not depend on any other token in x and each token xi refers to a word. Let y be a dependency tree for x and H(y) be a set that includes the words that have at least one dependent. For each xh ∈ H(y), we have a dependency structure Dh = (xLk, ...xL1, xh, xR1...xRm), where xLk, ...xL1 are the children on the left side from the farthest to the nearest and xR1...xRm are the children on the right side from the nearest to the farthest. Probability P (Dh) is defined as follows: P (Dh) = PL(Dh) × PR(Dh) (1) Here PL and PR are left and right side generative probabilities respectively. Suppose, we use a N-gram dependency language model. PL is defined as follows: PL(Dh) ≈ PLc(xL1|xh) ×PLc(xL2|xL1, xh) ×... (2) ×PLc(xLk|xL(k−1), ..., xL(k−N+1), xh) where the approximation is based on the nth order Markov assumption. The right side probability is similar. For a dependency tree, we calculate the probability as follows: P (y) = ∏ xh∈H(y) P (Dh) (3)","In this paper, we use a linear model to calculate the scores for the parsing models (defined in Section 3.1). Accordingly, we reform Equation 3. We define fDLM as a high-dimensional feature representation which is based on arbitrary features of PLc, PRc and x. Then, the DLM score of tree y is in turn computed as the inner product of fDLM","with a corresponding weight vector wDLM",".","scoreDLM","(y) = fDLM","· wDLM","(4)"]},{"title":"3 Parsing with dependency language model","paragraphs":["In this section, we propose a parsing model which includes the dependency language model by extending the model of McDonald et al. (2005). 214 3.1 Graph-based parsing model The graph-based parsing model aims to search for the maximum spanning tree (MST) in a graph (McDonald et al., 2005). We write (xi, xj ) ∈ y if there is a dependency in tree y from word xi to word xj (xi is the head and xj is the dependent). A graph, denoted by Gx, consists of a set of nodes Vx = {x0, x1, ..., xi, ..., xn} and a set of arcs (edges) Ex = {(xi, xj )|i ̸= j, xi ∈ Vx, xj ∈ (Vx − x0)}, where the nodes in Vx are the words in x. Let T (Gx) be the set of all the subgraphs of Gx that are valid dependency trees (McDonald and Nivre, 2007) for sentence x.","The formulation defines the score of a dependency tree y ∈ T (Gx) to be the sum of the edge scores, s(x, y) = ∑ g∈y score(w, x, g) (5) where g is a spanning subgraph of y. g can be a single dependency or adjacent dependencies. Then y is represented as a set of factors. The model scores each factor using a weight vector w that contains the weights for the features to be learned during training using the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) (Crammer and Singer, 2003; McDonald and Pereira, 2006). The scoring function is score(w, x, g) = f(x, g) · w (6) where f(x, g) is a high-dimensional feature representation which is based on arbitrary features of g and x.","The parsing model finds a maximum spanning tree (MST), which is the highest scoring tree in T (Gx).

Figure 1 illustrates the changes. In the original first-order parsing model, we only utilize the information of single arc (xh, xL(k−1)) for xL(k−1) as shown in Figure 1-(a). If we use 3-gram DLM, we can utilize the additional information of the two previous children (nearer to xh than xL(k−1)): xL(k−2) and xL(k−3) as shown in Figure 1-(b). Figure 1: Adding the DLM scores to the parsing model 3.3 DLM-based feature templates We define DLM-based features for Dh = (xLk, ...xL1, xh, xR1...xRm). For each child xch on the left side, we have PLc(xch|HIS), where HIS refers to the N − 1 immediate previous right children and head xh. Similarly, we have PRc(xch|HIS) for each child on the right side. Let Pu(xch|HIS) (Pu(ch) in short) be one of the above probabilities. We use the map function Φ(Pu(ch)) to obtain the predefined discrete value (defined in Section 5.3). The feature templates are outlined in Table 1, where TYPE refers to one of the types:PL or PR, h pos refers to the part-of-speech tag of xh, h word refers to the lexical form of xh, ch pos refers to the part-of-speech tag of xch, and ch word refers to the lexical form of xch."]},{"title":"4 Decoding","paragraphs":["In this section, we turn to the problem of adding the DLM in the decoding algorithm. We propose two ways: (1) Rescoring, in which we rescore the K-best list with the DLM-based features; (2) Intersect, 215 < Φ(Pu(ch)), TYPE > < Φ(Pu(ch)), TYPE, h pos > < Φ(Pu(ch)), TYPE, h word > < Φ(Pu(ch)), TYPE, ch pos > < Φ(Pu(ch)), TYPE, ch word > < Φ(Pu(ch)), TYPE, h pos, ch pos > < Φ(Pu(ch)), TYPE, h word, ch word > Table 1: DLM-based feature templates in which we add the DLM-based features in the decoding algorithm directly. 4.1 Rescoring We add the DLM-based features into the decoding procedure by using the rescoring technique used in (Shen et al., 2008). We can use an original parser to produce the K-best list. This method has the potential to be very fast. However, because the performance of this method is restricted to the K-best list, we may have to set K to a high number in order to find the best parsing tree (with DLM) or a tree acceptably close to the best (Shen et al., 2008). 4.2 Intersect Then, we add the DLM-based features in the decoding algorithm directly. The DLM-based features are generated online during decoding.","For our parser, we use the decoding algorithm of McDonald et al. (2005). The algorithm was extensions of the parsing algorithm of (Eisner, 1996), which was a modified version of the CKY chart parsing algorithm. Here, we describe how to add the DLM-based features in the first-order algorithm. The second-order and higher-order algorithms can be extended by the similar way.","The parsing algorithm independently parses the left and right dependents of a word and combines them later. There are two types of chart items (McDonald and Pereira, 2006): 1) a complete item in which the words are unable to accept more dependents in a certain direction; and 2) an incomplete item in which the words can accept more dependents in a certain direction. In the algorithm, we create both types of chart items with two directions for all the word pairs in a given sentence. The direction of a dependency is from the head to the dependent. The right (left) direction indicates the dependent is on the right (left) side of the head. Larger chart items are created from pairs of smaller ones in a bottom-up style. In the following figures, complete items are represented by triangles and incomplete items are represented by trapezoids. Figure 2 illustrates the cubic parsing actions of the algorithm (Eisner, 1996) in the right direction, where s, r, and t refer to the start and end indices of the chart items. In Figure 2-(a), all the items on the left side are complete and the algorithm creates the incomplete item (trapezoid on the right side) of s – t. This action builds a dependency relation from s to t. In Figure 2-(b), the item of s – r is incomplete and the item of r – t is complete. Then the algorithm creates the complete item of s – t. In this action, all the children of r are generated. In Figure 2, the longer vertical edge in a triangle or a trapezoid corresponds to the subroot of the structure (spanning chart). For example, s is the subroot of the span s – t in Figure 2-(a). For the left direction case, the actions are similar. Figure 2: Cubic parsing actions of Eisner (Eisner, 1996)","Then, we add the DLM-based features into the parsing actions. Because the parsing algorithm is in the bottom-up style, the nearer children are generated earlier than the farther ones of the same head. Thus, we calculate the left or right side probability for a new child when a new dependency relation is built. For Figure 2-(a), we add the features of PRc(xt|HIS). Figure 3 shows the structure, where cRs refers to the current children (nearer than xt) of xs. In the figure, HIS includes cRs and xs. Figure 3: Add DLM-based features in cubic parsing 216","We use beam search to choose the one having the overall best score as the final parse, where K spans are built at each step (Zhang and Clark, 2008). At each step, we perform the parsing actions in the current beam and then choose the best K resulting spans for the next step. The time complexity of the new decoding algorithm is O(Kn3",") while the original one is O(n3","), where n is the length of the input sentence. With the rich feature set in Table 1, the running time of Intersect is longer than the time of Rescoring. But Intersect considers more combination of spans with the DLM-based features than Rescoring that is only given a K-best list."]},{"title":"5 Implementation Details 5.1 Baseline parser","paragraphs":["We implement our parsers based on the MSTParser1",", a freely available implementation of the graph-based model proposed by (McDonald and Pereira, 2006). We train a first-order parser on the training data (described in Section 6.1) with the features defined in McDonald et al. (2005). We call this first-order parser Baseline parser. 5.2 Build dependency language models We use a large amount of unannotated data to build the dependency language model. We first perform word segmentation (if needed) and part-of-speech tagging. After that, we obtain the word-segmented sentences with the part-of-speech tags.

We used the MMA system (Kruengkrai et al., 2009) trained on the training data to perform word segmentation and POS tagging and used the Baseline parser to parse all the sentences in the data. 6.2 Features for basic and enhanced parsers The previous studies have defined four types of features: (FT1) the first-order features defined in McDonald et al. (2005), (FT2SB) the second-order parent-siblings features defined in McDonald and Pereira (2006), (FT2GC) the second-order parent-child-grandchild features defined in Carreras (2007), and (FT3) the third-order features defined in (Koo and Collins, 2010).","We used the first- and second-order parsers of the MSTParser as the basic parsers. Then we enhanced them with other higher-order features using beam-search. Table 2 shows the feature settings of the systems, where MST1/2 refers to the basic first-/second-order parser and MSTB1/2 refers to the enhanced first-/second-order parser. MSTB1 and MSTB2 used the same feature setting, but used different order models. This resulted in the difference of using FT2SB (beam-search in MSTB1 vs exact-inference in MSTB2). We used these four parsers as the Baselines in the experiments.
