When a sentence and a knowledge base refer to the same entity pair, this approach heuristically labels the sentence with the corresponding relation in the knowledge base. However, this heuristic can fail with the result that some sentences are labeled wrongly. This noisy labeled data causes poor extraction performance. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the number of wrong labels. We present a novel generative model that directly models the heuristic labeling process of distant supervision. The model predicts whether assigned labels are correct or wrong via its hidden variables.

Supervised approaches are limited in scalability because labeled data is expensive to produce. A particularly attractive approach, called distant supervision (DS), creates labeled data by heuristically aligning entities in text with those in a knowledge base, such as Freebase (Mintz et al., 2009).","","","","","","","       ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","   ","","","","","","","","","","","","",""," ","         ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","   ","","","","","","","   ","","","","","","","","","","","   ","","","","","","","","","","","","         Figure 1: Automatic labeling by distant supervision. Upper sentence: correct labeling; lower sentence: incorrect labeling. With DS it is assumed that if a sentence contains an entity pair in a knowledge base, such a sentence actually expresses the corresponding relation in the knowledge base.","However, the DS assumption can fail, which results in noisy labeled data and this causes poor extraction performance. An entity pair in a target text generally expresses more than one relation while a knowledge base stores a subset of the relations. The assumption ignores this possibility. For instance, consider the place of birth relation between Michael Jackson and Gary in Figure 1. The upper sentence indeed expresses the place of birth relation between the two entities. In DS place of birth is assigned to the sentence, and it becomes a useful training example. On the other hand, the lower sentence does not express this relation between the two entities, but the DS heuristic wrongly labels the sentence as expressing it.","Riedel et al. (2010) relax the DS assumption as at least one sentence containing an entity pair ex-721 pressing the corresponding relation in the knowledge base. They cast the relaxed assumption as multi-instance learning. However, even the relaxed assumption can fail. The relaxation is equivalent to the DS assumption when a labeled pair of entities is mentioned once in a target corpus (Riedel et al., 2010). In fact, 91.7% of entity pairs appear only once in Wikipedia articles (see Section 7).","In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the number of wrong labels generated by DS without using either of these assumptions. Given the labeled corpus created with the DS assumption, we first predict whether each pattern, which frequently appears in text to express a relation (see Section 4), expresses a target relation. Patterns that are predicted not to express the relation are used to form a negative pattern list for removing wrong labels of the relation.","The main contributions of this paper are as follows:","• To make the pattern prediction, we propose a generative model that directly models the process of automatic labeling in DS. Without any strong assumptions like Riedel et al. (2010)’s, the model predicts whether each pattern expresses each relation via hidden variables (see Section 5).","• Our variational inference for our generative model lets us automatically calibrate parameters for each relation, which are sensitive to the performance (see Section 6).","• We applied our method to Wikipedia articles using Freebase as a knowledge base and found that (i) our model identified patterns expressing a given relation more accurately than baseline methods and (ii) our method led to better extraction performance than the original DS (Mintz et al., 2009) and MultiR (Hoffmann et al., 2011), which is a state-of-the-art multi-instance learning system for relation extraction (see Section 7)."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["The increasingly popular approach, called distant supervision (DS), or weak supervision, utilizes a knowledge base to heuristically label a corpus (Wu and Weld, 2007; Bellare and McCallum, 2007; Pal et al., 2007). Our work was inspired by Mintz et al. (2009) who used Freebase as a knowledge base by making the DS assumption and trained relation extractors on Wikipedia. Previous works (Hoffmann et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2010) have pointed out that the DS assumption generates noisy labeled data, but did not directly address the problem. Wang et al. (2011) applied a rule-based method to the problem by using popular entity types and keywords for each relation. In (Bellare and McCallum, 2007; Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011), they used multi-instance learning, which deals with uncertainty of labels, to relax the DS assumption. However, the relaxed assumption can fail when a labeled entity pair is mentioned only once in a corpus (Riedel et al., 2010). Our approach relies on neither of these assumptions.","Bootstrapping for relation extraction (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006; Carlson et al., 2010) is related to our method. In bootstrapping, seed entity pairs of the target relation are given in order to select reliable patterns, which are used to extract new entity pairs. To avoid the selec-tion of unreliable patterns, bootstrapping introduces scoring functions for each pattern candidate. This can be applied to our approach, which seeks to reduce the number of unreliable patterns by using a set of given entity pairs. However, the bootstrapping-like approach suffers from sensitive parameters that are critical to its performance. Ideally, the parameters such as a threshold for scoring function should be determined for each relation, but there are no principled methods (Komachi et al., 2008). In our approach, parameters are calibrated for each relation by maximizing the likelihood of our generative model."]},{"title":"3 Knowledge-based Distant Supervision","paragraphs":["In this section, we describe DS for relation extraction. We use the term relation as the relation between two entities. A relation instance is a tuple consisting of two entities and relation r. For example, place of birth(Michael Jackson, Gary) in Figure 1 is a relation instance.","Relation extraction seeks to extract relation instances from text. An entity is mentioned as a named entity in text. We extract a relation instance from a 722 single sentence. For example, from the upper sentence in Figure 1 we extract place of birth(Michael Jackson, Gary). Since two entities mentioned in a sentence do not always have a relation, we select entity pairs from a corpus when: (i) the path of the dependency parse tree between the corresponding two named entities in the sentence is no longer than 4 and (ii) the path does not contain a sentence-like boundary, such as a relative clause1","(Banko et al., 2007; Banko and Etzioni, 2008). Banko and Etzioni (2008) found that a set of eight lexico-syntactic forms covers nearly 95% of relation phrases in their corpus. (Fader et al. (2011) found that this set covers 69% of their corpus). Our rule is designed to cover at least the eight lexico-syntactic forms. We use the entity pairs extracted by this rule.","DS uses a knowledge base to create labeled data for relation extraction by heuristically matching entity pairs. A knowledge base is a set of relation instances about predefined relations. For each sentence in the corpus, we extract all of its entity pairs. Then, for each entity pair, we try to retrieve the relation instances about the entity pair from the knowledge base. If we found such a relation instance, then the set of its relation, the entity pair, and the sentence is stored as a positive example. If not, then the set of the entity pair and the sentence is stored as a negative example. Features of an entity pair are extracted from the sentence containing the entity pair.","As mentioned in Section 1, the assumption of DS can fail, resulting in wrong assignments of a relation to sentences that do not express the relation. We call such assignments wrong labels. An example of a wrong label is place of birth assigned to the lower sentence in Figure 1."]},{"title":"4 Wrong Label Reduction","paragraphs":["We define a pattern as the entity types of an entity pair2","as well as the sequence of words on the path of the dependency parse tree from the first entity to the second one.

We would like to remove place of death from the sentences that contain this pattern.","In our method, we reduce the number of wrong labels as follows: (i) given a labeled corpus with the DS assumption, we first predict whether a pattern expresses a relation and then (ii) remove wrong labels using the negative pattern list, which is defined as patterns that are predicted not to express the relation. In the first step, we introduce the novel generative model that directly models DS’s labeling process and make the prediction (see Section 5). The second step is formally described in Algorithm 1.

The former is simply parameterized as 0 ≤ ar ≤ 1. We express the latter as brs = P (xrsi = 1|Zr, ar, dr, λ, M), which is a function of Zr, ar, dr, λ and M; we explain its modeling in the following two subsections. 3","Since a set of entity pairs appearing with pattern s is different, i should be written as is.

Elements in E1 are labeled with probability ar = 3/6 = 0.5. Those in E2 are labeled with probability br2 = ar(|E1 ∩ E2|/|E2|) = 0.5(2/4) = 0.25.","The graphical model of our model is shown in Figure 2. 5.1 Example of Wrong Labeling Using a simple example, we describe how we model brs, the probability with which DS assigns relation r to pattern s via entity pairs when pattern s does not express relation r.","Consider two patterns: pattern 1 that expresses relation r and pattern 2 that does not (i.e., zr1 = 1 and zr2 = 0). We also assume that there are entity pairs that appear with pattern 1 as well as with pattern 2 in different places in the corpus (for example, Michael Jackson and Gary in Figure 1). When such entity pairs are labeled, relation r is assigned to pattern 1 and at the same time to wrong pattern 2. Such entity pairs are observed as elements in the intersection of the two sets of entity pairs, E1 and E2. Here, Es is the set of entity pairs that appear with pattern s in the corpus. This situation is described in Figure 3.","We model probability br2 as follows. In E1, an entity pair is labeled with probability ar. We assume that entity pairs in the intersection, E1 ∩ E2, are also labeled with ar. From the viewpoint of E2, entity pairs in its subset, E1 ∩ E2, are labeled with ar. Therefore, br2 is modeled as br2 = ar","|E1 ∩ E2| |E2| , where |E| denotes the number of elements in set E. An example of this calculation is shown in Figure 3. 724 We generalize the example in the next subsection. 5.2 Modeling of Probability brs We model brs so that it is proportional to the number of entity pairs that are shared with correct patterns whose zrs = 1, i.e., brs = ar ∣ ∣ ∣ ( ⋂ {t|zrt=1,t̸=s} Et ) ∩ Es ∣ ∣ ∣ |Es| , (1) where ⋂","indicates set intersections.

We approximate the righthand side of Eq.1 as brs ≈ ar  1 − S ∏ t=1,t̸=s ( 1 −","|Et ∩ Es| |Es| ) zrt   . This approximation is made, given the sizes of all Ess and those of all intersections of two Ess. This has a lower computational cost of O(S) and let us use less memory. We define S × S matrix M whose elements are mst = |Et ∩ Es|/|Es|.","In reality, factors other than the process described in the previous subsection can cause wrong labeling (for example, errors in the knowledge base).

However, this calculation is intractable because each zrs depends on the others, {(zrt)|t ̸= s}, as shown in Eqs.2 and 3. This prevents us from using the EM algorithm. Instead, we apply variational approximation to the posterior distribution by using the following trial distribution: Q (Zr|Φr) = S ∏ s=1 φzrs rs (1 − φrs)1−zrs",", where 0 ≤ φrs ≤ 1 is a parameter for the trial distribution.","The following function Fr is a lower bound of the log likelihood, and maximizing this function with respect to Φr is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence between the trial distribution and the posterior distribution of Zr. Fr = EQ[log P (Zr, Xr|θr, ar, dr, λ, M)] − EQ [log Q (Zr|Φr)] . (4) EQ[•] represents the expectation over trial distribution Q. We maximize function Fr with respect to the parameters instead of the log likelihood.","However, we need further approximation for two terms on expanding Eq.4. Both of the terms are expressed as EQ[log(f (Zr))], where f (Zr) is a function of Zr. We apply the following approximation (Asuncion et al., 2009). EQ [log(f (Zr))] ≈ log (EQ [f (Zr)]) . 725 This is based on the Taylor series of log at EQ[f (Zr)]. In our problem, since the second derivative is sufficiently small, we use the zeroth-order approximation.4","Our learning algorithm is derived by calculating the stationary condition of the resultant evaluation function with respect to each parameter. We have the exact solution for θr. For each φrs and dr, we derive a fixed point iteration. We update ar by using the steepest ascent. We update each parameter in turn while keeping the other parameters fixed. Parameter updating proceeds until a termination condition is met.","After learning, we have φrs for each pair of relation r and pattern s. The greater the value of φrs is, the more likely it is that pattern s expresses relation r. We set a threshold and determine zrs = 0 when φrs is less than the threshold."]},{"title":"7 Experiments","paragraphs":["We performed two sets of experiments.

In our method, we trained a classifier with a labeled corpus cleaned by Algorithm 1 using the negative pattern list predicted by the generative model. 7.1 Dataset Following Mintz et al. (2009), we carried out our experiments using Wikipedia as the target corpus and Freebase (September, 2009, (Google, 2009)) as the knowledge base. We used more than 1,300,000 Wikipedia articles in the wex dump data (September, 2009, (Metaweb Technologies, 2009)).

In Experiment 1, since we needed entity types for patterns, we restricted ourselves to entities matched with Freebase, which also provides entity types for entities. We used patterns that appear more than 20 times in the corpus. 7.2.1 Evaluation","We split the data into training data and test data. The training data was Xrs for 12 relations and the test data was that for the remaining 12 relations. The training data was used to calibrate parameters (see the following subsection for details). The test data was used for evaluation. We randomly split the data five times and took the average of the following evaluation values.","We evaluated the performance by precision, recall, and F value. They were calculated using gold standard data, which was constructed by hand.

Ratio-based Selection (RS): Given relation r and pattern s, this method calculates nrs/Ns, which is the ratio of the number of labeled entity pairs appearing with pattern s to the number of entity pairs including unlabeled ones. RS then selects the top n patterns (RS(rank)). We also tested a version using a real-valued threshold (RS(value)). In training, we selected the threshold that maximized the F value. Some bootstrapping approaches (Carlson et al., 2010) use a rank-based threshold like RS(rank). Proposed Model (PROP): Using the training data, we determined the two hyperparameters, λ and the threshold to round φrs to 1 or 0, so that they maximized the F value. When φrs is greater than the threshold, we select pattern s as one expressing relation r. 7.2.3 Result and Discussion","The results of Experiment 1 are shown in Table 2.
