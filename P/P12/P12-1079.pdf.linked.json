To exploit topic information for statistical machine translation (SMT), researchers have proposed various topic-specific lexicon translation models (Zhao and Xing, 2006; Zhao and Xing, 2007; Tam et al., 2007) to improve translation quality.","Topic-specific lexicon translation models focus on word-level translations. Such models first estimate word translation probabilities conditioned on topics, and then adapt lexical weights of phrases","∗","Corresponding author by these probabilities. However, the state-of-the-art SMT systems translate sentences by using sequences of synchronous rules or phrases, instead of translating word by word. Since a synchronous rule is rarely factorized into individual words, we believe that it is more reasonable to incorporate the topic model directly at the rule level rather than the word level.","Consequently, we propose a topic similarity model for hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2007), where each synchronous rule is as-sociated with a topic distribution. In particular,","• Given a document to be translated, we calculate the topic similarity between a rule and the document based on their topic distributions.

Both Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999) are types of topic models. LDA is the most common topic model currently in use, therefore we exploit it for mining topics in this pa-per. Here, we first give a brief description of LDA.","LDA views each document as a mixture pro-portion of various topics, and generates each word by multinomial distribution conditioned on a topic. More specifically, as a generative process, LDA first samples a document-topic distribution for each document. Then, for each word in the document, it samples a topic index from the document-topic distribution and samples the word conditioned on the topic index according the topic-word distribution.","Generally speaking, LDA contains two types of parameters. The first one relates to the document-topic distribution, which records the topic distribution of each document. The second one is used for topic-word distribution, which represents each topic as a distribution over words. Based on these parameters (and some hyper-parameters), LDA can infer a topic assignment for each word in the documents. In the following sections, we will use these parameters and the topic assignments of words to estimate the parameters in our method."]},{"title":"3 Topic Similarity Model","paragraphs":["Sentences should be translated in consistence with their topics (Zhao and Xing, 2006; Zhao and Xing, 2007; Tam et al., 2007). In the hierarchical phrase based system, a synchronous rule may be related to some topics and unrelated to others. In terms of probability, a rule often has an uneven probability distribution over topics. The probability over a topic is high if the rule is highly related to the topic, other-wise the probability will be low. Therefore, we use topic distribution to describe the relatedness of rules to topics.","Figure 1 shows four synchronous rules (Chiang, 2007) with topic distributions, some of which contain nonterminals. We can see that, although the source part of rule (b) and (c) are identical, their topic distributions are quite different. Rule (b) contains a highest probability on the topic about “China-U.S. relationship”, which means rule (b) is much more related to this topic. In contrast, rule (c) contains an even distribution over various topics. Thus, given a document about “China-U.S. relationship”, we hope to encourage the system to apply rule (b) but penalize the application of rule (c). We achieve this by calculating similarity between the topic distributions of a rule and a document to be translated.","More formally, we associate each rule with a rule-topic distribution P (z|r), where r is a rule, and z is a topic. Suppose there are K topics, this distribution 751 can be represented by a K-dimension vector. The k-th component P (z = k|r) means the probability of topic k given the rule r. The estimation of such distribution will be described in Section 4.","Analogously, we represent the topic information of a document d to be translated by a document-topic distribution P (z|d), which is also a K-dimension vector. The k-th dimension P (z = k|d) means the probability of topic k given document d. Different from rule-topic distribution, the document-topic distribution can be directly inferred by an off-the-shelf LDA tool.","Consequently, based on these two distributions, we select a rule for a document to be translated according to their topic similarity (Section 3.1), which measures the relatedness of the rule to the document. In order to encourage the application of generic rules which are often penalized by our similarity model, we also propose a topic sensitivity model (Section 3.2). 3.1 Topic Similarity By comparing the similarity of their topic distributions, we are able to decide whether a rule is suitable for a given source document. The topic similarity computes the distance of two topic distributions. We calculate the topic similarity by Hellinger function: Similarity(P (z|d), P (z|r)) = K ∑ k=1 ( √ P (z = k|d) −√ P (z = k|r)) 2 (1) Hellinger function is used to calculate distribution distance and is popular in topic model (Blei and Lafferty, 2007).1","By topic similarity, we aim to encourage or penalize the application of a rule for a given document according to their topic distributions, which then helps the SMT system make better translation decisions. 3.2 Topic Sensitivity Domain adaptation (Wu et al., 2008; Bertoldi and Federico, 2009) often distinguishes general-domain data from in-domain data. Similarly, we divide the rules into topic-insensitive rules and topic-sensitive","1","We also try other distance functions, including Euclidean distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence and cosine function. They produce similar results in our preliminary experiments. rules according to their topic distributions. Let’s revisit Figure 1. We can easily find that the topic distribution of rule (c) distribute evenly. This in-dicates that it is insensitive to topics, and can be applied in any topics. We call such a rule a topic-insensitive rule. In contrast, the distributions of the rest rules peak on a few topics. Such rules are called topic-sensitive rules. Generally speaking, a topic-insensitive rule has a fairly flat distribution, while a topic-sensitive rule has a sharp distribution.","A document typically focuses on a few topics, and has a sharp topic distribution. In contrast, the distribution of topic-insensitive rule is fairly flat. Hence, a topic-insensitive rule is always less similar to documents and is punished by the similarity function.","However, topic-insensitive rules may be more preferable than topic-sensitive rules if neither of them are similar to given documents. For a document about the “military” topic, the rule (b) and (c) in Figure 1 are both dissimilar to the document, because rule (b) relates to the “China-U.S. relationship” topic and rule (c) is topic-insensitive. Nevertheless, since rule (c) occurs more frequently across various topics, it may be better to apply rule (c).","To address such issue of the topic similarity model, we further introduce a topic sensitivity model to describe the topic sensitivity of a rule using entropy as a metric: Sensitivity(P (z|r)) = − K ∑ k=1 P (z = k|r) × log (P (z = k|r)) (2) According to the Eq. (2), a topic-insensitive rule has a large entropy, while a topic-sensitive rule has a smaller entropy. By incorporating the topic sensitivity model with the topic similarity model, we enable our SMT system to balance the selection of these two types of rules. Given rules with approximately equal values of Eq. (1), we prefer topic-insensitive rules."]},{"title":"4 Estimation","paragraphs":["Unlike document-topic distribution that can be directly learned by LDA tools, we need to estimate the rule-topic distribution according to our requirement. In this paper, we try to exploit the topic information 752 of both source and target language. To achieve this goal, we use both source-side and target-side monolingual topic models, and learn the correspondence between the two topic models from word-aligned bilingual corpus.","Specifically, we use two types of rule-topic distributions: one is source-side rule-topic distribution and the other is target-side rule-topic distribution. These two rule-topic distributions are estimated by corresponding topic models in the same way (Section 4.1). Notably, only source language documents are available during decoding. In order to compute the similarity between the target-side topic distribution of a rule and the source-side topic distribution of a given document,we need to project the target-side topic distribution of a synchronous rule into the space of the source-side topic model (Section 4.2).","A more principle way is to learn a bilingual topic model from bilingual corpus (Mimno et al., 2009). However, we may face difficulty during decoding, where only source language documents are available. It requires a marginalization to infer the monolingual topic distribution using the bilingual topic model. The high complexity of marginalization prohibits such a summation in practice. Previous work on bilingual topic model avoid this problem by some monolingual assumptions. Zhao and Xing (2007) assume that the topic model is generated in a monolingual manner, while Tam et al., (2007) construct their bilingual topic model by enforcing a one-to-one correspondence between two monolingual topic models. We also estimate our rule-topic distribution by two monolingual topic models, but use a different way to project target-side topics onto source-side topics. 4.1 Monolingual Topic Distribution Estimation We estimate rule-topic distribution from word-aligned bilingual training corpus with document boundaries explicitly given. The source and target side distributions are estimated in the same way. For simplicity, we only describe the estimation of source-side distribution in this section.","The process of rule-topic distribution estimation is analogous to the traditional estimation of rule translation probability (Chiang, 2007). In addition to the word-aligned corpus, the input for estimation also contains the source-side topic-document distribution of every documents inferred by LDA tool.","We first extract synchronous rules from training data in a traditional way. When a rule r is extracted from a document d with topic distribution P (z|d), we collect an instance (r, P (z|d), c), where c is the fraction count of an instance as described in Chiang, (2007). After extraction, we get a set of instances I = {(r, P (z|d), c)} with different document-topic distributions for each rule. Using these instances, we calculate the topic probability P (z = k|r) as follows: P (z = k|r) =","∑ I∈I c × P (z = k|d)","∑K k′ =1","∑ I∈I c × P (z = k′","|d) (3)","By using both source-side and target-side document-topic distribution, we obtain two rule-topic distributions for each rule in total. 4.2 Target-side Topic Distribution Projection As described in the previous section, we also estimate the target-side rule-topic distribution. However, only source document-topic distributions are available during decoding. In order to calculate the similarity between the target-side rule-topic distribution of a rule and the source-side document-topic distribution of a source document, we need to project target-side topics into the source-side topic space. The projection contains two steps:","• In the first step, we learn the topic-to-topic correspondence probability p(zf |ze) from target-side topic ze to source-side topic zf .","• In the second step, we project the target-side topic distribution of a rule into source-side topic space using the correspondence probability.","In the first step, we estimate the correspondence probability by the co-occurrence of the source-side and the target-side topic assignment of the word-aligned corpus. The topic assignments are output by LDA tool. Thus, we denotes each sentence pair by (zf , ze, a), where zf and ze are the topic assignments of source-side and target-side sentences respectively, and a is a set of links {(i, j)}. A link (i, j) means a source-side position i aligns to a target-side position j. Thus, the co-occurrence of a source-side topic with index kf and a target-side 753 e-topic f-topic 1 f-topic 2 f-topic 3 enterprises 农业(agricultural) 企业(enterprise) 发展(develop) rural 农村(rural) 市场(market) 经济(economic) state 农民(peasant) 国有(state) 科技(technology ) agricultural 改革(reform) 公司(company) 我国(China) market 财政(finance) 金融(finance) 技术(technique) reform 社会(social) 银行(bank) 产业(industry) production 保障(safety) 投资(investment) 结构(structure) peasants 调整(adjust) 管理(manage) 创新(innovation) owned 政策(policy) 改革(reform) 加快(accelerate) enterprise 收入(income) 经营(operation) 改革(reform) p(zf|ze) 0.38 0.28 0.16 Table 1: Example of topic-to-topic correspondence.

We then compute the probability of P (z = kf |z = ke) by normalizing the co-occurrence count. Overall, after the first step, we obtain an correspondence matrix MKe×Kf from target-side topic to source-side topic, where the item Mi,j represents the probability P (zf = i|ze = j).","In the second step, given the correspondence matrix MKe×Kf , we project the target-side rule-topic distribution P (ze|r) to the source-side topic space by multiplication as follows: T (P (ze|r)) = P (ze|r) ⊗ MKe×Kf (5) In this way, we get a second distribution for a rule in the source-side topic space, which we called projected target-side topic distribution T (P (ze|r)).","Obviously, our projection method allows one target-side topic to align to multiple source-side topics. This is different from the one-to-one correspondence used by Tam et al., (2007). From the training result of the correspondence matrix MKe×Kf , we find that the topic correspondence between source and target language is not necessarily one-to-one. Typically, the probability P (z = kf |z = ke) of a target-side topic mainly distributes on two or three source-side topics. Table 1 shows an example of a target-side topic with its three mainly aligned source-side topics."]},{"title":"5 Decoding","paragraphs":["We incorporate our topic similarity model as a new feature into a traditional hiero system (Chiang, 2007) under discriminative framework (Och and Ney, 2002).

During decoding, we first infer the topic distribution P (zf |d) for a given document on source language. When applying a rule, it is straightforward to calculate these topic features. Obviously, the computational cost of these features is rather small.","In the topic-specific lexicon translation model, given a source document, it first calculates the topic-specific translation probability by normalizing the entire lexicon translation table, and then adapts the lexical weights of rules correspondingly. This makes the decoding slower.

The bilingual training data contains 239K sentence pairs with 6.9M Chinese words and 9.14M English words, which comes from the FBIS portion of LDC data. There are 10,947 documents in the FBIS corpus. The monolingual data for training English language model includes the Xinhua portion of the GIGAWORD corpus, which contains 238M English words. We used the NIST evaluation set of 2005 (MT05) as our development set, and sets of MT06/MT08 as test sets. The numbers of documents in MT05, MT06, MT08 are 100, 79, and 109 respectively.","We obtained symmetric word alignments of training data by first running GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) in both directions and then applying refinement rule “grow-diag-final-and” (Koehn et al., 2003). The SCFG rules are extracted from this word-aligned training data. A 4-gram language model was trained on the monolingual data by the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002). Case-insensitive NIST BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) was used to measure translation performance. We used minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) for optimizing the feature weights.","For the topic model, we used the open source LDA tool GibbsLDA++ for estimation and inference.3 GibssLDA++ is an implementation of LDA using gibbs sampling for parameter estimation and infer-ence.

We set the number of topic K = 30 for both source-side and target-side, and use the default setting of the tool for training and inference.4","During decoding, we first infer the topic distribution of given documents before translation according to the topic model trained on Chinese part of FBIS corpus. 6.2 Effect of Topic Similarity Model We compare our method with two baselines. In addition to the traditional hiero system, we also compare with the topic-specific lexicon translation method in Zhao and Xing (2007). The lexicon translation probability is adapted by: p(f |e, DF ) ∝ p(e|f, DF )P (f |DF ) (6) = ∑ k p(e|f, z = k)p(f |z = k)p(z = k|DF ) (7) However, we simplify the estimation of p(e|f, z = k) by directly using the word alignment corpus with 3 http://gibbslda.sourceforge.net/ 4 We determine K by testing {15, 30, 50, 100, 200} in our","preliminary experiments.

Our method also outperforms the topic-lexicon specific translation method by 0.47 points. This verifies that topic similarity model can improve the translation quality significantly.","In order to gain insights into why our model is helpful, we further investigate how many rules are topic-sensitive. As described in Section 3.2, we use entropy to measure the topic sensitivity. If the entropy of a rule is smaller than a certain threshold, then the rule is topic sensitive. Since documents often focus on some topics, we use the average entropy of document-topic distribution of all training documents as the threshold. We compare both source-side and target-side distribution shown in Table 3. We find that more than 80 percents of the rules are topic-sensitive, thus provides us a large space to improve the translation by exploiting topics.","We also compare these methods in terms of the decoding speed (words/second).

It takes 72.8% of the time to do the adaptation, despite only lexical weights of the used rules are adapted. In contrast, our method has a speed of 10.2 words per second for each sentence on average, which is three times faster than the topic-specific lexicon translation method.","Meanwhile, we try to separate the effects of source-side topic distribution from the target-side topic distribution. From lines 4-6 of Table 2. We clearly find that the two rule-topic distributions improve the performance by 0.48 and 0.38 BLEU points over the baseline respectively. It seems that the source-side topic model is more helpful. Furthermore, when combine these two distributions, the improvement is increased to 0.64 points. This indicates that the effects of source-side and target-side distributions are complementary. 6.3 Effect of Topic Sensitivity Model As described in Section 3.2, because the similarity features always punish topic-insensitive rules, we introduce topic sensitivity features as a complement. In the last line of Table 2, we obtain a further improvement of 0.23 points, when incorporating topic sensitivity features with topic similarity features. This suggests that it is necessary to distinguish topic-insensitive and topic-sensitive rules.","6.4 One-to-One Vs. One-to-Many Topic Projection In Section 4.2, we find that source-side topic and target-side topics may not exactly match, hence we use one-to-many topic correspondence. Yet another method is to enforce one-to-one topic projection (Tam et al., 2007). We achieve one-to-one projection by aligning a target topic to the source topic with the largest correspondence probability as calculated in Section 4.2.","Table 4 compares the effects of these two method-756","System MT06 MT08 Avg Baseline 30.20 21.93 26.07 Phrase-rule 30.53 22.29 26.41","Monotone-rule 30.72 22.62 26.67","Reordering-rule 30.31 22.40 26.36","All-rule 30.95 22.92 26.94 Table 5: Effect of our topic model on three types of rules.

We find that the enforced one-to-one topic method obtains a slight improvement over the baseline system, while one-to-many projection achieves a larger improvement. This confirms our observation of the non-one-to-one mapping between source-side and target-side topics. 6.5 Effect on Various Types of Rules To get a more detailed analysis of the result, we further compare the effect of our method on different types of rules. We divide the rules into three types: phrase rules, which only contain terminals and are the same as the phrase pairs in phrase-based system; monotone rules, which contain nonterminals and produce monotone translations; reordering rules, which also contain non-terminals but change the order of translations. We define the monotone and reordering rules according to Chiang et al., (2008).","Table 5 show the results. We can see that our method achieves improvements on all the three types of rules. Our topic similarity method on monotone rule achieves the most improvement which is 0.6 BLEU points, while the improvement on reordering rules is the smallest among the three types. This shows that topic information also helps the selec-tions of rules with non-terminals."]},{"title":"7 Related Work","paragraphs":["In addition to the topic-specific lexicon translation method mentioned in the previous sections, researchers also explore topic model for machine translation in other ways.","Foster and Kunh (2007) describe a mixture-model approach for SMT adaptation.
