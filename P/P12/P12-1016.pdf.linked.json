English is a weakly inflected language: it has a narrow verbal paradigm, restricted nominal inflection (plurals), and only the vestiges of a case system. Consequently, translation into English—which accounts for much of the machine translation (MT) literature (Lopez, 2008)—often in-volves some amount of morpho-syntactic dimensionality reduction. Less attention has been paid to what happens during translation from English: richer grammatical features such as gender, dual number, and overt case are effectively latent variables that must be inferred during decoding.

This paper addresses the problem of generating text that conforms to morpho-syntactic agreement rules.","Agreement relations that cross statistical phrase boundaries are not explicitly modeled in most phrase-based MT systems (Avramidis and Koehn, 2008). We address this shortcoming with an agreement model that scores sequences of fine-grained morpho-syntactic classes. First, bound morphemes in translation hypotheses are segmented. Next, the segments are labeled with classes that encode both syntactic category information (i.e., parts of speech) and grammatical features such as number and gender. Finally, agreement is promoted by scoring the predicted class sequences with a generative Markov model.","Our model scores hypotheses during decoding. Unlike previous models for scoring syntactic relations, our model does not require bitext annotations, phrase table features, or decoder modifications. The model can be implemented using the feature APIs of popular phrase-based decoders such as Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) and Phrasal (Cer et al., 2010).","Intuition might suggest that the standard n-gram language model (LM) is sufficient to handle agreement phenomena. However, LM statistics are sparse, and they are made sparser by morphological varia-tion. For English-to-Arabic translation, we achieve a +1.04 BLEU average improvement by tiling our model on top of a large LM. 146","It has also been suggested that this setting requires morphological generation because the bitext may not contain all inflected variants (Minkov et al., 2007; Toutanova et al., 2008; Fraser et al., 2012). However, using lexical coverage experiments, we show that there is ample room for translation quality improvements through better selection of forms that already exist in the translation model."]},{"title":"2 A Class-based Model of Agreement 2.1 Morpho-syntactic Agreement","paragraphs":["Morpho-syntactic agreement refers to a relationship between two sentence elements a and b that must have at least one matching grammatical feature.1 Agreement relations tend to be defined for particular syntactic configurations such as verb-subject, noun-adjective, and pronoun-antecedent.

When this nominal appears in the subject argument position, the verb-subject agreement relationship triggers feminine inflection of the verb.","Our model treats agreement as a sequence of scored, pairwise relations between adjacent words. Of course, this assumption excludes some agreement phenomena, but it is sufficient for many common cases. We focus on English-Arabic translation as an example of a translation direction that expresses substantially more morphological information in the target. These relations are best captured in a target-side model because they are mostly unobserved (from lexical clues) in the English source.","The agreement model scores sequences of morpho-syntactic word classes, which express grammatical features relevant to agreement. The model has three components: a segmenter, a tagger, and a scorer. 2.2 Morphological Segmentation Segmentation is a procedure for converting raw surface forms to component morphemes. In some languages, agreement relations exist between bound morphemes, which are syntactically independent yet phonologically dependent morphemes. For example,","1","We use morpho-syntactic and grammatical agreement interchangeably, as is common in the literature.

This token has four segments with conflicting grammatical features. For example, the number feature is singular for the pronominal object and plural for the verb. Our model segments the raw token, tags each segment with a morpho-syntactic class (e.g., “Pron+Fem+Sg”), and then scores the class sequences. the single raw token in Fig. 2 contains at least four grammatically independent morphemes. Because the morphemes bear conflicting grammatical features and basic parts of speech (POS), we need to segment the token before we can evaluate agreement relations.2","Segmentation is typically applied as a bitext preprocessing step, and there is a rich literature on the effect of different segmentation schemata on translation quality (Koehn and Knight, 2003; Habash and Sadat, 2006; El Kholy and Habash, 2012). Unlike previous work, we segment each translation hypothesis as it is generated (i.e., during decoding). This permits greater modeling flexibility. For example, it may be useful to count tokens with bound morphemes as a unit during phrase extraction, but to score segmented morphemes separately for agreement.","We treat segmentation as a character-level sequence modeling problem and train a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF) model (Lafferty et al., 2001). As a pre-processing step, we group contiguous non-native characters (e.g., Latin characters in Arabic text).

It can be learned from gold-segmented data, generally applies to languages with bound morphemes, and does not require a handcompiled lexicon.3","Moreover, it has only four labels, so Viterbi decoding is very fast. We learn the parameters θseg using a quasi-Newton (QN) procedure with l1 (lasso) regularization (Andrew and Gao, 2007). 2.3 Morpho-syntactic Tagging After segmentation, we tag each segment with a fine-grained morpho-syntactic class. For this task we also train a standard CRF model on full sentences with gold classes and segmentation. We use the same QN procedure as before to obtain θtag.","A translation derivation is a tuple ⟨e, f, a⟩ where e is the target, f is the source, and a is an alignment between the two.

Set of Classes The tagger assigns morpho-syntactic classes, which are coarse POS categories refined with grammatical features such as gender and definiteness. The coarse categories are the universal POS tag set described by Petrov et al. (2012). More than 25 treebanks (in 22 languages) can be automatically mapped to this tag set, which includes “Noun” (nominals), “Verb” (verbs), “Adj” (adjectives), and “ADP” (pre-and post-positions). Many of these treebanks also contain per-token morphological annotations. It is easy to combine the coarse categories with selected grammatical annotations.","For Arabic, we used the coarse POS tags plus definiteness and the so-called phi features (gender, number, and person).4","For example,"]},{"title":"ŁPAJ@̧","paragraphs":["‘the car’ would be tagged “Noun+Def+Sg+Fem”. We restricted the set of classes to observed combinations in the training data, so the model implicitly disallows incoherent classes like “Verb+Def”. Features The tagging CRF includes emission features φo that indicate a class τi appearing with various orthographic characteristics of the word sequence being tagged. In typical CRF inference, the entire observation sequence is available throughout inference, so these features can be scored on observed words in an arbitrary neighborhood around the current position i. However, we conduct CRF inference in tandem with the translation decoding procedure (§3), creating an environment in which subsequent words of the observation are not available; the MT system has yet to generate the rest of the translation when the tagging features for a position are scored. Therefore, we only define emission features on the observed words at the current and previous positions of a class: φo(τi, ei, ei−1).","The emission features are word types, prefixes and suffixes of up to three characters, and indicators for digits and punctuation. None of these features are language specific.","Bigram transition features φt encode local agreement relations.

That is, the sample space is over class—not word—sequences. However, in MT, we seek a measure of sentence quality q(e) that is comparable across different hypotheses on the beam (much like the n-gram language model score). Discriminative model scores have been used as MT features (Galley and Manning, 2009), but we obtained better results by scoring the 1-best class sequences with a generative model. We trained a simple add-1 smoothed bigram language model over gold class sequences in the same treebank training data: q(e) = p(τ ) = I ∏ i=1 p(τi|τi−1)","We chose a bigram model due to the aggressive recombination strategy in our phrase-based decoder. For contexts in which the LM is guaranteed to back off (for instance, after an unseen bigram), our decoder maintains only the minimal state needed (perhaps only a single word). In less restrictive decoders, higher order scoring models could be used to score longerdistance agreement relations.","We integrate the segmentation, tagging, and scoring models into a self-contained component in the translation decoder."]},{"title":"3 Inference during Translation Decoding","paragraphs":["Scoring the agreement model as part of translation decoding requires a novel inference procedure. Crucially, the inference procedure does not measurably affect total MT decoding time. 3.1 Phrase-based Translation Decoding We consider the standard phrase-based approach to MT (Och and Ney, 2004).

(1). Specifically, when Extend generates a new hypothesis, we run the algorithm shown in Fig. 5. The inputs are a translation hypothesis eI","1, an index n distinguishing the prefix from the attachment, and a flag indicating if their concatenation is a goal hypothesis.","The beam search maintains state for each derivation, the score of which is a linear combination of the feature values. States in this program depend on some amount of lexical history. With a trigram language model, the state might be the last two words of the translation prefix. Recombine can be applied to any two hypotheses with equivalent states. As a 149 result, two hypotheses with different full prefixes— and thus potentially different sequences of agreement relations—can be recombined. Incremental Greedy Decoding Decoding with the CRF-based tagger model in this setting requires some slight modifications to the Viterbi algorithm. We make a greedy approximation that permits recombination and works well in practice. The agreement model state is the last tagged segment ⟨s, t⟩ of the concatenated hypothesis. We tag a new attachment by assuming a prior distribution π over the starting position such that π(t) = 0 and −∞ for all other classes, a deterministic distribution in the tropical semiring. This forces the Viterbi path to go through t. We only tag the final boundary symbol for goal hypotheses.","To accelerate tagger decoding in our experiments, we also used tagging dictionaries for frequently observed word types. For each word type observed more than 100 times in the training data, we restricted the set of possible classes to the set of observed classes. 3.3 Translation Model Features The agreement model score is one decoder feature function. The output of the procedure in Fig. 5 is the log probability of the class sequence of each attachment. Summed over all attachments, this gives the log probability of the whole class sequence.","We also add a new length penalty feature.

Unification-based Formalisms Agreement rules impose syntactic and semantic constraints on the structure of sentences. A principled way to model these constraints is with a unification-based grammar (UBG). Johnson (2003) presented algorithms for learning and parsing with stochastic UBGs. However, training data for these formalisms remains extremely limited, and it is unclear how to learn such knowledgerich representations from unlabeled data. One partial solution is to manually extract unification rules from phrase-structure trees. Williams and Koehn (2011) annotated German trees, and extracted translation rules from them. They then specified manual unification rules, and applied a penalty according to the number of unification failures in a hypothesis. In contrast, our class-based model does not require any manual rules and scores similar agreement phenomena as probabilistic sequences. Factored Translation Models Factored translation models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) facilitate a more data-oriented approach to agreement modeling. Words are represented as a vector of features such as lemma and POS. The bitext is annotated with separate models, and the annotations are saved during phrase extraction. Hassan et al. (2007) noticed that the target-side POS sequences could be scored, much as we do in this work. They used a target-side LM over Combinatorial Categorial Grammar (CCG) supertags, along with a penalty for the number of operator violations, and also modified the phrase probabilities based on the tags. However, Birch et al. (2007) showed that this approach captures the same re-ordering phenomena as lexicalized re-ordering models, which were not included in the baseline. Birch et al. (2007) then investigated source-side CCG supertag features, but did not show an improvement for Dutch-English.","Subotin (2011) recently extended factored translation models to hierarchical phrase-based translation and developed a discriminative model for predicting target-side morphology in English-Czech. His model benefited from gold morphological annotations on the target-side of the 8M sentence bitext.","In contrast to these methods, our model does not affect phrase extraction and does not require annotated translation rules. Class-based LMs Class-based LMs (Brown et al., 1992) reduce lexical sparsity by placing words in equivalence classes. They have been widely used for speech recognition, but not for MT. Och (1999) showed a method for inducing bilingual word classes that placed each phrase pair into a two-dimensional equivalence class. To our knowledge, Uszkoreit and Brants (2008) are the only recent authors to show an improvement in a state-of-the-art MT system using class-based LMs. They used a classical exchange algorithm for clustering, and learned 512 classes from 150 a large monolingual corpus. Then they mixed the classes into a word-based LM. However, both Och (1999) and Uszkoreit and Brants (2008) relied on automatically induced classes. It is unclear if their classes captured agreement information.","Monz (2011) recently investigated parameter estimation for POS-based language models, but his classes did not include inflectional features. Target-Side Syntactic LMs Our agreement model is a form of syntactic LM, of which there is a long history of research, especially in speech processing.5 Syntactic LMs have traditionally been too slow for scoring during MT decoding. One exception was the quadratic-time dependency language model presented by Galley and Manning (2009). They applied a quadratic time dependency parser to every hypothesis during decoding. However, to achieve quadratic running time, they permitted ill-formed trees (e.g., parses with multiple roots). More recently, Schwartz et al. (2011) integrated a right-corner, incremental parser into Moses. They showed a large improvement for Urdu-English, but decoding slowed by three orders of magnitude.6","In contrast, our class-based model encodes shallow syntactic information without a noticeable effect on decoding time.","Our model can be viewed as a way to score local syntactic relations without extensive decoder modifications. For long-distance relations, Shen et al. (2010) proposed a new decoder that generates target-side dependency trees.

Phrase Table Coverage In a standard phrase-based system, effective translation into a highly inflected target language requires that the phrase table contain the inflected word forms necessary to construct an output with correct agreement. If the requisite words are not present in the search space of the decoder, then no feature function would be sufficient to enforce morpho-syntactic agreement.","During development, we observed that the phrase table of our large-scale English-Arabic system did often contain the inflected forms that we desired the system to select.
