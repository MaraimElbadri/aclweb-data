We present an unsupervised model that simultaneously segments the speech, discovers a proper set of sub-word units (e.g., phones) and learns a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for each induced acoustic unit. Our approach is formulated as a Dirichlet process mixture model in which each mixture is an HMM that represents a sub-word unit. We apply our model to the TIMIT corpus, and the results demonstrate that our model discovers sub-word units that are highly correlated with English phones and also produces better segmentation than the state-of-the-art unsupervised baseline. We test the quality of the learned acoustic models on a spoken term detection task. Compared to the baselines, our model improves the relative precision of top hits by at least 22.1% and outperforms a language-mismatched acoustic model."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Acoustic models are an indispensable component of speech recognizers. However, the standard process of training acoustic models is expensive, and requires not only language-specific knowledge, e.g., the phone set of the language, a pronunciation dictionary, but also a large amount of transcribed data. Unfortunately, these necessary data are only available for a very small number of languages in the world. Therefore, a procedure for training acoustic models without annotated data would not only be a breakthrough from the traditional approach, but would also allow us to build speech recognizers for any language efficiently.","In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised acoustic modeling with only spoken utterances as training data. As suggested in Garcia and Gish (2006), unsupervised acoustic modeling can be broken down to three sub-tasks: segmentation, clustering segments, and modeling the sound pattern of each cluster. In previous work, the three sub-problems were often approached sequentially and independently in which initial steps are not related to later ones (Lee et al., 1988; Garcia and Gish, 2006; Chan and Lee, 2011). For example, the speech data was usually segmented regardless of the clustering results and the learned acoustic models.","In contrast to the previous methods, we approach the problem by modeling the three sub-problems as well as the unknown set of sub-word units as latent variables in one nonparametric Bayesian model. More specifically, we formulate a Dirichlet process mixture model where each mixture is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) used to model a sub-word unit and to generate observed segments of that unit. Our model seeks the set of sub-word units, segmentation, clustering and HMMs that best represent the observed data through an iterative inference process. We implement the inference process using Gibbs sampling.","We test the effectiveness of our model on the TIMIT database (Garofolo et al., 1993). Our model shows its ability to discover sub-word units that are highly correlated with standard English phones and to capture acoustic context information. For the segmentation task, our model outperforms the state-of-40 the-art unsupervised method and improves the relative F-score by 18.8 points (Dusan and Rabiner, 2006). Finally, we test the quality of the learned acoustic models through a keyword spotting task. Compared to the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods (Zhang and Glass, 2009; Zhang et al., 2012), our model yields a relative improvement in precision of top hits by at least 22.1% with only some degradation in equal error rate (EER), and outperforms a language-mismatched acoustic model trained with supervised data."]},{"title":"2 Related Work Unsupervised Sub-word Modeling","paragraphs":["We follow the general guideline used in (Lee et al., 1988; Garcia and Gish, 2006; Chan and Lee, 2011) and approach the problem of unsupervised acoustic modeling by solving three sub-problems of the task: segmentation, clustering and modeling each cluster. The key difference, however, is that our model does not assume independence among the three aspects of the problem, which allows our model to refine its solution to one sub-problem by exploiting what it has learned about other parts of the problem. Second, unlike (Lee et al., 1988; Garcia and Gish, 2006) in which the number of sub-word units to be learned is assumed to be known, our model learns the proper size from the training data directly.","Instead of segmenting utterances, the authors of (Varadarajan et al., 2008) trained a single state HMM using all data at first, and then iteratively split the HMM states based on objective functions. This method achieved high performance in a phone recognition task using a label-to-phone transducer trained from some transcriptions. However, the performance seemed to rely on the quality of the transducer. For our work, we assume no transcriptions are available and measure the quality of the learned acoustic units via a spoken query detection task as in Jansen and Church (2011).","Jansen and Church (2011) approached the task of unsupervised acoustic modeling by first discovering repetitive patterns in the data, and then learned a whole-word HMM for each found pattern, where the state number of each HMM depends on the average length of the pattern. The states of the whole-word HMMs were then collapsed and used to represent acoustic units. Instead of discovering repetitive patterns first, our model is able to learn from any given data. Unsupervised Speech Segmentation One goal of our model is to segment speech data into small sub-word (e.g., phone) segments. Most unsupervised speech segmentation methods rely on acoustic change for hypothesizing phone boundaries (Scharenborg et al., 2010; Qiao et al., 2008; Dusan and Rabiner, 2006; Estevan et al., 2007). Even though the overall approaches differ, these algorithms are all one-stage and bottom-up segmentation methods (Scharenborg et al., 2010). Our model does not make a single one-stage decision; instead, it infers the segmentation through an iterative process and exploits the learned sub-word models to guide its hypotheses on phone boundaries. Bayesian Model for Segmentation Our model is inspired by previous applications of nonparametric Bayesian models to segmentation problems in NLP and speaker diarization (Goldwater, 2009; Fox et al., 2011); particularly, we adapt the inference method used in (Goldwater, 2009) to our segmentation task. Our problem is, in principle, similar to the word segmentation problem discussed in (Goldwater, 2009). The main difference, however, is that our model is under the continuous real value domain, and the problem of (Goldwater, 2009) is under the discrete symbolic domain. For the domain our problem is applied to, our model has to include more latent variables and is more complex."]},{"title":"3 Problem Formulation","paragraphs":["The goal of our model, given a set of spoken utterances, is to jointly learn the following:","• Segmentation: To find the phonetic boundaries within each utterance.","• Nonparametric clustering: To find a proper set of clusters and group acoustically similar segments into the same cluster.","• Sub-word modeling: To learn a HMM to model each sub-word acoustic unit.","We model the three sub-tasks as latent variables in our approach.

Speech Feature (xi","t) The only observed data for our problem are a set of spoken utterances, which are converted to a series of 25 ms 13-dimensional Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) (Davis and Mermelstein, 1980) and their first- and second-order time derivatives at a 10 ms analysis rate. We use xi","t ∈ R39","to denote the tth","feature frame of the ith","utterance. Fig. 1 illustrates how the speech signal of a single word utterance banana is converted to a sequence of feature vectors xi","1 to xi","11.","Boundary (bi t) We use a binary variable bi","t to in-","dicate whether a phone boundary exists between xi","t and xi","t+1. If our model hypothesizes xi","t to be the last frame of a sub-word unit, which is called a boundary frame in this paper, bi","t is assigned with value 1; or 0 otherwise. Fig. 1 shows an example of the boundary variables where the values correspond to the true an-swers. We use an auxiliary variable gi","q to denote the index of the qth","boundary frame in utterance i. To make the derivation of posterior distributions easier in Section 5, we define gi","0 to be the beginning of an utterance, and Li to be the number of boundary frames in an utterance. For the example shown in Fig. 1, Li is equal to 6. Segment (pi","j,k) We define a segment to be composed of feature vectors between two boundary frames.

HMM (θc) In our model, each HMM has three emission states, which correspond to the beginning, middle and end of a sub-word unit (Jelinek, 1976). A traversal of each HMM must start from the first state, and only left-to-right transitions are allowed even though we allow skipping of the middle and the last state for segments shorter than three frames. The emission probability of each state is modeled by a diagonal Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with 8 mixtures. We use θc to represent the set of parameters that define the cth","HMM, which includes state transition probability a j,k c , and the GMM parameters","of each state emission probability.

Hidden State (si","t) Since we assume the observed data are generated by HMMs, each feature vector, xi t, has an associated hidden state index. We denote the hidden state of xi","t as si","t.

Specifically, we use a Bernoulli distribution as the prior of the boundary variables and impose a Dirichlet process prior on the cluster labels and the HMM parameters. The dotted arrows represent deterministic relations.

To apply Gibbs sampling to our problem, we need to derive the conditional posterior distributions of each hidden variable of the model.

Boundary Variable (bt) To derive the conditional posterior probability for bt, we introduce two variables:","l = (arg max gq gq < t) + 1","r = arg min gq t < gq where l is the index of the closest turned-on boundary variable that precedes bt plus 1, while r is the index of the closest turned-on boundary variable that follows bt. Note that because g0 and gL are defined, l and r always exist for any bt.","Note that the value of bt only affects segmentation between xl and xr. If bt is turned on, the sampler hypothesizes two segments pl,t and pt+1,r between xl and xr. Otherwise, only one segment pl,r is hypothesized. Since the segmentation on the rest of the data remains the same no matter what value bt takes, the conditional posterior probability of bt is:","P (bt = 1| · · · ) ∝ P (pl,t, pt+1,r|c− , θ) (6)","P (bt = 0| · · · ) ∝ P (pl,r|c− , θ) (7) where we assume that the prior probabilities for bt = 1 and bt = 0 are equal; c−","is the set of cluster labels of all segments except those between xl and xr ; and θ indicates the set of HMMs that have associated segments.

To handle the integral in Fig. 3, we sample one HMM from the prior and compute the likelihood using the new HMM to approximate the integral as suggested in (Rasmussen, 2000; Neal, 2000). 5.2 Heuristic Boundary Elimination To reduce the inference load on the boundary variables bt, we exploit acoustic cues in the feature space to eliminate bt’s that are unlikely to be phonetic boundaries. We follow the pre-segmentation method described in Glass (2003) to achieve the goal. For the rest of the boundary variables that are proposed by the heuristic algorithm, we randomly initialize their values and proceed with the sampling process described above."]},{"title":"6 Experimental Setup","paragraphs":["To the best of our knowledge, there are no standard corpora for evaluating unsupervised methods for acoustic modeling. However, numerous related studies have reported performance on the TIMIT corpus (Dusan and Rabiner, 2006; Estevan et al., 2007; Qiao et al., 2008; Zhang and Glass, 2009; Zhang et al., 2012), which creates a set of strong baselines for us to compare against. Therefore, the TIMIT corpus is chosen as the evaluation set for our model. In this section, we describe the methods used to measure the performance of our model on the following three tasks: sub-word acoustic modeling, segmentation and nonparametric clustering. Unsupervised Segmentation We compare the phonetic boundaries proposed by our model to the manual labels provided in the TIMIT dataset. We follow the suggestion of (Scharenborg et al., 2010) and use a 20-ms tolerance window to compute recall, precision rates and F-score of the segmentation our model proposed for TIMIT’s training set. We compare our model against the state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised segmentation methods that were also evaluated on the TIMIT training set (Dusan and Rabiner, 2006; Qiao et al., 2008). Nonparametric Clustering Our model automatically groups speech segments into different clusters. One question we are interested in answering is whether these learned clusters correlate to English phones. To answer the question, we develop a method to map cluster labels to the phone set in a dataset. We align each cluster label in an utterance to the phone(s) it overlaps with in time by using the boundaries proposed by our model and the manually-labeled ones. When a cluster label overlaps with more than one phone, we align it to the phone with the largest overlap.4","We compile the alignment results for 3696 training utterances5","and present a confusion matrix between the learned cluster labels and the 48 phonetic units used in TIMIT (Lee and Hon, 1989). Sub-word Acoustic Modeling Finally, and most importantly, we need to gauge the quality of the learned sub-word acoustic models. In previous work, Varadarajan et al. (2008) and Garcia and Gish (2006) tested their models on a phone recognition task and a term detection task respectively. These two tasks are fair measuring methods, but performance on these tasks depends not only on the learned acoustic models, but also other components such as the label-to-phone transducer in (Varadarajan et al., 2008) and the graphone model in (Garcia and Gish, 2006). To reduce performance dependencies on components other than the acoustic model, we turn to the task of spoken term detection, which is also the measuring method used in (Jansen and Church, 2011).","We compare our unsupervised acoustic model with three supervised ones: 1) an English triphone model, 2) an English monophone model and 3) a Thai monophone model. The first two were trained on TIMIT, while the Thai monophone model was trained with 32 hour clean read Thai speech from the LOTUS corpus (Kasuriya et al., 2003). All of the three models, as well as ours, used three-state HMMs to model phonetic units. To conduct spoken term detection experiments on the TIMIT dataset, we computed a posteriorgram representation for both training and test feature frames over the 4 Except when a cluster label is mapped to /vcl/ /b/, /vcl/ /g/","and /vcl/ /d/, where the duration of the release /b/, /g/, /d/ is","almost always shorter than the closure /vcl/.

Zhang and Glass (2009) trained a GMM with 50 components to decode posteriorgrams for the feature frames, and Zhang et al. (2012) used a deep Boltzmann machine (DBM) trained with pseudo phone labels generated from an unsupervised GMM to produce a posteriorgram representation. The evaluation metrics they used were: 1) P@N, the average precision of the top N hits, where N is the number of occurrences of each keyword in the test set; 2) EER: the average equal error rate at which the false acceptance rate is equal to the false rejection rate. We also report experimental results using the P@N and EER metrics.

The average co-occurrence frequency of the mapping pairs in this figure is 431. correlation between the cluster labels and individual English phones. For example, clusters 19, 20 and 21 are mapped exclusively to the vowel /ae/. A more careful examination on the alignment results shows that the three clusters are mapped to the same vowel in a different acoustic context. For example, cluster 19 is mapped to /ae/ followed by stop consonants, while cluster 20 corresponds to /ae/ followed by nasal consonants. This context-dependent relationship is also observed in other English phones and their corresponding sets of clusters. Fig. 4 also shows that a cluster may be mapped to multiple English phones. For instance, clusters 85 and 89 are mapped to more than one phone; nevertheless, a closer look reveals that these clusters are mapped to /n/, /d/ and /b/, which are sounds with a similar place of articulation (i.e. labial and dental). These correlations indicate that our model is able to discover the phonetic composition of a set of speech data without any language-specific knowledge.","The performance of the four acoustic models on the spoken term detection task is presented in Table 2. The English triphone model achieves the best P@N and EER results and performs slightly better than the English monophone model, which indicates a correlation between the quality of an acoustic model and its performance on the spoken term detection task. Although our unsupervised model does not perform as well as the supervised English 47 unit(%) P@N EER English triphone 75.9 11.7 English monophone 74.0 11.8 Thai monophone 56.6 14.9 Our model 63.0 16.9 Table 2: The performance of our model and three supervised acoustic models on the spoken term detection task. acoustic models, it generates a comparable EER and a more accurate detection performance for top hits than the Thai monophone model. This indicates that even without supervision, our model captures and learns the acoustic characteristics of a language automatically and is able to produce an acoustic model that outperforms a language-mismatched acoustic model trained with high supervision.","Table 3 shows that our model improves P@N by a large margin and generates only a slightly worse EER than the GMM baseline on the spoken term detection task. At the end of the training process, our model induced 169 HMMs, which were used to compute posteriorgrams. This seems unfair at first glance because Zhang and Glass (2009) only used 50 Gaussians for decoding, and the better result of our model could be a natural outcome of the higher complexity of our model. However, Zhang and Glass (2009) pointed out that using more Gaussian mixtures for their model did not improve their model performance. This indicates that the key reason for the improvement is our joint modeling method in-stead of simply the higher complexity of our model.","Compared to the DBM baseline, our model produces a higher EER; however, it improves the relative detection precision of top hits by 24.3%. As indicated in (Zhang et al., 2012), the hierarchical structure of DBM allows the model to provide a descent posterior representation of phonetic units. Even though our model only contains simple HMMs and Gaussians, it still achieves a comparable, if not better, performance as the DBM baseline. This demonstrates that even with just a simple model structure, the proposed learning algorithm is able to acquire rich phonetic knowledge from data and generate a fine posterior representation for phonetic units.","Table 4 summarizes the segmentation performance of the baselines, our model and the heuristic unit(%) P@N EER GMM (Zhang and Glass, 2009) 52.5 16.4 DBM (Zhang et al., 2012) 51.1 14.7 Our model 63.0 16.9 Table 3: The performance of our model and the GMM and DBM baselines on the spoken term detection task. unit(%) Recall Precision F-score Dusan (2006) 75.2 66.8 70.8 Qiao et al.

The language-independent pre-seg method is suitable for seeding our model. It eliminates most unlikely boundaries while retaining about 87% true boundaries. Even though this indicates that at best our model only recalls 87% of the true boundaries, the pre-seg reduces the search space significantly. In addition, it also allows the model to capture proper phone durations, which compensates the fact that we do not include any explicit duration modeling mechanisms in our approach. In the best semi-supervised baseline model (Qiao et al., 2008), the number of phone boundaries in an utterance was assumed to be known. Although our model does not incorporate this information, it still achieves a very close F-score. When compared to the baseline in which the number of phone boundaries in each utterance was also unknown (Dusan and Rabiner, 2006), our model outperforms in both recall and precision, improving the relative F-score by 18.8%. The key difference between the two baselines and our method is that our model does not treat segmentation as a stand-alone problem; instead, it jointly learns segmentation, clustering and acoustic units from data. The improvement on the segmentation task shown by our model further supports the strength of the joint learning scheme proposed in this paper."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We present a Bayesian unsupervised approach to the problem of acoustic modeling. Without any prior 48 knowledge, this method is able to discover phonetic units that are closely related to English phones, improve upon state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation method and generate more precise spoken term detection performance on the TIMIT dataset. In the future, we plan to explore phonological context and use more flexible topological structures to model acoustic units within our framework."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The authors would like to thank Hung-an Chang and Ekapol Chuangsuwanich for training the English and Thai acoustic models.
