This paper introduces a novel variant of the Yarowsky algorithm based on this view. It is a bootstrapping learning method which uses a graph propagation algorithm with a well defined objective function. The experimental results show that our proposed bootstrapping algorithm achieves state of the art performance or better on several different natural language data sets."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In this paper, we are concerned with a case of semi-supervised learning that is close to unsupervised learning, in that the labelled and unlabelled data points are from the same domain and only a small set of seed rules is used to derive the labelled points. We refer to this setting as bootstrapping. In contrast, typical semi-supervised learning deals with a large number of labelled points, and a domain adaptation task with unlabelled points from the new domain.","The two dominant discriminative learning methods for bootstrapping are self-training (Scudder, 1965) and co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998). In this paper we focus on a self-training style bootstrapping algorithm, the Yarowsky algorithm (Yarowsky, 1995). Variants of this algorithm have been formalized as optimizing an objective function in previous work by Abney (2004) and Haffari and Sarkar (2007), but it is not clear that any perform as well as the Yarowsky algorithm itself.","We take advantage of this formalization and introduce a novel algorithm called Yarowsky-prop which builds on the algorithms of Yarowsky (1995) and Subramanya et al. (2010). It is theoretically","∗","This research was partially supported by an NSERC, Canada (RGPIN: 264905) grant.

Note that Λ, V , etc. are relative to the current labelling Y . We additionally define F to be the set of all features, and use U to denote the uniform distribution. In the bootstrapping setting the learner is given an initial partial labelling Y (0)","where only a few examples are labelled (i.e. Y","(0)","x = ⊥ for most x).","Abney (2004) defines three probability distributions in his analysis of bootstrapping: θfj is the parameter for feature f with label j, taken to be normalized so that θf is a distribution over labels. φx is the labelling distribution representing the current Y ; it is a point distribution for labelled examples and uniform for unlabelled examples. πx is the prediction distribution over labels for example x.","The approach of Haghighi and Klein (2006b) and Haghighi and Klein (2006a) also uses a small set of 620 Algorithm 1: The basic Yarowsky algorithm.

We focus on discriminative training which does not require complex partition functions for normalization. Blum and Chawla (2001) introduce an early use of transductive learning using graph propagation. X. Zhu and Z. Ghahramani and J. Lafferty (2003)’s method of graph propagation is predominantly transductive, and the non-transductive version is closely related to Abney (2004) c.f. Haffari and Sarkar (2007).1"]},{"title":"3 Existing algorithms 3.1 Yarowsky","paragraphs":["A decision list (DL) is a (ordered) list of feature-label pairs (rules) which is produced by assigning a score to each rule and sorting on this score. It chooses a label for an example from the first rule whose feature is a feature of the example. For a DL the prediction distribution is defined by πx(j) ∝ maxf∈Fx θfj. The basic Yarowsky algorithm is shown in algorithm 1. Note that at any point some training examples may be left unlabelled by Y (t)",".","We use Collins and Singer (1999) for our exact specification of Yarowsky.2","It uses DL rule scores θfj ∝ |Λfj| + ε |Λf | + Lε (1) where ε is a smoothing constant. When constructing a DL it keeps only the rules with (pre-normalized) score over a threshold ζ. In our implementation we add the seed rules to each subsequent DL.3","1","Large-scale information extraction, e.g. (Hearst, 1992), Snowball (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000), AutoSlog (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997), and Junto (Talukdar, 2010) among others, also have similarities to our approach. We focus on the formal analysis of the Yarowsky algorithm by Abney (2004).","2","It is similar to that of Yarowsky (1995) but is better specified and omits word sense disambiguation optimizations. The general algorithm in Yarowsky (1995) is self-training with any kind of underlying supervised classifier, but we follow the convention of using Yarowsky to refer to the DL algorithm.","3","This is not clearly specified in Collins and Singer (1999), 3.2 Yarowsky-cautious Collins and Singer (1999) also introduce a variant algorithm Yarowsky-cautious. Here the DL training step keeps only the top n rules (f, j) over the threshold for each label j, ordered by |Λf |. Additionally the threshold ζ is checked against |Λfj|/|Λf | instead of the smoothed score. n begins at n0 and is incremented by ∆n at each iteration. We add the seed DL to the new DL after applying the cautious pruning. Cautiousness limits not only the size of the DL but also the number of labelled examples, prioritizing decisions which are believed to be of high accuracy.","At the final iteration Yarowsky-cautious uses the current labelling to train a DL without a threshold or cautiousness, and this DL is used for testing. We call this the retraining step.4 3.3 DL-CoTrain Collins and Singer (1999) also introduce the co-training algorithm DL-CoTrain. This algorithm alternates between two DLs using disjoint views of the features in the data. At each step it trains a DL and then produces a new labelling for the other DL. Each DL uses thresholding and cautiousness as we describe for Yarowsky-cautious. At the end the DLs are combined, the result is used to label the data, and a retraining step is done from this single labelling. 3.4 Y-1/DL-1-VS One of the variant algorithms of Abney (2004) is Y-1/DL-1-VS (referred to by Haffari and Sarkar (2007) as simply DL-1). Besides various changes in the specifics of how the labelling is produced, this algorithm has two differences versus Yarowsky. Firstly, the smoothing constant ε in (1) is replaced by 1/|Vf |. Secondly, π is redefined as πx(j) = 1 |Fx|","∑","f∈Fx θfj, which we refer to as the sum definition of π. This definition does not match a literal DL but is easier to analyze. We are not concerned here with the details of Y-1/DL-1-VS, but we note that Haffari and Sarkar but is used for DL-CoTrain in the same paper.","4","The details of Yarowsky-cautious are not clearly specified in Collins and Singer (1999). Based on similar parts of DL-CoTrain we assume the that the top n selection is per label rather in total, that the thresholding value is unsmoothed, and that there is a retraining step. We also assume their notation Count′","(x) to be equivalent to |Λf |. 621 (2007) provide an objective function for this algorithm using a generalized definition of cross-entropy in terms of Bregman distance, which motivates our objective in section 4. The Bregman distance between two discrete probability distributions p and q is defined as Bψ(p, q) =∑","i [ψ(pi) − ψ(qi) − ψ′","(q i)(pi − qi)]. As a specific case we have Bt2(p, q) = ∑ i(pi − qi)2","= ||p − q||2",".","Then Bregman distance-based entropy is Ht2(p) =","− ∑","i p2","i , KL-Divergence is Bt2, and cross-entropy","follows the standard definition in terms of Ht2 and","Bt2. The objective minimized by Y-1/DL-1-VS is: ∑ x∈X f∈Fx Ht2(φx||θf ) = ∑ x∈X f∈Fx [ Bt2(φx||θf ) − ∑ y φ2 x ] . (2) 3.5 Yarowsky-sum As a baseline for the sum definition of π, we introduce the Yarowsky-sum algorithm. It is the same as Yarowsky except that we use the sum definition when labelling: for example x we choose the label j with the highest (sum) πx(j), but set Yx = ⊥ if the sum is zero. Note that this is a linear model similar to a conditional random field (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) for unstructured multiclass problems. 3.6 Bipartite graph algorithms Haffari and Sarkar (2007) suggest a bipartite graph framework for semi-supervised learning based on their analysis of Y-1/DL-1-VS and objective (2). The graph has vertices X ∪ F and edges {(x, f ) : x ∈ X, f ∈ Fx}, as in the graph shown in figure 1(a). Each vertex represents a distribution over labels, and in this view Yarowsky can be seen as alternately updating the example distributions based on the feature distributions and visa versa.","Based on this they give algorithm 2, which we call HS-bipartite. It is parametrized by two functions which are called features-to-example and examples-to-feature here. Each can be one of two choices: average(S) is the normalized average of the distributions of S, while majority(S) is a uniform distribution if all labels are supported by equal numbers of distributions of S, and other-wise a point distribution with mass on the best supported label. The average-majority form is similar Algorithm 2: HS-bipartite. 1: apply θ(0)","to X produce a labelling Y (0) 2: for iteration t to maximum or convergence do 3: for f ∈ F do 4: let p = examples-to-feature({φx : x ∈ Xf }) 5: if p ̸= U then let θf = p 6: end for 7: for x ∈ X do 8: let p = features-to-example({θf : f ∈ Fx}) 9: if p ̸= U then let φx = p 10: end for 11: end for to Y-1/DL-1-VS, and the majority-majority form minimizes a different objective similar to (2).","In our implementation we label training data (for the convergence check) with the φ distributions from the graph. We label test data by constructing new φx = examples-to-feature(Fx) for the unseen x.","3.7 Semi-supervised learning algorithm of Subramanya et al. (2010) Subramanya et al. (2010) give a semi-supervised algorithm for part of speech tagging. Unlike the algorithms described above, it is for domain adaptation with large amounts of labelled data rather than bootstrapping with a small number of seeds.","This algorithm is structurally similar to Yarowsky in that it begins from an initial partial labelling and repeatedly trains a classifier on the labelling and then relabels the data. It uses a CRF (Lafferty et al., 2001) as the underlying supervised learner. It differs significantly from Yarowsky in two other ways: First, instead of only training a CRF it also uses a step of graph propagation between distributions over the n-grams in the data. Second, it does the propagation on distributions over n-gram types rather than over n-gram tokens (instances in the data).","They argue that using propagation over types allows the algorithm to enforce constraints and find similarities that self-training cannot. We are not concerned here with the details of this algorithm, but it motivates our work firstly in providing the graph propagation which we will describe in more detail in section 4, and secondly in providing an algorithmic structure that we use for our algorithm in section 5. 3.8 Collins and Singer (1999)’s EM We implemented the EM algorithm of Collins and Singer (1999) as a baseline for the other algorithms. 622 Method V N (u) qu φ-θ X ∪ F Nx = Fx, Nf = Xf qx = φx, qf = θf π-θ X ∪ F Nx = Fx, Nf = Xf qx = πx, qf = θf θ-only F Nf = ⋃ x∈Xf Fx \\ f qf = θf","θT -only F N f = ⋃","x∈Xf Fx \\ f qf = θT f Table 2: Graph structures for propagation.

(2010) is a method for smoothing distributions attached to vertices of a graph. Here we present it with an alternate notation using Bregman distances as described in section 3.4.5","The objective is μ ∑ u∈V v∈N (i) wuvBt2(qu, qv) + ν ∑ u∈V Bt2(qu, U ) (3) where V is a set of vertices, N (v) is the neighbourhood of vertex v, and qv is an initial distribution for each vertex v to be smoothed. They give an iterative update to minimize (3). Note that (3) is independent of their specific graph structure, distributions, and semi-supervised learning algorithm.","We propose four methods for using this propagation with Yarowsky. These methods all use constant edge weights (wuv = 1). The distributions and graph structures are shown in table 2. Figure 1 shows example graphs for φ-θ and θ-only. π-θ and θT","-only are similar, and are described below.","The graph structure of φ-θ is the bipartite graph of Haffari and Sarkar (2007).

Second, (3) sums over each edge twice (once in each direction), while (2) sums over each only once. Since wuv = wvu and Bt2(qu, qv) = Bt2(qv, qu), this can be folded into the constant μ. Third, after expanding (2) there is a term |Fx| inside the sum for Ht2(φx) which is not present in (3). This does not effect the direction of minimiza-tion. Fourth, Bt2(qu, U) in (3) expands to Ht2(qu) plus a constant, adding an extra constant term to the total.","θf| F | θf4 θf3 θf2 θf1 φx1 φx2 φx3 φx4","φx| X |","... ...

The π-θ method is like φ-θ except for using π as the distribution for example vertices.","The bipartite graph of the first two methods differs from the structure used by Subramanya et al. (2010) in that it does propagation between two different kinds of distributions instead of only one kind. We also adopt a more comparable approach with a graph over only features. Here we define adjacency by co-occurrence in the same example. The θ-only method uses this graph and θ as the distribution.","Finally, we noted in section 3.7 that the algorithm of Subramanya et al.

(2010). Initial experiments with different propagation parameters suggested that as long as ν was set at this value changing μ had relatively little effect on the accuracy. We did not find any propagation parameter settings that outperformed this choice. For the Yarowsky-prop algorithms we perform a single iteration of the propagation update for each iteration of the algorithm.","For EM we use weights λ1 = 0.98, and λ2 = 0.02 (see section 3.8), which were found in initial experiments to be the best values, and results are averaged over 10 random initializations.","The named entity test set contains some examples that are neither person, organization, nor location.

We also report (clean) non-seeded accuracy, which we define to be clean accuracy over only examples which are not assigned a label by the seed rules. This is intended to evaluate what the algorithm has learned, rather than what it can achieve by using the input information directly (Daume, 2011).","We test Yarowsky, Yarowsky-cautious, Yarowsky-sum, DL-CoTrain, HS-bipartite in all four forms, and Yarowsky-prop cautious and non-cautious and in all four forms.

The Yarowsky-prop non-cautious algorithms quickly converge to the final accuracy and are not shown. While the other algorithms (figure 4(a)) make a large accuracy improvement in the final retraining step, the Yarowsky-prop (figure 4(b)) algorithms reach comparable accuracies earlier and gain much less from retraining.","We did not implement Collins and Singer (1999)’s CoBoost; however, in their results it performs comparably to DL-CoTrain and Yarowsky-cautious. As with DL-CoTrain, CoBoost requires two views. 6.4 Cautiousness Cautiousness appears to be important in the performance of the algorithms we tested. In table 3, only the cautious algorithms are able to reach the 90% accuracy range.","To evaluate the effects of cautiousness we examine the Yarowsky-prop θ-only algorithm on the named entity task in more detail. This algorithm has two classifiers which are trained in conjunction: the DL and the propagated θP",". Figure 5 shows the training set coverage (of the labelling on line 6 of algorithm 3) and the test set accuracy of both classifiers, for the cautious and non-cautious versions.","The non-cautious version immediately learns a DL over all feature-label pairs, and therefore has full coverage after the first iteration. The DL and θP","converge to similar accuracies within a few more iterations, and the retraining step increases accuracy by less than one percent. On the other hand, the cautious version gradually increases the coverage over the iterations. The DL accuracy follows the coverage closely (similar to the behaviour of Yarowsky-cautious, not shown here), while the propagated classifier accuracy jumps quickly to near 90% and then increases only gradually.","Although the DL prior to retraining achieves a roughly similar accuracy in both versions, only the cautious version is able to reach the 90% accuracy range in the propagated classifier and retraining. Presumably the non-cautious version makes an early mistake, reaching a local minimum which it cannot escape. The cautious version avoids this by making only safe rule selection and labelling choices.","Figure 5(b) also helps to clarify the difference in retraining that we noted in section 6.3. Like the non-propagated DL algorithms, the DL component of Yarowsky-prop has much lower accuracy than the propagated classifier prior to the retraining step. But after retraining, the DL and θP","reach very similar accuracies. 626 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Non-seeded test accuracy Iteration DL-CoTrain (cautious)","Yarowsky Yarowsky-cautious Yarowsky-cautious sum (a) Collins & Singer algorithms (plus sum form) 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Non-seeded test accuracy Iteration Yarowsky-prop-cautious phi-theta Yarowsky-prop-cautious pi-theta Yarowsky-prop-cautious theta-only","Yarowsky-prop-cautious thetatype-only (b) Yarowsky propagation cautious Figure 4: Non-seeded test accuracy versus iteration for various algorithms on named entity.

Figure 6 shows the graph propagation objective (3) along with accuracy for Yarowsky-prop φ-θ without cautiousness. The objective value decreases as expected, and converges along with accuracy. Conversely, the cautious version (not shown here) does not clearly minimize the objective, since cautiousness limits the effect of the propagation."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions","paragraphs":["Our novel algorithm achieves accuracy comparable to Yarowsky-cautious, but is better theoretically motivated by combining ideas from Haffari and Sarkar (2007) and Subramanya et al.
