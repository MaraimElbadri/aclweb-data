Besides, this model is formal syntax-based and does not need to specify the syntactic constituents of subphrases, so it can directly learn synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) from a parallel text without relying on any linguistic annotations or as-sumptions, which makes it used conveniently and widely.","∗","This work was done when the first author visited Microsoft Research Asia as an intern.","However, it is often desirable to consider syntactic constituents of subphrases, e.g. the hierarchical phrase X → ⟨X 1 for X 2 , X 2 de X 1 ⟩ can be applied to both of the following strings in Figure 1","“A request for a purchase of shares” “filed for bankruptcy”, and get the following translation, respectively","“goumai gufen de shenqing” “pochan de shenqing”. In the former, “A request” is a NP and this rule acts correctly while in the latter “filed” is a VP and this rule gives a wrong reordering. If we specify the first X on the right-hand side to NP, this kind of errors can be avoided.","The tree-to-string model (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006) introduces linguistic syntax via source parse to direct word reordering, especially long-distance reordering. Furthermore, this model is for-malised as Tree Substitution Grammars, so it observes syntactic cohesion. Syntactic cohesion means that the translation of a string covered by a subtree in a source parse tends to be continuous. Fox (2002) shows that translation between English and French satisfies cohesion in the majority cases. Many previous works show promising results with an as-sumption that syntactic cohesion explains almost all translation movement for some language pairs (Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Eisner, 2003; Graehl and Knight, 2004; Quirk et al., 2005; Cherry, 2008; Feng et al., 2010). 950","But unfortunately, the tree-to-string model requires each node must be strictly matched during rule matching, which makes it strongly dependent on the relationship of tree nodes and their roles in the whole sentence. This will lead to data sparseness and being vulnerable to parse errors.","In this paper, we present a hierarchical chunk-to-string translation model to combine the merits of the two models. Instead of parse trees, our model introduces linguistic information in the form of chunks, so it does not need to care the internal structures and the roles in the main sentence of chunks. Based on shallow parsing results, it learns rules consisting of either words (terminals) or chunks (nonterminals), where adjacent chunks are packed into one nonterminal. It searches for the best derivation through the SCFG-motivated space defined by these rules and get target translation simultaneously. In some sense, our model can be seen as a compromise between the hierarchical phrase-based model and the tree-to-string model, specifically","• Compared with the hierarchical phrase-based model, it integrates linguistic syntax and satisfies syntactic cohesion.","• Compared with the tree-to-string model, it only needs to perform shallow parsing which introduces less parsing errors. Besides, our model allows a nonterminal in a rule to cover several chunks, which can alleviate data sparseness and the influence of parsing errors.","• we refine our hierarchical chunk-to-string model into two models: a loose model (Section 2.1) which is more similar to the hierarchical phrase-based model and a tight model (Section 2.2) which is more similar to the tree-to-string model.","The experiments show that on the 2008 NIST English-Chinese MT translation test set, both the loose model and the tight model outperform the hierarchical phrase-based model and the tree-to-string model, where the loose model has a better performance. While in terms of speed, the tight model runs faster and its speed ranking is between the tree-to-string model and the hierarchical phrase-based model.","NP IN NP IN NP VBD VP A request for a purchase of shares was made goumai gufen de shenqing bei dijiao 购买 股份 的 申请 被 递交","(a)","NP VBZ VBN IN NP The bank has filed for bankruptcy gai yinhang yijing shenqing pochan 该 银行 已经 申请 破产","(b) Figure 1: A running example of two sentences.

In Figure 1, we give the chunk sequence in the first row for each sentence. We treat shallow parsing as a sequence label task, and a sentence f can have many possible different chunk label sequences. Therefore, in theory, the conditional probability of a target translation e conditioned on the source sentence f is given by taking the chunk label sequences as a latent variable c: p(e|f ) = ∑ c p(c|f )p(e|f , c) (1) 951 In practice, we only take the best chunk label sequence ĉ got by","ĉ = argmax c p(c|f ) (2) Then we can ignore the conditional probability p(ĉ|f ) as it holds the same value for each translation, and get: p(e|f ) = p(ĉ|f )p(e|f , ĉ) = p(e|f , ĉ) (3)","We formalize our model as a weighted SCFG. In a SCFG, each rule (usually called production in SCFGs) has an aligned pair of right-hand sides — the source side and the target side, just as follows: X → ⟨α, β, ∼⟩ where X is a nonterminal, α and β are both strings of terminals and nonterminals, and ∼ denotes one-to-one links between nonterminal occurrences in α and nonterminal occurrences in β. A SCFG produces a derivation by starting with a pair of start symbols and recursively rewrites every two coindexed nonterminals with the corresponding components of a matched rule. A derivation yields a pair of strings on the right-hand side which are translation of each other.","In a weighted SCFG, each rule has a weight and the total weight of a derivation is the production of the weights of the rules used by the derivation. A translation may be produced by many different derivations and we only use the best derivation to evaluate its probability. With d denoting a derivation and r denoting a rule, we have","p(e|f ) = max d p(d, e|f , ĉ)","= max d ∏ r∈d p(r, e|f , ĉ) (4) Following Och and Ney (2002), we frame our model as a log-linear model: p(e|f ) = exp","∑ k λkHk(d, e, ĉ, f ) exp","∑","d′ ,e′ ,k λkHk(d′",", e′",", ĉ, f ) (5) where Hk(d, e, ĉ, f ) = ∑ r hk(f , ĉ, r) So the best translation is given by","ê = argmax e ∑ k λkHk(d, e, ĉ, f ) (6) We employ the same set of features for the log-linear model as the hierarchical phrase-based model does(Chiang, 2005).","We further refine our hierarchical chunk-to-string model into two models: a loose model which is more similar to the hierarchical phrase-based model and a tight model which is more similar to the tree-to-string model. The two models differ in the form of rules and the way of estimating rule probabilities. While for decoding, we employ the same decoding algorithm for the two models: given a test sentence, the decoders first perform shallow parsing to get the best chunk sequence, then apply a CYK parsing algorithm with beam search. 2.1 A Loose Model In our model, we employ rules containing nonterminals to handle long-distance reordering where boundary words play an important role. So for the subphrases which cover more than one chunk, we just maintain boundary chunks: we bundle adjacent chunks into one nonterminal and denote it as the first chunk tag immediately followed by “-” and next followed by the last chunk tag. Then, for the string pair <filed for bankruptcy, shenqing pochan>, we can get the rule r1 : X → ⟨VBN 1 for NP 2 , VBN 1 NP 2 ⟩ while for the string pair <A request for a purchase of shares, goumai gufen de shenqing>, we can get r2 : X → ⟨NP 1 for NP-NP 2 , NP-NP 2 de NP 1 ⟩. The rule matching “A request for a purchase of shares was” will be r3 : X → ⟨NP-NP 1 VBD 2 , NP-NP 1 VBD 2 ⟩. We can see that in contrast to the method of representing each chunk separately, this representation form can alleviate data sparseness and the influence of parsing errors. 952","⟨S 1 , S 1 ⟩ ⇒ ⟨S 2 X 3 , S 2 X 3 ⟩ ⇒ ⟨X 4 X 3 , X 4 X 3 ⟩ ⇒ ⟨NP-NP 5 VBD 6 X 3 , NP-NP 5 VBD 6 X 3 ⟩ ⇒ ⟨NP 7 for NP-NP 8 VBD 6 X 3 , NP-NP 8 de NP 7 VBD 6 X 3 ⟩ ⇒ ⟨A request for NP-NP 8 VBD 6 X 3 , NP-NP 8 de shenqing VBD 6 X 3 ⟩ ⇒ ⟨A request for a purchase of shares VBD 6 X 3 , goumai gufen de shenqing VBD 6 X 3 ⟩ ⇒ ⟨A request for a purchase of shares was X 3 , goumai gufen de shenqing bei X 3 ⟩ ⇒ ⟨A request for a purchase of shares was made, goumai gufen de shenqing bei dijiao⟩ (a) The loose model","⟨NP-VP 1 , NP-VP 1 ⟩ ⇒ ⟨NP-VBD 2 VP 3 , NP-VBD 2 VP 3 ⟩ ⇒ ⟨NP-NP 4 VBD 5 VP 3 , NP-NP 4 VBD 5 VP 3 ⟩ ⇒ ⟨NP 6 for NP-NP 7 VBD 5 VP 3 , NP-NP 7 de NP 6 VBD 5 VP 3 ⟩ ⇒ ⟨A request for NP-NP 7 VBD 5 VP 3 , NP-NP 7 de shenqing VBD 5 VP 3 ⟩ ⇒ ⟨A request for a purchase of shares VBD 5 VP 3 , goumai gufen de shenqing VBD 5 VP 3 ⟩ ⇒ ⟨A request for a purchase of shares was VP 3 , goumai gufen de shenqing bei VP 3 ⟩ ⇒ ⟨A request for a purchase of shares was made, goumai gufen de shenqing bei dijiao⟩ (b) The tight model Figure 3: The derivations of the sentence in Figure 1(a).","In these rules, the left-hand nonterminal symbol X can not match any nonterminal symbol on the right-hand side. So we need a set of rules such as NP → ⟨X 1 , X 1 ⟩ NP-NP → ⟨X 1 , X 1 ⟩ and so on, and set the probabilities of these rules to 1. To simplify the derivation, we discard this kind of rules and assume that X can match any nonterminal on the right-hand side.","Only with r2 and r3, we cannot produce any derivation of the whole sentence in Figure 1 (a). In this case we need two special glue rules: r4 : S → ⟨S 1 X 2 , S 1 X 2 ⟩ r5 : S → ⟨X 1 , X 1 ⟩ Together with the following four lexical rules, r6 : X → ⟨a request, shenqing⟩ r7 : X → ⟨a purchase of shares, goumai gufen⟩ r8 : X → ⟨was, bei⟩ r9 : X → ⟨made, dijiao⟩ Figure 3(a) shows the derivation of the sentence in Figure 1(a). 2.2 A Tight Model In the tight model, the right-hand side of each rule remains the same as the loose model, but the left-hand side nonterminal is not X but the corresponding chunk labels. If a rule covers more than one chunk, we just use the first and the last chunk labels to denote the left-hand side nonterminal. The rule set used in the tight model for the example in Figure 1(a) corresponding to that in the loose model becomes: r2 : NP-NP → ⟨NP 1 for NP-NP 2 , NP-NP 2 de NP 1 ⟩ r3 : NP-VBD → ⟨NP-NP 1 VBD 2 , NP-NP 1 VBD 2 ⟩. r6 : NP → ⟨a request, shenqing⟩ r7 : NP-NP → ⟨a purchase of shares, goumai gufen⟩ r8 : VBD → ⟨was, bei⟩ r9 : VP → ⟨made, dijiao⟩","During decoding, we first collect rules for each span. For a span which does not have any matching rule, if we do not construct default rules for it, there will be no derivation for the whole sentence, then we need to construct default rules for this kind of span by enumerating all possible binary segmentation of the chunks in this span. For the example in Figure 1(a), there is no rule matching the whole sentence, 953 so we need to construct default rules for it, which should be NP-VP → ⟨NP-VBD 1 VP 2 , NP-VBD 1 VP 2 ⟩. NP-VP → ⟨NP-NP 1 VBD-VP 2 , NP-NP 1 VBD-VP 2 ⟩. and so on.","Figure 3(b) shows the derivation of the sentence in Figure 1(a)."]},{"title":"3 Shallow Parsing","paragraphs":["In a parse tree, a chunk is defined by a leaf node or an inner node whose children are all leaf nodes (See Figure 2 (a)). In our model, we identify chunks by traversing a parse tree in a breadth-first order. Once a node is recognized as a chunk, we skip its children. In this way, we can get a sole chunk sequence given a parse tree. Then we label each word with a label indicating whether the word starts a chunk (B-) or continues a chunk (I-). Figure 2(a) gives an example. In this method, we get the training data for shallow parsing from Penn Tree Bank.","We take shallow Parsing (chunking) as a sequence label task and employ Conditional Random Field (CRF)1","to train a chunker. CRF is a good choice for label tasks as it can avoid label bias and use more statistical correlated features. We employ the features described in Sha and Pereira (2003) for CRF.

We learn rules from a corpus that first is bidirectionally word-aligned by the GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2000) and then is refined using a “final-and” strategy. We generate the rule set in two steps: first, we extract two sets of phrases, basic phrases and chunk-based phrases. Basic phrases are defined using the same heuristic as previous systems (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004; Chiang, 2005). A chunk-based phrase is such a basic phrase that covers one or more chunks on the source side.","1","We use the open source toolkit CRF++ got in http://code.google.com/p/crfpp/ .

In contrast, for the tight model, both the whole rule and the nonterminal are cohesive.","Even with the cohesion constraints, our model still generates a large number of rules, but not all 954 of the rules are useful for translation.

We set the same configuration for all the decoders as follows: stack size = 30, nbest size = 30. For the hierarchical chunk-based and phrase-based decoders, we set max rule length to 5.

From the results, we can see that both the loose and tight decoders outperform the baseline decoders and the improvement is significant using the sign-test of Collins et al. (2005) (p < 0.01). Specifically, the loose model has a better performance while the tight model has a faster speed.","Compared with the hierarchical phrase-based model, the loose model only imposes syntactic cohesion cohesion to nonterminals while the tight model imposes syntax cohesion to both rules and nonterminals which reduces search space, so it decoders faster. We can conclude that linguistic syntax can indeed improve the translation performance; syntactic cohesion for nonterminals can explain linguistic phenomena well; noncohesive rules are useful, too. The extra time consumption against hierarchical phrase-based system comes from shallow parsing.","By investigating the translation result, we find that our decoder does well in rule selection. For example, in the hierarchical phrase-based model, this kind of rules, such as X → ⟨X of X, ∗⟩, X → ⟨X for X, ∗⟩ and so on, where ∗ stands for the target component, are used with a loose restriction as long as the terminals are matched, while our models employ more stringent constraints on these rules by specifying the syntactic constituent of “X”.

The row cohesive represents the loose system where nonterminals satisfy cohesion, and the row noncohesive represents the modified version of the loose system where nonterminals can be noncohesive.","Compared with the tree-to-string model, the result indicates that the change of the source-side linguistic syntax from parses to chunks can improve translation performance. The reasons should be our model can reduce parse errors and it is enough to use chunks as the basic unit for machine translation. Although our decoders and tree-to-string decoder all run in linear-time with beam search, tree-to-string model runs faster for it searches through a smaller SCFG-motivated space. 6.4 Influence of Cohesion We verify the influence of syntax cohesion via the loose model. The cohesive model imposes syntax cohesion on nonterminals to ensure the chunk is reordered as a whole. In this experiment, we introduce a noncohesive model by allowing a nonterminal to match part of a chunk. For example, in the noncohesive model, it is legal for a rule with the source side “NP for NP-NP” to match “request for a purchase of shares” in Figure 1 (a), where “request” is part of NP. As well, the rule with the source side “NP for a NP-NP” can match “request for a purchase of shares”. In this way, we can ensure all the rules used in the cohesive system can be used in the noncohesive system. Besides cohesive rules, the noncohesive system can use noncohesive rules, too.","We give the results in Table 3.
