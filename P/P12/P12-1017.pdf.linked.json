We present a modification of the method shown in (Ravi and Knight, 2011) that is scalable to vocabulary sizes of several thousand words. On the task shown in (Ravi and Knight, 2011) we obtain better results with only 5% of the computational effort when running our method with an n-gram language model. The efficiency improvement of our method allows us to run experiments with vocabulary sizes of around 5,000 words, such as a non-parallel version of the VERBMOBIL corpus.

In these visions, even previously unknown languages can be learned automatically from analyzing foreign language input.","In this work, we attempt to learn statistical translation models from only monolingual data in the source and target language. The reasoning behind this idea is that the elements of languages share statistical similarities that can be automatically identified and matched with other languages.","This work is a big step towards large-scale and large-vocabulary unsupervised training of statistical translation models. Previous approaches have faced constraints in vocabulary or data size. We show how","∗","Author now at Google Inc., amauser@google.com. to scale unsupervised training to real-life translation tasks and how large-scale experiments can be done. Monolingual data is more readily available, if not abundant compared to true parallel or even just translated data. Learning from only monolingual data in real-life translation tasks could improve especially low resource language pairs where few or no parallel texts are available.","In addition to that, this approach offers the opportunity to decipher new or unknown languages and derive translations based solely on the available monolingual data. While we do tackle the full unsupervised learning task for MT, we make some very basic assumptions about the languages we are dealing with:","1. We have large amounts of data available in source and target language. This is not a very strong assumption as books and text on the in-ternet are readily available for almost all languages.","2. We can divide the given text in tokens and sentence-like units. This implies that we know enough about the language to tokenize and sentence-split a given text. Again, for the vast majority of languages, this is not a strong restriction.","3. The writing system is one-dimensional left-to-right. It has been shown (Lin and Knight, 2006) that the writing direction can be determined separately and therefore this assumption does not pose a real restriction.","Previous approaches to unsupervised training for SMT prove feasible only for vocabulary sizes up to around 500 words (Ravi and Knight, 2011) and data 156 sets of roughly 15,000 sentences containing only about 4 tokens per sentence on average. Real data as it occurs in texts such as web pages or news texts does not meet any of these characteristics.","In this work, we will develop, describe, and evaluate methods for large vocabulary unsupervised learning of machine translation models suitable for real-world tasks. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we will review the related work and describe how our approach extends existing work. Section 3 describes the model and training criterion used in this work. The implementation and the training of this model is then described in Section 5 and experimentally evaluated in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Unsupervised training of statistical translations systems without parallel data and related problems have been addressed before. In this section, we will review previous approaches and highlight similarities and differences to our work. Several steps have been made in this area, such as (Knight and Yamada, 1999), (Ravi and Knight, 2008), or (Snyder et al., 2010), to name just a few. The main difference of our work is, that it allows for much larger vocabulary sizes and more data to be used than previous work while at the same time not being dependent on seed lexica and/or any other knowledge of the languages.","Close to the methods described in this work, Ravi and Knight (2011) treat training and translation without parallel data as a deciphering problem. Their best performing approach uses an EM-Algorithm to train a generative word based translation model. They perform experiments on a Spanish/English task with vocabulary sizes of about 500 words and achieve a performance of around 20 BLEU compared to 70 BLEU obtained by a system that was trained on parallel data. Our work uses the same training criterion and is based on the same generative story. However, we use a new training procedure whose critical parts have constant time and memory complexity with respect to the vocabulary size so that our methods can scale to much larger vocabulary sizes while also being faster.","In a different approach, Koehn and Knight (2002) induce a bilingual lexicon from only non-parallel data. To achieve this they use a seed lexicon which they systematically extend by using orthographic as well as distributional features such as context, and frequency. They perform their experiments on non-parallel German-English news texts, and test their mappings against a bilingual lexicon. We use a greedy method similar to (Koehn and Knight, 2002) for extending a given lexicon, and we implicitly also use the frequency as a feature. However, we perform fully unsupervised training and do not start with a seed lexicon or use linguistic features.","Similarly, Haghighi et al. (2008) induce a one-to-one translation lexicon only from non-parallel monolingual data. Also starting with a seed lexicon, they use a generative model based on canonical correlation analysis to systematically extend the lexicon using context as well as spelling features. They evaluate their method on a variety of tasks, ranging from inherently parallel data (EUROPARL) to unrelated corpora (100k sentences of the GIGAWORD corpus). They report F-measure scores of the induced entries between 30 to 70. As mentioned above, our work neither uses a seed lexicon nor orthographic features."]},{"title":"3 Translation Model","paragraphs":["In this section, we describe the statistical training criterion and the translation model that is trained using monolingual data. In addition to the mathematical formulation of the model we describe approximations used.","Throughout this work, we denote the source language words as f and target language words as e. The source vocabulary is Vf and we write the size of this vocabulary as |Vf |. The same notation holds for the target vocabulary with Ve and |Ve|.","As training criterion for the translation model’s parameters θ, Ravi and Knight (2011) suggest","arg max θ    ∏ f ∑ e P (e) · pθ(f |e)    (1) We would like to obtain θ from Equation 1 using the EM Algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977). This becomes increasingly difficult with more complex translation models. Therefore, we use a simplified 157 translation model that still contains all basic phenomena of a generic translation process. We formu-late the translation process with the same generative story presented in (Ravi and Knight, 2011):","1. Stochastically generate the target sentence according to an n-gram language model.","2. Insert NULL tokens between any two adjacent positions of the target string with uniform probability.","3. For each target token ei (including NULL) choose a foreign translation fi (including NULL) with probability Pθ(fi|ei).","4. Locally reorder any two adjacent foreign words fi−1, fi with probability P (SWAP) = 0.1. 5. Remove the remaining NULL tokens.","In practice, however, it is not feasible to deal with the full parameter table Pθ(fi|ei) which models the lexicon. Instead we only allow translation models where for each source word f the number of words e′","with P (f |e′",") ̸= 0 is below some fixed value. We will refer to this value as the maximum number of candidates of the translation model and denote it with NC . Note that for a given e this does not necessarily restrict the number of entries P (f ′","|e) ̸= 0. Also note that with a fixed value of NC , time and memory complexity of the EM step is O(1) with respect to |Ve| and |Vf |.","In the following we divide the problem of maximizing Equation 1 into two parts: 1. Determining a set of active lexicon entries.","2. Choosing the translation probabilities for the given set of active lexicon entries.","The second task can be achieved by running the EM algorithm on the restricted translation model. We deal with the first task in the following section."]},{"title":"4 Monolingual Context Similarity","paragraphs":["As described in Section 3 we need some mechanism to iteratively choose an active set of translation candidates. Based on the assumption that some of the active candidates and their respective probabilities are already correct, we induce new active candidates. In the context of information retrieval, Salton et al. (1975) introduce a document space where each document identified by one or more index terms is represented by a high dimensional vector of term weights. Given two vectors v1 and v2 of two documents it is then possible to calculate a similarity coefficient between those given documents (which is usually denoted as s(v1, v2)). Similar to this we represent source and target words in a high dimensional vector space of target word weights which we call context vectors and use a similarity coefficient to find possible translation pairs. We first initialize these context vectors using the following procedure:","1. Using only the monolingual data for the target language, prepare the context vectors vei with entries vei,ej :","(a) Initialize all vei,ej = 0","(b) For each target sentence E:","For each word ei in E:","For each word ej ̸= ei in E:","vei,ej = vei,ej + 1.","(c) Normalize each vector vei such that ∑ ej","(vei,ej )2 ! = 1 holds.

Prepare context vectors vfi,ej for the source language using only the monolingual data for the source language and the translation model’s current parameter estimate θ:","(a) Initialize all vfi,ej = 0","(b) Let Ẽθ(F ) denote the most probable translation of the foreign sentence F obtained by using the current estimate θ.","(c) For each source sentence F :","For each word fi in F :","For each word ej ̸= Eθ(fi)1","in","Eθ(F ):","vfi,ej = vfi,ej + 1","(d) Normalize each vector vfi such that ∑ ej","(vfi,ej )2 ! = 1 holds. 1 denoting that ej is not the translation of fi in Eθ(F ) 158 Adapting the notation described above, these vectors might for example look like Arbeit = (early : 0.25, late : 0.05, . . . ) Zeit = (early : 0.15, late : 0.25, . . . ) Once we have set up the context vectors ve and vf , we can retrieve translation candidates for some source word f by finding those wordse′","that maximize the similarity coefficient s(ve′, vf ), as well as candidates for a given target word e by finding those words f ′","that maximize s(v","e, vf′). In our implementation we use the Euclidean distance d(ve, vf ) = ||ve − vf ||2. (2) as distance measure.2","The normalization of context vectors described above is motivated by the fact that the context vectors should be invariant with respect to the absolute number of occurrences of words.3","Instead of just finding the best candidates for a given word, we are interested in an assignment that involves all source and target words, minimizing the sum of distances between the assigned words. In case of a one-to-one mapping the problem of assigning translation candidates such that the sum of distances is minimal can be solved optimally in polynomial time using the hungarian algorithm (Kuhn, 1955). In our case we are dealing with a many-to-many assignment that needs to satisfy the maximum number of candidates constraints. For this, we solve the problem in a greedy fashion by simply choosing the best pairs (e, f ) first. As soon as a target word e or source word f has reached the limit of maximum candidates, we skip all further candidates for that word e (or f respectively). This step involves calculating and sorting all |Ve| · |Vf | distances which can be done in time O(V 2","· log(V )), with V = max(|Ve|, |Vf |). A simplified example of this procedure is depicted in Figure 1. The example already shows that the assignment obtained by this algorithm is in general not optimal.","2","We then obtain pairs (e, f) that minimize d.","3","This gives the same similarity ordering as using unnormalized vectors with the cosine similarity measure","ve·v","f ||ve||","2·||v","f ||","2 which can be interpreted as measuring the cosine of the angle between the vectors, see (Manning et al., 2008).

With the obtained best translations we induce new translation candidates using context similarity. This procedure is depicted in Figure 2. 5.1 Initialization Let NC be the maximum number of candidates per source word we allow, Ve and Vf be the target/source vocabulary and r(e) and r(f ) the frequency rank of a source/target word. Each word f ∈ Vf with frequency rank r(f ) is assigned to all words e ∈ Ve with frequency rank r(e) ∈ [ start(f ) , end(f ) ] (3) where start(f) = max(0 , min ( |Ve| − Nc , ⌊ |Ve| |Vf | · r(f) − Nc 2 ⌋ ) ) (4) end(f) = min (start(f) + Nc, |Ve|) . (5) This defines a diagonal beam4","when visualizing the lexicon entries in a matrix where both source and target words are sorted by their frequency rank. However, note that the result of sorting by frequency 4","The diagonal has some artifacts for the highest and lowest frequency ranks. See, for example, left side of Figure 2. 159 Initialization tar get w ords source words EM Iterations tar get w ords source words Context V ectors tar get w ords source words EM Iterations"]},{"title":". . .","paragraphs":["Figure 2: Visualization of the training procedure. The big rectangles represent word lexica in different stages of the training procedure. The small rectangles represent word pairs (e, f ) for which e is a translation candidate of f , while dots represent word pairs (e, f ) for which this is not the case. Source and target words are sorted by frequency so that the most frequent source words appear on the very left, and the most frequent target words appear at the very bottom. and thus the frequency ranks are not unique when there are words with the same frequency. In this case, we initially obtain some not further specified frequency ordering, which is then kept throughout the procedure.","This initialization proves useful as we show by taking an IBM1 lexicon P (f |e) extracted on the parallel VERBMOBIL corpus (Wahlster, 2000): For each word e we calculate the weighted rank difference ∆ravg(e) = ∑ f P (f |e) · |(r(e) − r(f )| (6) and count how many of those weighted rank differences are smaller than a given value NC","2 . Here we see that for about 1% of the words the weighted rank difference lies within NC = 50, and even about 3% for NC = 150 respectively. This shows that the initialization provides a first solid guess of possible translations. 5.2 EM Algorithm The generative story described in Section 3 is implemented as a cascade of a permutation, insertion, lexicon, deletion and language model finite state transducers using OpenFST (Allauzen et al., 2007). Our FST representation of the LM makes use of failure transitions as described in (Allauzen et al., 2003). We use the forward-backward algorithm on the composed transducers to efficiently train the lexicon model using the EM algorithm. 5.3 Context Vector Step Given the trained parameters θ from the previous run of the EM algorithm we set the context vectors ve and vf up as described in Section 4. We then calculate and sort all |Ve|·|Vf | distances which proves feasible in a few CPU hours even for vocabulary sizes of more than 50,000 words. This is achieved with the GNU SORT tool, which uses external sorting for sorting large amounts of data.","To set up the new lexicon we keep the ⌊ NC","2 ⌋ best translations for each source word with respect to P (e|f ), which we obtained in the previous EM run. Experiments showed that it is helpful to also limit the number of candidates per target words. We therefore prune the resulting lexicon using P (f |e) to a maximum of ⌊","N′","C","2 ⌋ candidates per target word","afterwards. Then we fill the lexicon with new can-","didates using the previously sorted list of candidate","pairs such that the final lexicon has at most NC","candidates per source word and at most N ′","C can-","didates per target word. We set N ′ C to some value N ′","C > NC . All experiments in this work were run with N ′","C = 300. Values of N ′","C ≈ NC seem to produce poorer results. Not limiting the number of candidates per target word at all also typically results in weaker performance. After the lexicon is filled with candidates, we initialize the probabilities to be uniform. With this new lexicon the process is iterated starting with the EM training."]},{"title":"6 Experimental Evaluation","paragraphs":["We evaluate our method on three different corpora.","At first we apply our method to non-parallel Spanish/English data that is based on the OPUS corpus (Tiedemann, 2009) and that was also used in (Ravi and Knight, 2011).

In case of the 3-gram LM (Figure 4) the statement only holds with respect to TER. It is notable that during the first iterations TER only improves very little until a large chunk of the language unravels after the third iteration.

The key to our method lies in limiting the translation model to a limited set of translation candidates and then using the EM algorithm to learn the probabilities. Based on the translations obtained with this model we obtain new translation candidates using a context vector approach. This method increased the training speed by a factor of 10-20 compared to methods known in literature and also resulted in a 1.6 BLEU point increase compared to previous approaches. Due to this efficiency improvement we were able to tackle larger tasks, such as a non-parallel version of the VERBMOBIL corpus having a nearly 10 times larger vocabulary. We also had a look at first results of our method on an even larger Task, incorporating a vocabulary of 60,000 words. We have shown that, using a limited set of translation candidates, we can significantly reduce the computational complexity of the learning task. This work serves as a big step towards large-scale unsupervised training for statistical machine translation systems."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work was realized as part of the Quaero Programme, funded by OSEO, French State agency for innovation.
