If only a handful of dense features need to be tuned, minimum error rate training can be done on small tuning sets and is hard to beat in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In contrast, the promise of large-scale discriminative training for SMT is to scale to arbitrary types and numbers of features and to provide sufficient statistical support by parameter estimation on large sample sizes. Features may be lexicalized and sparse, non-local and overlapping, or be designed to generalize beyond surface statistics by incorporating part-of-speech or syntactic labels. The modeler’s goals might be to identify complex properties of translations, or to counter errors of pre-trained translation models and language models by explicitly down-weighting translations that exhibit certain undesired properties. Various approaches to feature engineering for discriminative models have been presented (see Section 2), however, with a few exceptions, discriminative learning in SMT has been confined to training on small tuning sets of a few thousand examples. This contradicts theoretical and practical evidence from machine learning that suggests that larger training samples should be beneficial to improve prediction also in SMT. Why is this?","One possible reason why discriminative SMT has mostly been content with small tuning sets lies in the particular design of the features themselves. For example, the features introduced by Chiang et al. (2008) and Chiang et al. (2009) for an SCFG model for Chinese/English translation are of two types: The first type explicitly counters overestimates of rule counts, or rules with bad overlap points, bad rewrites, or with undesired insertions of target-side terminals. These features are specified in hand-crafted lists based on a thorough analysis of a tuning set. Such finely hand-crafted features will find sufficient statistical support on a few thousand examples and thus do not benefit from larger training sets. The second type of features deploys external information such as syntactic parses or word alignments to penalize bad reorderings or undesired translations of phrases that cross syntactic constraints. At large scale, extraction of such features quickly becomes 11 (1) X → X1 hat X2 versprochen, X1 promised X2 (2) X → X1 hat mir X2 versprochen,","X1 promised me X2 (3) X → X1 versprach X2, X1 promised X2 Figure 1: SCFG rules for translation. infeasible because of costly generation and storage of linguistic annotations. Another possible reason why large training data did not yet show the expected improvements in discriminative SMT is a special overfitting problem of current popular online learning techniques. This is due to stochastic learning on a per-example basis where a weight update on a misclassified example may apply only to a small fraction of data that have been seen before. Thus many features will not generalize well beyond the training examples on which they were introduced.","The goal of this paper is to investigate if and how it is possible to benefit from scaling discriminative training for SMT to large training sets. We deploy generic features for SCFG-based SMT that can efficiently be read off from rules at runtime. Such features include rule ids, rule-local n-grams, or types of rule shapes. Another crucial ingredient of our approach is a combination of parallelized stochastic learning with feature selection inspired by multi-task learning. The simple but effective idea is to randomly divide training data into evenly sized shards, use stochastic learning on each shard in parallel, while performing l1/l2 regularization for joint feature selection on the shards after each epoch, before starting a new epoch with a reduced feature vector averaged across shards. Iterative feature selection procedure is the key to both efficiency and improved prediction: Without interleaving parallelized stochastic learning with feature selection our largest experiments would not be feasible. Selecting features jointly across shards and averaging does counter the overfitting effect that is inherent to stochastic updating. Our resulting models are learned on large data sets, but they are small and outperform models that tune feature sets of various sizes on small development sets.

The focus of many approaches thus has been on feature engineering and on adaptations of machine learning algorithms to the special case of SMT (where gold standard rankings have to be created automatically). Examples for adapted algorithms include Maximum-Entropy Models (Och and Ney, 2002; Blunsom et al., 2008), Pairwise Ranking Perceptrons (Shen et al., 2004; Watanabe et al., 2006; Hopkins and May, 2011), Structured Perceptrons (Liang et al., 2006a), Boosting (Duh and Kirchhoff, 2008; Wellington et al., 2009), Structured SVMs (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006; Hayashi et al., 2009), MIRA (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008; Chiang et al., 2009), and others. Adaptations of the loss functions underlying such algorithms to SMT have recently been described as particular forms of ramp loss optimization (McAllester and Keshet, 2011; Gimpel and Smith, 2012).","All approaches have been shown to scale to large feature sets and all include some kind of regularization method. However, most approaches have been confined to training on small tuning sets. Exceptions where discriminative SMT has been used on large training data are Liang et al. (2006a) who trained 1.5 million features on 67,000 sentences, Blunsom et al. (2008) who trained 7.8 million rules on 100,000 sentences, or Tillmann and Zhang (2006) who used 230,000 sentences for training.","Our approach is inspired by Duh et al. (2010) who applied multi-task learning for improved generalization in n-best reranking. In contrast to our work, Duh et al. (2010) did not incorporate multi-task learning into distributed learning, but defined tasks as n-best lists, nor did they develop new algorithms, but used off-the-shelf multi-task tools."]},{"title":"3 Local Features for Synchronous CFGs","paragraphs":["The work described in this paper is based on the SMT framework of hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007). Translation rules are extracted from word-aligned parallel sentences and can be seen as productions of a synchronous CFG. Examples are rules like (1)-(3) 12 shown in Figure 1. Local features are designed to be readable directly off the rule at decoding time. We use three rule templates in our work:","Rule identifiers: These features identify each rule by a unique identifier. Such features correspond to the relative frequencies of rewrites rules used in standard models.","Rule n-grams: These features identify n-grams of consecutive items in a rule. We use bigrams on source-sides of rules. Such features identify possible source side phrases and thus can give preference to rules including them.2","Rule shape: These features are indicators that abstract away from lexical items to templates that identify the location of sequences of terminal symbols in relation to non-terminal symbols, on both the source- and target-sides of each rule used. For example, both rules (1) and (2) map to the same indicator, namely that a rule is being used that consists of a (NT, term*, NT, term*) pattern on its source side, and an (NT, term*, NT) pattern on its target side. Rule (3) maps to a different template, that of (NT, term*, NT) on source and target sides."]},{"title":"4 Joint Feature Selection in Distributed Stochastic Learning","paragraphs":["The following discussion of learning methods is based on pairwise ranking in a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) framework.

Each l2 norm of a weight column represents the relevance of the corresponding feature across tasks/shards. The l1 sum of the l2 norms en-forces a selection among features based on these norms. Consider for example the two 5-feature, 3-task weight matrices in Figure 2. Assuming the same loss for both matrices, the right-hand side matrix is preferred because of a smaller l1/l2 norm (12 instead of 18). This matrix shares features across tasks which leads to larger l2 norms for some columns (here ||w1||2 and ||w2||2) and forces other columns to zero. This results in shrinking the matrix to those features that are useful across all tasks. 14","w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 wz1 [ 6 4 0 0 0 ] [ 6 4 0 0 0 ] wz2 [ 0 0 3 0 0 ] [ 3 0 0 0 0 ] wz3 [ 0 0 0 2 3 ] [ 2 3 0 0 0 ]","column l2 norm: 6 4 3 2 3 7 5 0 0 0","l1 sum: ⇒ 18 ⇒ 12 Figure 2: l1/l2 regularization enforcing feature selection.","Our algorithm is related to Obozinski et al.

(2003).4","In contrast to these approaches we approximate the gradient by using the weights given by the ranking algorithm itself. This relates our work to weight-based recursive feature elimination (RFE) (Lal et al., 2006).

Also, deploying disk space instead of memory fits perfectly into the MapReduce framework we are working in.

Algorithms 2 and 3 were infeasible to run on Europarl data beyond one epoch because features vectors grew too large to be kept in memory."]},{"title":"6 Discussion","paragraphs":["We presented an approach to scaling discriminative learning for SMT not only to large feature sets but also to large sets of parallel training data. Since inference for SMT (unlike many other learning problems) is very expensive, especially on large training sets, good parallelization is key. Our approach is made feasible and effective by applying joint feature selection across distributed stochastic learning processes. Furthermore, our local features are efficiently computable at runtime. Our algorithms and features are generic and can easily be reimplemented and make our results relevant across datasets and language pairs.","In future work, we would like to investigate more sophisticated features, better learners, and in general improve the components of our system that have been neglected in the current investigation of relative improvements by scaling the size of data and feature sets. Ultimately, since our algorithms are inspired by multi-task learning, we would like to apply them to scenarios where a natural definition of tasks is given. For example, patent data can be characterized along the dimensions of patent classes and patent text fields (Wäschle and Riezler, 2012) and thus are well suited for multi-task translation."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["Stefan Riezler and Patrick Simianer were supported in part by DFG grant “Cross-language Learning-to-Rank for Patent Retrieval”.
