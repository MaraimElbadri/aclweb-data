The availability of high-coverage, generalpurpose knowledge bases enable the automatic identification and disambiguation of entities in text and its applications (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007; McNamee and Dang, 2009; Kwok et al., 2001; Pasca et al., 2006; Weld et al., 2008; Pereira et al., 2009; Kasneci et al., 2009).","Most early works in this area were designed for supervised Information Extraction competitions such as MUC (Sundheim and Chinchor, 1993) and ACE (ACE, 2004; Doddington et al., 2004; Li et al., 2011), which rely on the availability of annotated data. Open Information Extraction (Sekine, 2006; Banko et al., 2007; Bollegala et al., 2010) started as an effort to approach relation extraction in","∗","Work done during an internship at Google Zurich. a completely unsupervised way, by learning regularities and patterns from the web. Two example systems implementing this paradigm are TEXTRUN-NER (Yates et al., 2007) and REVERB (Fader et al., 2011). These systems do not need any manual data or rules, but the relational facts they extract are not immediately disambiguated to entities and relations from a knowledge base.","A different family of unsupervised methods for relation extraction is unsupervised semantic parsing, which aims at clustering entity mentions and relation surface forms, thus generating a semantic representation of the texts on which inference may be used. Some techniques that have been used are Markov Random Fields (Poon and Domingos, 2009) and Bayesian generative models (Titov and Klementiev, 2011). These are quite powerful approaches but have very high computational requirements (cf. (Yao et al., 2011)).","A good trade-off between fully supervised and fully unsupervised approaches is distant supervision, a semi-supervised procedure consisting of finding sentences that contain two entities whose relation we know, and using those sentences as training examples for a supervised classifier (Hoffmann et al., 2010; Wu and Weld, 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2011). A usual problem is that two related entities may co-occur in one sentence for many unrelated reasons. For example, Barack Obama is the president of the United States, but not every sentence including the two entities supports and states this relation. Much of the previous work uses heuristics, e.g. extracting sentences only from encyclopedic entries (Mintz et al., 54 2009; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011), or syntactic restrictions on the sentences and the entity mentions (Wu and Weld, 2010). These are usually defined manually and may need to be adapted to different languages and domains. Manually selected seeds can also be used (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Kozareva and Hovy, 2010).","The main contribution of this work is presenting a variant of distance supervision for relation extraction where we do not use heuristics in the selection of the training data. Instead, we use topic models to discriminate between the patterns that are expressing the relation and those that are ambiguous and can be applied across relations. In this way, high-precision extraction patterns can be learned without the need of any manual intervention."]},{"title":"2 Unsupervised relational pattern learning","paragraphs":["Similar to other distant supervision methods, our approach takes as input an existing knowledge base containing entities and relations, and a textual corpus. In this work it is not necessary for the corpus to be related to the knowledge base. In what follows we assume that all the relations studied are binary and hold between exactly two entities in the knowledge base. We also assume a dependency parser is available, and that the entities have been automatically disambiguated using the knowledge base as sense inventory.","One of the most important problems to solve in distant supervision approaches is to be able to distinguish which of the textual examples that include two related entities, ei and ej, are supporting the relation. This section describes a fully unsupervised solution to this problem, computing the probability that a pattern supports a given relation, which will allow us to determine the most likely relation expressed in any sentence. Specifically, if a sentence contains two entities, ei and ej, connected through a pattern w, our model computes the probability that the pattern is expressing any relation –P (r|w)– for any relation r defined in the knowledge base. Note that we refer to patterns with the symbol w, as they are the words in our topic models. Preprocessing As a first step, the textual corpus is processed and the data is transformed in the following way: (a) the input corpus is parsed and en-Author-book (Mark Twain, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn)","ARG 1","poss ","ARG 2","ARG 1","nn  novels","nn ","ARG 2","ARG 1","nsubj  released ARG","2dobj","ARG 2 ARG","1conj ","ARG 1","nsubj ","wrote ARG 2dobj","ARG 1","poss ","ARG 2 ...

This context may be a complex structure, such as the dependency path joining the two entities, but it is considered for our purposes as a single term; (e) for each relation r relating ei with ej, document Dij is added to collection Cr. Note that if the two entities are related in different ways at the same time, an identical copy of the document Dij will be added to the collection for all those relations.","Figure 1 shows a set of document collections gen-55 Figure 2: Plate diagram of the generative model used. erated for three relations using this procedure. Each relation r has associated a different document collection, which contains one document associated to each entity pair from the knowledge base which is in relation r. The words in each document can be, for example, all the dependency paths that have been observed in the input textual corpus between the two related entities. Each document will contain some very generic paths (e.g. the two entities consecutive in the text) and some more specific paths. Generative model Once these collections are built, we use the generative model from Figure 2 to learn the probability that a dependency path is conveying some relation between the entities it connects. This model is very similar to the one used by Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009) in the context of text summarization. w (the observed variable) represents a pattern between two entities. The topic model φG","captures general patterns that appear for all relations. φD","captures patterns that are specific about a certain entity pair, but which are not generalizable across all pairs with the same relation. Finally φA","contains the patterns that are observed across most pairs related with the same relation. φA is the topic model of interest for us.","We use Gibbs sampling to estimate the different models from the source data. The topic assignments (for each pattern) that are the output of this process are used to estimate P (r|w): when we observe pattern w, the probability that it conveys relation r."]},{"title":"3 Experiments and results Settings","paragraphs":["We use Freebase as our knowledge base. It can be freely downloaded1",". text corpus used contains 33 million English news articles that we downloaded between January 2004 and December 2011. A random sample of 3M of them is used for building the document collections on which to train the topic models, and the remaining 30M is used for testing. The corpus is preprocessed by identifying Freebase entity mentions, using an approach similar to (Milne and Witten, 2008), and parsing it with an inductive dependency parser (Nivre, 2006).","From the three million training documents, a set of document collections (one per relation) has been generated, by considering the sentences that contain two entities which are related in FreeBase through any binary relation and restricting to high-frequency 200 relations. Two ways of extracting patterns have been used: (a) Syntactic, taking the dependency path between the two entities, and (b) Intertext, taking the text between the two. In both cases, a topic model has been trained to learn the probability of a relation given a pattern w: p(r|w). For λ we use symmetric Dirichlet priors λG = 0.1 and λD = λA = 0.001, following the intuition that for the background the probability mass across patterns should be more evenly distributed. γ is set as (15, 15, 1), indicating in the prior that we expect more patterns to belong to the background and entity-pair-specific distributions due to the very noisy nature of the input data. These values have not been tuned.","As a baseline, using the same training corpus, we have calculated p(r|w) using the maximum likelihood estimate: the number of times that a pattern w has been seen connecting two entities for which r holds divided by the total frequency of the pattern. Extractions evaluation The patterns have been applied to the 30 million documents left for testing. For each pair of entities disambiguated as FreeBase entities, if they are connected through a known pattern, they are assigned arg maxr p(r|w). We have randomly sampled 4,000 such extractions and sent them to raters. An extraction is to be judged correct if both it is correct in real life and the sentence from which it was extracted really supports it. We 1 http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/Data dumps 56 Figure 3: Evaluation of the extractions. X-axis has the threshold for p(r|w), and Y-axis has the precision of the extractions as a percentage. have collected three ratings per example and taken the majority decision. There was disagreement for 9.4% of the items on whether the sentence supports the relation, and for 20% of the items on whether the relation holds in the real world.","The results for different thresholds of p(r|w) are shown in Figure 3. As can be seen, the MLE base-lines (in red with syntactic patterns and green with intertext) perform consistently worse than the models learned using the topic models (in pink and blue). The difference in precision, aggregated across all relations, is statistically significant at 95% confidence for most of the thresholds. Extractions aggregation We can take advantage of redundancy on the web to calculate a support metric for the extractions. In this experiment, for every extracted relation (r, e1, e2), for every occurrence of a pattern wi connecting e1 and e2, we add up p(r|wi). Extractions that are obtained many times and from high-precision patterns will rank higher.","Table 1 describes the results of this aggregation. We have considered the top four highest-frequency relations for people. After aggregating all the extracted relations and ranking them by support, we have divided the evaluation set into two parts: (a) for relations that were not already in FreeBase, we evaluate the precision; (b) for extractions that were already in FreeBase, we take the top-confidence sentence identified and evaluate whether the sentence is providing support to the relation. For each of these, both syntactic patterns and intermediate-text patterns have been evaluated.","The results are very interesting: using syntax, Death place appears easy to extract new relations and to find support. The patterns obtained are quite unambiguous, e.g. ARG1 subj  died at prep  home pobj  in prep  ARG2 pobj  Relation Unknown relations Known relations","Correct relation P@50 Sentence support P@50","Syntax Intertext Syntax Intertext Parent 0.58 0.38 1.00 1.00 Death place 0.90 0.68 0.98 0.94 Birth place 0.38 0.56 0.54 0.98 Nationality 0.86 0.78 0.34 0.40 Table 1: Evaluation on aggregated extractions. On the other hand, birth place and nationality have very different results for new relation acquisition vs. finding sentence support for new relations. The reason is that these relations are very correlated to other relations that we did not have in our training set. In the case of birth place, many relations refer to having an official position in the city, such as mayor; and for nationality, many of the patterns extract presidents or ministers. Not having mayor or president in our initial collection (see Figure 1), the support for these patterns is incorrectly learned. In the case of nationality, however, even though the extracted sentences do not support the relation (P@50 = 0.34 for intertext), the new relations extracted are mostly correct (P@50 = 0.86) as most presidents and ministers in the real world have the nationality of the country where they govern."]},{"title":"4 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have described a new distant supervision model with which to learn patterns for relation extraction with no manual intervention. Results are promising, we could obtain new relations that are not in FreeBase with a high precision for some relation types. It is also useful to extract support sentences for known relations. More work is needed in understanding which relations are compatible or overlapping and which ones can partially imply each other (such as president-country or born in-mayor). 57"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["ACE. 2004.
