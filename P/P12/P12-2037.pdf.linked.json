Some commercial natural language search engines such as InQuira and Ask have also been developed to answer this type of queries. One major challenge is that various questions can be formulated for the same information need. Table 1 shows some alternative expressions for the question “how far is it from Boston to Seattle”. It is difficult for search systems to achieve satisfactory retrieval performance without consider-ing these alternative expressions.","In this paper, we propose a method of automatically mining 5w1h question1","reformulation patterns to improve the search relevance of 5w1h questions. Question reformulations represent the alternative expressions for 5w1h questions. A question","∗","Contribution during internship at Microsoft Research Asia","1","5w1h questions start with “Who”, “What”, “Where”, “When”, “Why” and “How”.","Table 1: Alternative expressions for the original question","Original Question: how far is it from Boston to Seattle","Alternative Expressions: how many miles is it from Boston to Seattle distance from Boston to Seattle Boston to Seattle how long does it take to drive from Boston to Seattle reformulation pattern generalizes a set of similar question reformulations that share the same structure. For example, users may ask similar questions “how far is it from X1 to X2” where X1 and X2 represent some other cities besides Boston and Seattle. Then, similar question reformulations as in Table 1 will be generated with the city names changed. These patterns increase the coverage of the system by handling the queries that did not appear before but share similar structures as previous queries.","Using reformulation patterns as the key concept, we propose a question reformulation framework. First, we mine the question reformulation patterns from search logs that record users’ reformulation behavior. Second, given a new question, we use the most relevant reformulation patterns to generate question reformulations and each of the reformulations is associated with its probability. Third, the original question and these question reformulations are then combined together for retrieval.","The contributions of this paper are summarized as two folds. First, we propose a simple yet effective approach to automatically mine 5w1h question reformulation patterns. Second, we conduct comprehensive studies in improving the search performance of 5w1h questions using the mined patterns. 187 Generating Reformulation Patterns Search Log Set= { (q,qr)} Pattern Base P= { (p,pr)} O ffline Phase","qnew  Generating Question Reformulations","{ qrnew } Retrieval","Model { D } New Question Question Reformulation Retrieved Documents O nline Phase Figure 1: The framework of reformulating questions."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["In the Natural Language Processing (NLP) area, different expressions that convey the same meaning are referred as paraphrases (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Pang et al., 2003; Pasça and Dienes, 2005; Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Bhagat and Ravichandran, 2008; Callison-Burch, 2008; Zhao et al., 2008). Para-phrases have been studied in a variety of NLP applications such as machine translation (Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006; Callison-Burch et al., 2006), question answering (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) and document summarization (McKeown et al., 2002). Yet, little research has considered improving web search performance using paraphrases.","Query logs have become an important resource for many NLP applications such as class and attribute extraction (Pasça and Van Durme, 2008), paraphrasing (Zhao et al., 2010) and language modeling (Huang et al., 2010). Little research has been conducted to automatically mine 5w1h question reformulation patterns from query logs.","Recently, query reformulation (Boldi et al., 2009; Jansen et al., 2009) has been studied in web search. Different techniques have been developed for query segmentation (Bergsma and Wang, 2007; Tan and Peng, 2008) and query substitution (Jones et al., 2006; Wang and Zhai, 2008). Yet, most previous research focused on keyword queries without considering 5w1h questions."]},{"title":"3 Mining Question Reformulation Patterns for Web Search","paragraphs":["Our framework consists of three major components, which is illustrated in Fig. 1. Table 2: Question reformulation patterns generated for the query pair (“how far is it from Boston to Seattle” ,“distance from Boston to Seattle”). S1 = {Boston}:(“how far is it from X1 to Seattle” ,“distance from X1 to Seattle”) S2 = {Seattle}:(“how far is it from Boston to X1” ,“distance from Boston to X1”) S3 = {Boston, Seattle}:(“how far is it from X1 to X2” ,“distance from X1 to X2”) 3.1 Generating Reformulation Patterns From the search log, we extract all successive query pairs issued by the same user within a certain time period where the first query is a 5w1h question. In such query pair, the second query is considered as a question reformulation. Our method takes these query pairs, i.e. Set = {(q, qr)}, as the input and outputs a pattern base consisting of 5w1h question reformulation patterns, i.e. P = {(p, pr)}). Specifically, for each query pair (q, qr), we first collect all common words between q and qr except for stopwords ST 2",", where CW = {w|w ∈ q, w ∈ q′",", w /∈ ST }. For any non-empty subset Si of CW , the words in Si are replaced as slots in q and qr to construct a reformulation pattern. Table 2 shows examples of question reformulation patterns. Finally, the patterns observed in many different query pairs are kept. In other words, we rely on the frequency of a pattern to filter noisy patterns. Generating patterns using more NLP features such as the parsing information will be studied in the future work. 3.2 Generating Question Reformulations We describe how to generate a set of question reformulations {qnew","r } for an unseen question qnew",".","First, we search P = {(p, pr)} to find all question reformulation patterns where p matches qnew",". Then, we pick the best question pattern p⋆","according to the number of prefix words and the total number of words in a pattern.

A web collection from a commercial search engine is used for retrieval experiments. For each question, the relevance judgments are provided by human annotators. The standard NDCG@k is used to measure performance. 4.1 Examples and Performance Table 3 shows examples of the generated questions reformulations. Several interesting expressions are generated to reformulate the original question.","We compare the retrieval performance of using the question reformulations (QDist) with the performance of using the original question (Orig) in Table 4. The parameter λ of QDist is decided using tenfold cross validation. Two sided t-test are conducted to measure significance.","Table 4 shows that using the question reformulations can significantly improve the retrieval performance of natural language questions. Note that, considering the scale of experiments (10,000 queries), around 3% improvement with respect to NDCG is a very interesting result for web search. 4.2 Analysis In this subsection, we analyze the results to better understand the effect of question reformulations.","First, we report the performance of always picking the best question reformulation for each query (denoted as Upper) in Table 5, which provides an","4","www.lemurproject.org/ 189","Table 5: Performance of the upper bound.","NDCG@1 NDCG@3 NDCG@5 Orig 0.2946 0.2923 0.2991 QDist 0.3032 0.2991 0.3067 Upper 0.3826 0.3588 0.3584","Table 6: Best reformulation within different positions. top 1 within top 2 within top 3 49.2% 64.7% 75.4% upper bound for the performance of the question reformulation. Table 5 shows that if we were able to always picking the best question reformulation, the performance of Orig could be improved by around 30% (from 0.2926 to 0.3826 with respect to NDCG@1). It indicates that we do generate some high quality question reformulations.","Table 6 further reports the percent of those 10,000 queries where the best question reformulation can be observed in the top 1 position, within the top 2 posi-tions and within the top 3 positions, respectively.","Table 6 shows that for most queries, our method successfully ranks the best reformulation within the top 3 positions.","Second, we study the effect of different types of question reformulations. We roughly divide the question reformulations generated by our method into five categories as shown in Table 7. For each category, we report the percent of reformulations which performance is bigger/smaller/equal with respect to the original question.","Table 7 shows that the “more specific” reformulations and the “equivalent” reformulations are more likely to improve the original question. Reformulations that make “morphological change” do not have much effect on improving the original question. “More general” and “not relevant” reformulations usually decrease the performance.","Third, we conduct the error analysis on the question reformulations that decrease the performance of the original question. Three typical types of errors are observed. First, some important words are removed from the original question. For example, “what is the role of corporate executives” is reformulated as “corporate executives”. Second, the reformulation is too specific. For example, “how to effectively organize your classroom” is reformulated as “how to effectively organize your elementary classroom”. Third, some reformulations entirely change Table 7: Analysis of different types of reformulations. Type increase decrease same Morphological change 11% 10% 79% Equivalent meaning 32% 30% 38% More specific/Add words 45% 39% 16% More general/Remove words 38% 48% 14% Not relevant 14% 72% 14% Table 8: Retrieval Performance of other query processing techniques.","NDCG@1 NDCG@3 NDCG@5 ORIG 0.2720 0.2937 0.3151 NoStop 0.2697 0.2893 0.3112 DropOne 0.2630 0.2888 0.3102 QDist 0.2978 0.3052 0.3250 the meaning of the original question. For example, “what is the adjective of anxiously” is reformulated as “what is the noun of anxiously”.","Fourth, we compare our question reformulation method with two long query processing techniques, i.e. NoStop (Huston and Croft, 2010) and DropOne (Balasubramanian et al., 2010). NoStop removes all stopwords in the query and DropOne learns to drop a single word from the query. The same query set as Balasubramanian et al. (2010) is used. Table 8 reports the retrieval performance of different methods.","Table 8 shows that both NoStop and DropOne perform worse than using the original question, which indicates that the general techniques developed for long queries are not appropriate for natural language questions. On the other hand, our proposed method outperforms all the baselines."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Improving the search relevance of natural language questions poses a great challenge for search systems.
