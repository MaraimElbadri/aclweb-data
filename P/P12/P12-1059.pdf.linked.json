Querying for a dish on Google yields recipe filters such as cook time, calories, and ingredients. Querying for a movie on Yahoo triggers user ratings, cast, tweets and showtimes. Bing further allows the movie to be directly added to the user’s Netflix queue. Entity repositories such as Freebase, IMDB, Facebook Pages, Factual, Pricegrabber, and Wikipedia are in-creasingly leveraged to enable such experiences.","There are, however, inherent problems in the entity repositories: (a) coverage: although coverage of head entity types is often reliable, the tail can be sparse; (b) noise: created by spammers, extraction errors or errors in crowdsourced content; (c) ambiguity: multiple types or entity identifiers are often associated with the same surface string; and (d) over-expression: many entities have types that are never used in the context of Web search.","There is an opportunity to automatically tailor knowledge repositories to the Web search scenario. Desirable capabilities of such a system include: (a) determining the prior type distribution in Web search for each entity in the repository; (b) assigning a type distribution to new entities; (c) inferring the correct sense of an entity in a particular query context; and (d) adapting to a search engine and time period.","In this paper, we build such a system by leveraging Web search usage logs with large numbers of user sessions seeking or transacting on entities. We cast the task as performing probabilistic inference in a graphical model that captures how queries are generated, and then apply the model to contextually recognize entity types in new queries. We motivate and design several generative models based on the theory that search users’ (unobserved) intents govern the types of entities, the query formulations, and the ultimate clicks on Web documents. We show that jointly modeling user intent and entity type significantly outperforms the current state of the art on the task of entity type resolution in queries. The major contributions of our research are:","• We introduce the idea that latent user intents can be an important factor in modeling type distributions over entities in Web search.","• We propose generative models and inference procedures using signals from query context, click, entity, entity type, and user intent. 563","• We propose an efficient learning technique and a robust implementation of our models, using real-world query data, and a realistic large set of entity types.","• We empirically show that our models outperform the state of the art and that modeling latent intent contributes significantly to these results."]},{"title":"2 Related Work 2.1 Finding Semantic Classes","paragraphs":["A closely related problem is that of finding the semantic classes of entities. Automatic techniques for finding semantic classes include unsupervised clustering (Schütze, 1998; Pantel and Lin, 2002), hyponym patterns (Hearst, 1992; Pantel et al., 2004; Kozareva et al., 2008), extraction patterns (Etzioni et al., 2005), hidden Markov models (Ritter et al., 2009), classification (Rahman and Ng, 2010) and many others. These techniques typically leverage large corpora, while projects such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) have employed editors to manually enumerate words and entities with their semantic classes.","The aforementioned methods do not use query logs or explicitly determine the relative probabilities of different entity senses. A method might learn that there is independently a high chance of eBay being a website and an employer, but does not specify which usage is more common. This is especially problematic, for example, if one wishes to leverage Freebase but only needs the most commonly used senses (e.g., Al Gore is a US Vice President), rather than all possible obscure senses (Freebase contains 30+ senses, including ones such as Impersonated Celebrity and Quotation Subject). In scenarios such as this, our proposed method can in-crease the usability of systems that find semantic classes. We also expand upon text corpora methods in that the type priors can adapt to Web search signals. 2.2 Query Log Mining Query logs have traditionally been mined to improve search (Baeza-Yates et al., 2004; Zhang and Nasraoui, 2006), but they can also be used in place of (or in addition to) text corpora for learning semantic classes. Query logs can contain billions of entries, they provide an independent signal from text corpora, their timestamps allow the learning of type priors at specific points in time, and they can contain information such as clickthroughs that are not found in text corpora. Sekine and Suzuki (2007) used frequency features on context words in query logs to learn semantic classes of entities. Pasça (2007) used extraction techniques to mine instances of semantic classes from query logs. Rüd et al. (2011) found that cross-domain generalizations learned from Web search results are applicable to NLP tasks such as NER. Alfonseca et al. (2010) mined query logs to find attributes of entity instances. However, these projects did not learn relative probabilities of different senses. 2.3 User Intents in Search Learning from query logs also allows us to leverage the concept of user intents. When users submit search queries, they often have specific intents in mind. Broder (2002) introduced 3 top level intents: Informational (e.g., wanting to learn), Navigational (wanting to visit a site), and Transactional (e.g., wanting to buy/sell). Rose and Levinson (2004) further divided these into finer-grained subcategories, and Yin and Shah (2010) built hierarchical taxonomies of search intents. Jansen et al. (2007), Hu et al. (2009), and Radlinski et al. (2010) examined how to infer the intent of queries. We are not aware of any other work that has leveraged user intents to learn type distributions. 2.4 Topic Modeling on Query Logs The closest work to ours is Guo et al.’s (2009) research on Named Entity Recognition in Queries. Given an entity-bearing query, they attempt to identify the entity and determine the type posteriors. Our work significantly scales up the type posteriors component of their work. While they only have four potential types (Movie, Game, Book, Music) for each entity, we employ over 70 popular types, allow-ing much greater coverage of real entities and their types. Because they only had four types, they were able to hand label their training data. In contrast, our system self-labels training examples by search-ing query logs for high-likelihood entities, and must handle any errors introduced by this process. Our models also expand upon theirs by jointly modeling 564 entity type with latent user intents, and by incorporating click signals.","Other projects have also demonstrated the utility of topic modeling on query logs. Carman et al. (2010) modeled users and clicked documents to personalize search results and Gao et al. (2011) applied topic models to query logs in order to improve document ranking for search."]},{"title":"3 Joint Model of Types and User Intents","paragraphs":["We turn our attention now to the task of mining the type distributions of entities and of resolving the type of an entity in a particular query context. Our approach is to probabilistically describe how entity-bearing queries are generated in Web search. We theorize that search queries are governed by a latent user intent, which in turn influences the entity types, the choice of query words, and the clicked hosts. We develop inference procedures to infer the prior type distributions of entities in Web search as well as to resolve the type of an entity in a query, by maximizing the probability of observing a large collection of real-world queries and their clicked hosts.","We represent a query q by a triple {n1, e, n2}, where e represents the entity mentioned in the query, n1 and n2 are respectively the pre- and post-entity contexts (possibly empty), referred to as refiners. Details on how we obtain our corpus are presented in Section 4.2. 3.1 Intent-based Model (IM) In this section we describe our main model, IM, illustrated in Figure 1. We derive a learning algorithm for the model in Section 3.2 and an inference procedure in Section 3.3.","Recall our discussion of intents from Section 2.3. The unobserved semantic type of an entity e in a query is strongly correlated with the unobserved user intent. For example, if a user queries for “ song”, then she is likely looking to ‘listen to it’, ‘download it’, ‘buy it’, or ‘find lyrics’ for it. Our model incorporates this user intent as a latent variable.","The choice of the query refiner words,n1 and n2, is also clearly influenced by the user intent. For example, refiners such as “lyrics” and “words” are more likely to be used in queries where the intent is","For each query/click pair {q, c} type t ∼ M ultinomial(τ ) intent i ∼ M ultinomial(θt) entity e ∼ M ultinomial(ψt) switch s1 ∼ Bernoulli(σi) switch s2 ∼ Bernoulli(σi) if (s1) l-context n1 ∼ M ultinomial(φi) if (s2) r-context n2 ∼ M ultinomial(φi) click c ∼ M ultinomial(ωi) Table 1: Model IM: Generative process for entity-bearing queries. to ‘find lyrics’ than in queries where the intent is to ‘listen’. The same is true for clicked hosts: clicks on “lyrics.com” and “songlyrics.com” are more likely to occur when the intent is to ‘find lyrics’, whereas clicks on “pandora.com” and “last.fm” are more likely for a ‘listen’ intent.","Model IM leverages each of these signals: latent intent, query refiners, and clicked hosts. It generates entity-bearing queries by first generating an entity type, from which the user intent and entity is generated. In turn, the user intent is then used to generate the query refiners and the clicked host. In our data analysis, we observed that over 90% of entity-bearing queries did not contain any refiner wordsn1 and n2. In order to distribute more probability mass to non-empty context words, we explicitly represent the empty context using a switch variable that determines whether a context will be empty.","The generative process for IM is described in Table 1. Consider the query “ ymca lyrics”. Our model first generates the type song, then given the type it generates the entity “ ymca” and the intent ‘find lyrics’. The intent is then used to generate the pre-and post-context words ∅ and “ lyrics”, respectively, and a click on a host such as “ lyrics.com”.","For mathematical convenience, we assume that the user intent is generated independently of the entity itself. Without this assumption, we would require learning a parameter for each intent-type-entity configuration, exploding the number of parameters. Instead, we choose to include these dependencies at the time of inference, as described later.","Recall that q = {n1, e, n2} and let s = {s1, s2}, where s1 = 1 if n1 is not empty and s2 = 1 if n2 is not empty, 0 otherwise.

We compute this quantity exactly by evaluating the joint for each combination of t and i, and the observed values of q and c.","It is important to note that at runtime when a new query is issued, we have to resolve the entity in the absence of any observed click.

Two extensions to this model that we further study in this paper are also shown: Model M0 adds the empty context switch parameter and Model M1 further adds click information. In the interest of space, we omit the update equations for these models, however they are trivial to adapt from the derivations of Model IM presented in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. 3.5 Discussion Full Bayesian Treatment: In the above models, we learn point estimates for the parameters (τ, Θ, Ψ, σ, Φ, Ω). One can take a Bayesian approach and treat these parameters as variables (for instance, with Dirichlet and Beta prior distributions), and perform Bayesian inference. However, exact inference will become intractable and we would need to resort to methods such as variational inference or sampling. We found this extension unnecessary, as we had a sufficient amount of training data to estimate all parameters reliably. In addition, our approach enabled us to learn (and perform inference in) the model with large amounts of data with reasonable computing time. Fitting to an existing Knowledge Base: Although in general our model decodes type distributions for arbitrary entities, in many practical cases it is beneficial to constrain the types to those admissible in a fixed knowledge base (such as Freebase). As an example, if the entity is “ymca”, admissible types may include song, place, and educational institution. When resolving types, during inference, one can restrict the search space to only these admissible types. A desirable side effect of this strategy is that only valid ambiguities are captured in the posterior distribution. 567"]},{"title":"4 Evaluation Methodology","paragraphs":["We refer to QL as a set of English Web search queries issued to a commercial search engine over a period of several months. 4.1 Entity Inventory Although our models generalize to any entity repository, we experiment in this paper with entities cover-ing a wide range of web search queries, coming from 73 types in Freebase. We arrived at these types by grepping for all entities in Freebase within QL, following the procedure described in Section 4.2, and then choosing the top most frequent types such that 50% of the queries are covered by an entity of one of these types1",". 4.2 Training Data Construction In order to learn type distributions by jointly modeling user intents and a large number of types, we require a large set of training examples containing tagged entities and their potential types. Unlike in Guo et al. (2009), we need a method to automatically label QL to produce these training cases since manual annotation is impossible for the range of entities and types that we consider. Reliably recognizing entities in queries is not a solved problem. However, for training we do not require high coverage of entities in QL, so high precision on a sizeable set of query instances can be a proper proxy.","To this end, we collect candidate entities in QL via simple string matching on Freebase entity strings within our preselected 73 types. To achieve high precision from this initial (high-recall, low-precision) candidate set we use a number of heuristics to only retain highly likely entities. The heuristics include retaining only matches on entities that appear capitalized more than 50% in their occurrences in Wikipedia. Also, a standalone score filter (Jain and Pennacchiotti, 2011) of 0.9 is used, which is based on the ratio of string occurrence as","1","In this process, we omitted any non-core Freebase type (e.g., /user/* and /base/*), types used for representation (e.g., /common/* and /type/*), and too general types (e.g., /people/person and /location/location) identified by if a type contains multiple other prominent subtypes. Finally, we conflated seven of the types that overlapped with each other into four types (such as /book/written work and /book/book). an exact match in queries to how often it occurs as a partial match.","The resulting queries are further filtered by keep-ing only those where the pre- and post-entity contexts (n1 and n2) were empty or a single word (accounting for a very large fraction of the queries). We also eliminate entries with clicked hosts that have been clicked fewer than 100 times over the entire QL. Finally, for training we filter out any query with an entity that has more than two potential types2",". This step is performed to reduce recognition errors by limiting the number of potential ambiguous matches. We experimented with various thresholds on allowable types and settled on the value two.","The resulting training data consists of several million queries, 73 different entity types, and approximately 135K different entities, 100K different refiner words, and 40K clicked hosts. 4.3 Test Set Annotation We sampled two datasets, HEAD and TAIL, each consisting of 500 queries containing an entity be-longing to one of the 73 types in our inventory, from a frequency-weighted random sample and a uniform random sample of QL, respectively.","We conducted a user study to establish a gold standard of the correct entity types in each query. A total of seven different independent and paid professional annotators participated in the study. For each query in our test sets, we displayed the query, associated clicked host, and entity to the annotator, along with a list of permissible types from our type inventory. The annotator is tasked with identifying all applicable types from that list, or marking the test case as faulty because of an error in entity identification, bad click host (e.g. dead link) or bad query (e.g. non-English). This resulted in 2,092 test cases ({query, entity, type}-tuples). Each test case was annotated by two annotators. Inter-annotator agreement as measured by Fleiss’ κ was 0.445 (0.498 on HEAD and 0.386 on TAIL), considered moderate agreement.","From HEAD and TAIL, we eliminated three categories of queries that did not offer any interesting type disambiguation opportunities: • queries that contained entities with only one 2 For testing we did not omit any entity or type. 568","HEAD TAIL nDCG MAP MAPW Prec@1 nDCG MAP MAPW Prec@1 BFB 0.71 0.60 0.45 0.30 0.73 0.64 0.49 0.35","Guo′","09 0.79†","0.71†","0.62† 0.51†","0.80†","0.73†","0.66†","0.52†","M0 0.79†","0.72†","0.65†","0.52†","0.82†","0.75†","0.67†","0.57†","M1 0.83‡","0.76‡","0.72‡","0.61‡","0.81†","0.74†","0.67†","0.55†","IM 0.87‡","0.82‡","0.77‡","0.73‡","0.80†","0.72†","0.66†","0.52†","Table 2: Model analysis on HEAD and TAIL. †","indicates statistical significance overBFB, and ‡","over both BFB and","Guo′","09.

For Model IM, we varied the number of user intents (K) in intervals from 100 to 400 (see Figure 3), under the assumption that multiple intents would exist per entity type.","We compare our results against two baselines.

Compared to Model M1, Model IM is statistically significantly better on P rec@1 and not significantly different on the other metrics. Discussion and Error Analysis: Contrary to our results, we had expected improvements for both HEAD and TAIL. Inspection of the TAIL queries revealed that entities were greatly skewed towards people (e.g., actor, author, and politician). Analysis of the latent user intent parameter Θ in Model IM showed that most people types had most of their probability mass assigned to the same three generic and common intents for people types: ‘see pictures of’, ‘find bio-graphical information about’, and ‘see video of’. In other words, latent intents in Model IM are over-expressive and they do not help in differentiating people types.","The largest class of errors came from queries bearing an entity with semantically very similar types where our highest ranked type was not judged correct by the annotators. For example, for the query “ philippine daily inquirer” our system ranked newspaper ahead of periodical but a judge rejected the former and approved the latter. For “ ikea catalogue”, our system ranked magazine ahead of periodical, but again a judge rejected magazine in favor of periodical.","An interesting success case in the TAIL is high-lighted by two queries involving the entity “ ymca”, which in our data can either be a song, place, or educational institution. Our system learns the following priors: 0.63, 0.29, and 0.08, respectively. For the query “ jamestown ymca ny”, IM correctly classified “ymca” as a place and for the query “ ymca palomar” it correctly classified it as an educational institution. We further issued the query “ ymca lyrics” and the type song was then highest ranked.","Our method is generalizable to any entity collection. Since our evaluation focused on the Freebase collection, it remains an open question how noise level, coverage, and breadth in a collection will affect our model performance. Finally, although we do not formally evaluate it, it is clear that training our model on different time spans of queries should lead to type distributions adapted to that time period."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Jointly modeling the interplay between the underlying user intents and entity types in web search queries shows significant improvements over the current state of the art on the task of resolving entity types in head queries. At the same time, no degradation in tail queries is observed. Our proposed models can be efficiently trained using an EM algorithm and can be further used to assign prior type distributions to entities in an existing knowledge base and to in-sert new entities into it.","Although this paper leverages latent intents in search queries, it stops short of understanding the nature of the intents. It remains an open problem to characterize and enumerate intents and to identify the types of queries that benefit most from intent models. 570"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Enrique Alfonseca, Marius Pasca, and Enrique Robledo-Arnuncio. 2010.
