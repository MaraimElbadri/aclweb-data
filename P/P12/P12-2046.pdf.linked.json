Extracting this information has enabled the automated construction of large knowledge bases, containing hundred millions of binary relationships or attribute values about these named entities. However, in reality most knowledge is transient, i.e. changes over time, requiring a temporal dimension in fact extraction. In this paper we develop a methodology that combines label propagation with constraint reasoning for temporal fact extraction. Label propagation aggressively gathers fact candidates, and an Integer Linear Program is used to clean out false hypotheses that violate temporal constraints. Our method is able to improve on recall while keeping up with precision, which we demonstrate by experiments with biography-style Wikipedia pages and a large corpus of news articles."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In recent years, automated fact extraction from Web contents has seen significant progress with the emergence of freely available knowledge bases, such as DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007), YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007), TextRunner (Etzioni et al., 2008), or ReadTheWeb (Carlson et al., 2010a). These knowledge bases are constantly growing and contain currently (by example of DBpedia) several million entities and half a billion facts about them. This wealth of data allows to satisfy the information needs of advanced Internet users by raising queries from keywords to entities. This enables queries like “Who is married to Prince Charles?” or “Who are the teammates of Lionel Messi at FC Barcelona?”.","However, factual knowledge is highly ephemeral: Royals get married and divorced, politicians hold positions only for a limited time and soccer players transfer from one club to another. Consequently, knowledge bases should be able to support more sophisticated temporal queries at entity-level, such as “Who have been the spouses of Prince Charles before 2000?” or “Who are the teammates of Lionel Messi at FC Barcelona in the season 2011/2012?”. In order to achieve this goal, the next big step is to distill temporal knowledge from the Web.","Extracting temporal facts is a complex and time-consuming endeavor. There are “conservative” strategies that aim at high precision, but they tend to suffer from low recall. On the contrary, there are “aggressive” approaches that target at high recall, but frequently suffer from low precision. To this end, we introduce a method that allows us to gain maximum benefit from both “worlds” by “aggressively” gathering fact candidates and subsequently “cleaning-up” the incorrect ones. The salient properties of our approach and the novel contributions of this paper are the following:","• A temporal fact extraction strategy that is able","to efficiently gather thousands of fact candidates","based on a handful of seed facts.","• An ILP solver incorporating constraints on tem-","poral relations among events (e.g., marriage of","a person must be non-overlapping in time).","• Experiments on real world news and Wikipedia","articles showing that we gain recall while keep-","ing up with precision."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Recently, there have been several approaches that aim at the extraction of temporal facts for the automated construction of large knowledge bases, but 233 time-aware fact extraction is still in its infancy. An approach toward fact extraction based on coupled semi-supervised learning for information extraction (IE) is NELL (Carlson et al., 2010b). However, it does neither incorporate constraints nor temporal-ity. TIE (Ling and Weld, 2010) binds time-points of events described in sentences, but does not disambiguate entities or combine observations to facts. A pattern-based approach for temporal fact extraction is PRAVDA (Wang et al., 2011), which utilizes label propagation as a semi-supervised learning strategy, but does not incorporate constraints. Similarly, TOB is an approach of extracting temporal businessrelated facts from free text, which requires deep pars-ing and does not apply constraints as well (Zhang et al., 2008). In contrast, CoTS (Talukdar et al., 2012) introduces a constraint-based approach of coupled semi-supervised learning for IE, however not focus-ing on the extraction part. Building on TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) several works (Verhagen et al., 2005; Mani et al., 2006; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Verhagen et al., 2009; Yoshikawa et al., 2009) identify temporal relationships in free text, but don’t focus on fact extraction."]},{"title":"3 Framework Facts and Observations.","paragraphs":["We aim to extract factual knowledge transient over time from free text. More specifically, we assume time T = [0, Tmax ] to be a finite sequence of time-points with yearly granularity. Furthermore, a fact consists of a relation with two typed arguments and a time-interval defining its validity. For instance, we write worksForClub(Beckham, RMadrid )@[2003, 2008) to express that Beckham played for Real Madrid from 2003 to 2007. Since sentences containing a fact and its full time-interval are sparse, we consider three kinds of textual observations for each relation, namely begin, during, and end. “Beckham signed for Real Madrid from Manchester United in 2003.” includes both the begin observation of Beckham being with Real Madrid as well as the end observation of working for Manchester. A positive seed fact is a valid fact of a relation, while a negative seed fact is incorrect (e.g., for relation worksForClub, a positive seed fact is worksForClub(Beckham, RMadrid ), while worksForClub(Beckham, BMunich) is a negative seed fact). Framework. As depicted in Figure 1, our framework is composed of four stages, where the first collects candidate sentences, the second mines patterns from the candidates sentences, the third extracts temporal facts from the sentences utilizing the patterns and the last removes noisy facts by enforcing constraints. Preprocessing. We retrieve all sentences from the corpus comprising at least two entities and a temporal expression, where we use YAGO for entity recogni-tion and disambiguation (cf. (Hoffart et al., 2011)). Figure 1: System Overview Pattern Analysis. A pattern is a n-gram based feature vector. It is generated by replacing entities by their types, keeping only stemmed nouns, verbs converted to present tense and the last preposition. For example, considering “Beckham signed for Real Madrid from Manchester United in 2003.” the corresponding pattern for the end occurrence is “sign for CLUB from”. We quantify the strength of each pattern by investigating how frequent the pattern occurs with seed facts of a particular relation and how infrequent it appears with negative seed facts. Fact Candidate Gathering. Entity pairs that cooccur with patterns whose strength is above a minimum threshold become fact candidates and are fed into the next stage of label propagation."]},{"title":"4 T-Fact Extraction","paragraphs":["Building on (Wang et al., 2011) we utilize Label Propagation (Talukdar and Crammer, 2009) to determine the relation and observation type expressed by each pattern. Graph. We create a graph G = (VF ∪̇VP , E) having one vertex v ∈ VF for each fact candidate observed in the text and one vertex v ∈ VP for each pattern. Edges between VF and VP are introduced whenever a fact candidate appeared with a pattern. Their weight is derived from the co-occurrence frequency. Edges 234 among VP nodes have weights derived from the n-gram overlap of the patterns. Labels. Moreover, we use one label for each observation type (begin, during, and end) of each relation and a dummy label representing the unknown relation. Objective Function.

Variables. We introduce a variable xr ∈ {0, 1} for each t-fact candidate r ∈ R, where 1 means the candidate is valid. Two variables xf,b, xf,e ∈ [0, Tmax ] denote begin (b) and end (e) of time-interval of a fact f ∈ F . Note, that many t-fact candidates refer to the same fact f , since they share their entity pairs. Objective Function. The objective function intends to maximize the number of valid raw t-facts, where wr is a weight obtained from the previous stage: max ∑ r∈R wr · xr Intra-Fact Constraints. xf,b and xf,e encode a proper time-interval by adding the constraint: ∀f ∈ F xf,b < xf,e Considering only a single relation, we assume the sets Rb, Rd, and Re to comprise its t-fact candidates with respect to the begin, during, and end observations. Then, we introduce the constraints","∀l ∈ {b, e}, r ∈ Rl tl · xr ≤ xf,l (2)","∀l ∈ {b, e}, r ∈ Rl xf,l ≤ tl · xr + (1 − xr)Tmax (3)","∀r ∈ Rd xf,b ≤ tb · xr + (1 − xr)Tmax (4)","∀r ∈ Rd te · xr ≤ xf,e (5) where f has the same entity pair as r and tb, te are begin and end of r’s time-interval. Whenever xr is set to 1 for begin or end t-fact candidates, Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) set the value of xf,b or xf,e to tb or te, respectively. For each during t-fact candidate with xr = 1, Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) enforce xf,b ≤ tb and te ≤ xf,e. Inter-Fact Constraints. Since we can refer to a fact f ’s time interval by xf,b and xf,e and the connectives of Boolean Logic can be encoded in ILPs (Karp, 1972), we can use all temporal constraints expressible by Allen’s Interval Algebra (Allen, 1983) to specify inter-fact constraints. For example, we leverage this by prohibiting marriages of a single person from overlapping in time. Previous Work. In comparison to (Talukdar et al., 2012), our ILP encoding is time-scale invariant. That is, for the same data, if the granularity of T is changed from months to seconds, for example, the size of the ILP is not affected. Furthermore, because we allow all relations of Allen’s Interval Algebra, we support a richer class of temporal constraints."]},{"title":"6 Experiments Corpus.","paragraphs":["Experiments are conducted in the soccer and the celebrity domain by considering the worksForClub and isMarriedTo relation, respectively. For each person in the “FIFA 100 list” and “Forbes 100 list” we retrieve their Wikipedia article. In addition, we obtained about 80,000 documents for the soccer domain and 370,000 documents for the celebrity domain from BBC, The Telegraph, Times Online and ESPN by querying Google’s News Archive Search1 in the time window from 1990-2011. All hyperparameters are tuned on a separate data-set. Seeds. For each relation we manually select the 10 positive and negative fact candidates with highest occurrence frequencies in the corpus as seeds. Evaluation.

Table 1 shows the results on the pipeline model (lower-left), joint model (lower-right), label-propagation w/o noise cleaning (upper-left), and ILP for t-fact extraction w/o noise cleaning (upper-right). Analysis. Regarding the upper part of Table 1 the pattern-based extraction works very well for worksForClub, however it fails on isMarriedTo. The reason is, that the types of worksForClub distinguish the patterns well from other relations. In contrast, isMarriedTo’s patterns interfere with other person-person relations making constraints a decisive asset. When comparing the joint model and the pipeline model, the former sacrifices recall in order to keep up with the latter’s precision level. That is because the joint model’s ILP decides with binary variables on which patterns to accept. In contrast, label propagation addresses the inherent uncertainty by providing label assignments with confidence numbers. 6.2 Increasing Recall Setting. In a second experiment, we move the t-fact extraction stage away from high precision towards higher recall, where the successive noise cleaning stage attempts to restore the precision level. Results. The columns of Table 2 show results for different values of μ1 of Eq. (1). From left to right, we used μ1 = e−1",", 0.6, 0.8 for worksForClub and μ1 = e−2",", e−1",", 0.6 for isMarriedTo. The table’s upper part reports on the output of stage 3, whereas the lower part covers the facts returned by noise cleaning. Analysis. For the conservative setting label propagation produces high precision facts with only few inconsistencies, so the noise cleaning stage has no effect, i.e. no pruning takes place. This is the setting usual pattern-based approaches without cleaning stage are working in. In contrast, for the standard setting (coinciding with Table 1’s left column) stage 3 yields less precision, but higher recall. Since there are more inconsistencies in this setup, the noise cleaning stage accomplishes precision gains compensating for the losses in the previous stage. In the relaxed setting precision drops too low, so the noise cleaning stage is unable to figure out the truly correct facts. In general, the effects on worksForClub are weaker, since in this relation the constraints are less influential. Conservative Standard Relaxed Prec. # Obs. Prec. # Obs.
