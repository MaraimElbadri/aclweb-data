Previous discriminative parsing models usually factor a parse tree into a set of parts. Each part is scored separately to ensure tractability. In dependency parsing (DP), the number of dependencies in a part is called the order of a DP model (Koo and Collins, 2010). Accordingly, existing graph-based DP models can be categorized into tree groups, namely, the first-order (Eisner, 1996; McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald et al., 2005b), second-order (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007) and third-order (Koo and Collins, 2010) models.","Similarly, we can define the order of constituent parsing in terms of the number of grammar rules in a part. Then, the previous discriminative constituent parsing models (Johnson, 2001; Henderson, 2004; Taskar et al., 2004; Petrov and Klein, 2008a;","∗","The research reported in this paper was partially supported by the Research Grants Council of HKSAR, China, through the GRF Grant 9041597 (CityU 144410). Petrov and Klein, 2008b; Finkel et al., 2008) are the first-order ones, because there is only one grammar rule in a part. The discriminative re-scoring models (Collins, 2000; Collins and Duffy, 2002; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Huang, 2008) can be viewed as previous attempts to higher-order constituent parsing, using some parts containing more than one grammar rule as non-local features.","In this paper, we present a higher-order constituent parsing model1","based on these previous works. It allows multiple adjacent grammar rules in each part of a parse tree, so as to utilize more local structural context to decide the plausibility of a grammar rule instance. Evaluated on the PTB WSJ and Chinese Treebank, it achieves its best F1 scores of 91.86% and 85.58%, respectively. Combined with other high-performance parsers under the framework of constituent recombination (Sagae and Lavie, 2006; Fossum and Knight, 2009), this model further enhances the F1 scores to 92.80% and 85.60%, the highest ones achieved so far on these two data sets."]},{"title":"2 Higher-order Constituent Parsing","paragraphs":["Discriminative parsing is aimed to learn a function f : S → T from a set of sentences S to a set of valid parses T according to a given CFG, which maps an input sentence s ∈ S to a set of candidate parses T (s). The function takes the following discriminative form:","f (s) = arg max t∈T (s) g(t, s) (1) 1 http://code.google.com/p/gazaparser/ 1 thea portion of DT will32$ million realized from the sales be ... VPNP NP QP PPVBN IN PP begin(b) split(m) end(e) ... Figure 1: A part of a parse tree centered at NP → NP VP where g(t, s) is a scoring function to evaluate the event that t is the parse of s. Following Collins (2002), this scoring function is formulated in the linear form g(t, s) = θ · Ψ(t, s), (2) where Ψ(t, s) is a vector of features and θ the vector of their associated weights. To ensure tractability, this model is factorized as g(t, s) = ∑ r∈t g(Q(r), s) = ∑ r∈t θ · Φ(Q(r), s), (3) where g(Q(r), s) scores Q(r), a part centered at grammar rule instance r in t, and Φ(Q(r), s) is the vector of features for Q(r). Each Q(r) makes its own contribution to g(t, s). A part in a parse tree is illustrated in Figure 1. It consists of the center grammar rule instance NP → NP VP and a set of immediate neighbors, i.e., its parent PP → IN NP, its children NP → DT QP and VP → VBN PP, and its sibling IN → of. This set of neighboring rule in-stances forms a local structural context to provide useful information to determine the plausibility of the center rule instance. 2.1 Feature The feature vector Φ(Q(r), s) consists of a series of features {φi(Q(r), s))|i ≥ 0}. The first feature φ0(Q(r), s) is calculated with a PCFG-based generative parsing model (Petrov and Klein, 2007), as defined in (4) below, where r is the grammar rule instance A → B C that covers the span from the b-th to the e-th word, splitting at the m-th word, x, y and z are latent variables in the PCFG-based model, and I(·) and O(·) are the inside and outside probabilities, respectively.","All other features φi(Q(r), s) are binary functions that indicate whether a configuration exists in Q(r) and s. These features are by their own nature in two categories, namely, lexical and structural. All features extracted from the part in Figure 1 are demonstrated in Table 1. Some back-off structural features are used for smoothing, which cannot be presented due to limited space. With only lexical features in a part, this parsing model backs off to a first-order one similar to those in the previous works. Adding structural features, each involving a least a neighboring rule instance, makes it a higher-order parsing model. 2.2 Decoding The factorization of the parsing model allows us to develop an exact decoding algorithm for it. Following Huang (2008), this algorithm traverses a parse forest in a bottom-up manner. However, it determines and keeps the best derivation for every grammar rule instance instead of for each node. Because all structures above the current rule instance is not determined yet, the computation of its non-local structural features, e.g., parent and sibling features, has to be delayed until it joins an upper level structure. For example, when computing the score of a derivation under the center rule NP → NP VP in Figure 1, the algorithm will extract child features from its children NP → DT QP and VP → VBN PP. The parent and sibling features of the two child rules can also be extracted from the current derivation and used to calculate the score of this derivation. But parent and sibling features for the center rule will not be computed until the decoding process reaches the rule above, i.e., PP → IN NP.","This algorithm is more complex than the approximate decoding algorithm of Huang (2008). However, its efficiency heavily depends on the size of the parse forest it has to handle.

Suppose each parser generates a k-best parse list for an input sentence, the weight of a candidate constituent c is defined as ω(c) = ∑ i ∑ k λiδ(c, ti,k)f (ti,k), (5) where i is the index of an individual parser, λi the weight indicating the confidence of a parser, δ(c, ti,k) a binary function indicating whether c is contained in ti,k, the k-th parse output from the i-th parser, and f (ti,k) the score of the k-th parse as-signed by the i-th parser, as defined in Fossum and Knight (2009).","The weight of a recombined parse is defined as the sum of weights of all constituents in the parse.

A performance gain of 0.3%-0.4% demonstrates its advantage over its first-order version. Including a PCFG-based model as its basic feature, this model achieves a better performance than previous single and re-scoring parsers, and its combination with other parsers performs even better (by about 1%). More importantly, it extends the existing works into a more general framework of constituent parsing to utilize more lexical and structural context and incorporate more strength of various parsing techniques. However, higher-order constituent parsing inevitably leads to a high computational complexity. We intend to deal with the efficiency problem of our model with some advanced parallel computing technologies in our future works.","4","http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/evalb/ 4"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["E.
