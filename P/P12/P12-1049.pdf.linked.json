Most transliteration mining systems are built using labelled training data or using heuristics to extract transliteration pairs. These systems are language pair dependent or require labelled information for training. Our system extracts transliteration pairs in an unsupervised fashion. It is also able to utilize labelled information if available, obtaining improved performance.","We present a novel model of transliteration mining defined as a mixture of a transliteration model and a non-transliteration model. The transliteration model is a joint source channel model (Li et al., 2004). The non-transliteration model assumes no correlation between source and target word characters, and independently generates a source and a target word using two fixed unigram character models. We use Expectation Maximization (EM) to learn parameters maximizing the likelihood of the interpolation of both sub-models. At test time, we label word pairs as transliterations if they have a higher probability assigned by the transliteration sub-model than by the non-transliteration sub-model.","We extend the unsupervised system to a semi-supervised system by adding a new S-step to the EM algorithm. The S-step takes the probability estimates from unlabelled data (computed in the M-step) and uses them as a backoff distribution to smooth probabilities which were estimated from labelled data. The smoothed probabilities are then used in the next E-step. In this way, the parameters learned by EM are constrained to values which are close to those estimated from the labelled data.","We evaluate our unsupervised and semi-supervised transliteration mining system on the datasets available from the NEWS 2010 shared task on transliteration mining (Kumaran et al., 2010b). We call this task NEWS10 later on. Compared with a baseline unsupervised system our unsupervised system achieves up to 5% better F-measure. On the NEWS10 dataset, our unsupervised system achieves an F-measure of up to 95.7%, and on three language pairs, it performs better than all systems which participated in NEWS10. We also evaluate our semi-supervised system which additionally uses the NEWS10 labelled data for training. It achieves an improvement of up to 3.7% F-measure over our unsupervised system. Additional experiments on parallel corpora show that we are able to effectively mine transliteration pairs from very noisy data.","The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes previous work. Sections 3 and 4 define our unsupervised and semi-supervised models. Section 5 presents the evaluation. Section 6 concludes. 469"]},{"title":"2 Previous Work","paragraphs":["We first discuss the literature on semi-supervised and supervised techniques for transliteration mining and then describe a previously defined unsupervised system. Supervised and semi-supervised systems use a manually labelled set of training data to learn character mappings between source and target strings. The labelled training data either consists of a few hundred transliteration pairs or of just a few carefully selected transliteration pairs. The NEWS 2010 shared task on transliteration mining (NEWS10) (Kumaran et al., 2010b) is a semi-supervised task conducted on Wikipedia InterLanguage Links (WIL) data. The NEWS10 dataset contains 1000 labelled examples (called the “seed data”) for initial training. All systems which participated in the NEWS10 shared task are either supervised or semi-supervised. They are described in (Kumaran et al., 2010a). Our transliteration mining model can mine transliterations without using any labelled data. However, if there is some labelled data available, our system is able to use it effectively.","The transliteration mining systems evaluated on the NEWS10 dataset generally used heuristic methods, discriminative models or generative models for transliteration mining (Kumaran et al., 2010a).","The heuristic-based system of Jiampojamarn et al. (2010) is based on the edit distance method which scores the similarity between source and target words. They presented two discriminative methods – an SVM-based classifier and alignment-based string similarity for transliteration mining. These methods model the conditional probability distribution and require supervised/semi-supervised information for learning. We propose a flexible generative model for transliteration mining usable for both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning.","Previous work on generative approaches uses Hidden Markov Models (Nabende, 2010; Darwish, 2010; Jiampojamarn et al., 2010), Finite State Automata (Noeman and Madkour, 2010) and Bayesian learning (Kahki et al., 2011) to learn transliteration pairs from labelled data. Our method is different from theirs as our generative story explains the unlabelled data using a combination of a transliteration and a non-transliteration sub-model. The transliteration model jointly generates source and target strings, whereas the non-transliteration system generates them independently of each other.","Sajjad et al. (2011) proposed a heuristic-based unsupervised transliteration mining system. We later call it Sajjad11. It is the only unsupervised mining system that was evaluated on the NEWS10 dataset up until now, as far as we know. That system is computationally expensive. We show in Section 5 that its runtime is much higher than that of our system.","In this paper, we propose a novel model-based approach to transliteration mining. Our approach is language pair independent – at least for alphabetic languages – and efficient. Unlike the previous unsupervised system, and unlike the supervised and semi-supervised systems we mentioned, our model can be used for both unsupervised and semi-supervised mining in a consistent way."]},{"title":"3 Unsupervised Transliteration Mining Model","paragraphs":["A source word and its corresponding target word can be character-aligned in many ways. We refer to a possible alignment sequence which aligns a source word e and a target word f as “a”. The function Align(e, f ) returns the set of all valid alignment sequences a of a word pair (e, f ). The joint transliteration probability p1(e, f ) of a word pair is the sum of the probabilities of all alignment sequences: p1(e, f ) = ∑ a∈Align(e,f) p(a) (1)","Transliteration systems are trained on a list of transliteration pairs. The alignment between the transliteration pairs is learned with Expectation Maximization (EM). We use a simple unigram model, so an alignment sequence from function Align(e, f ) is a combination of 0–1, 1–1, and 1– 0 character alignments between a source word e and its transliteration f . We refer to a character alignment unit as “multigram” later on and represent it by the symbol “q”. A sequence of multigrams forms an alignment of a source and target word. The probability of a sequence of multigrams a is the product of the probabilities of the multigrams it contains. p(a) = p(q1, q2, ..., q|a|) = |a| ∏ j=1 p(qj) (2) 470","While transliteration systems are trained on a clean list of transliteration pairs, our transliteration mining system has to learn from data containing both transliterations and non-transliterations. The transliteration model p1(e, f ) handles only the transliteration pairs. We propose a second model p2(e, f ) to deal with non-transliteration pairs (the “non-transliteration model”). Interpolation with the non-transliteration model allows the transliteration model to concentrate on modelling transliterations during EM training. After EM training, transliteration word pairs are assigned a high probability by the transliteration submodel and a low probability by the non-transliteration submodel, and vice versa for non-transliteration pairs. This property is exploited to identify transliterations.","In a non-transliteration word pair, the characters of the source and target words are unrelated. We model them as randomly seeing a source word and a target word together. The non-transliteration model uses random generation of characters from two unigram models. It is defined as follows:","p2(e, f ) = pE(e) pF (f ) (3) pE(e) =","∏|e| i=1 pE(ei) and pF (f ) =","∏|f|","i=1 pF (fi). The transliteration mining model is an interpo-","lation of the transliteration model p1(e, f ) and the","non-transliteration model p2(e, f ): p(e, f ) = (1 − λ)p1(e, f ) + λp2(e, f ) (4) λ is the prior probability of non-transliteration. 3.1 Model Estimation In this section, we discuss the estimation of the parameters of the transliteration model p1(e, f ) and the non-transliteration model p2(e, f ).","The non-transliteration model consists of two unigram character models. Their parameters are estimated from the source and target words of the training data, respectively, and the parameters do not change during EM training.","For the transliteration model, we implement a simplified form of the grapheme-to-phoneme converter, g2p (Bisani and Ney, 2008). In the following, we use notations from Bisani and Ney (2008). g2p learns m-to-n character alignments between a source and a target word. We restrict ourselves to 0–1,1–1,1–0 character alignments and to a unigram model.1","The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to train the model. It maximizes the likelihood of the training data. In the E-step the EM algorithm computes expected counts for the multigrams and in the M-step the multigram probabilities are reestimated from these counts. These two steps are iterated. For the first EM iteration, the multigram probabilities are initialized with a uniform distribution and λ is set to 0.5.","The expected count of a multigram q (E-step) is computed by multiplying the posterior probability of each alignment a with the frequency of q in a and summing these weighted frequencies over all alignments of all word pairs. c(q) = N ∑ i=1 ∑ a∈Align(ei,fi)","(1 − λ)p1(a, ei, fi) p(ei, fi) nq(a) nq(a) is here the number of times the multigram q occurs in the sequence a and p(ei, fi) is defined in Equation 4. The new estimate of the probability of a multigram is given by:","p(q) =","c(q) ∑","q′ c(q′",") (5)","Likewise, we calculate the expected count of non-","transliterations by summing the posterior probabili-","ties of non-transliteration given each word pair: cntr = N ∑ i=1 pntr(ei, fi) = N ∑ i=1 λp2(ei, fi) p(ei, fi) (6) λ is then reestimated by dividing the expected count of non-transliterations by N . 3.2 Implementation Details We use the Forward-Backward algorithm to estimate the counts of multigrams. The algorithm has a forward variable α and a backward variable β which are calculated in the standard way (Deligne and Bimbot, 1995). Consider a node r which is connected with a node s via an arc labelled with the multigram q. The expected count of a transition between r and s is calculated using the forward and backward probabilities as follows:","γ′","rs =","α(r) p(q) β(s) α(E)","(7)","1","In preliminary experiments, using an n-gram order of greater than one or more than one character on the source side or the target side or both sides of the multigram caused the transliteration model to incorrectly learn non-transliteration information from the training data. 471 where E is the final node of the graph.","We multiply the expected count of a transition by the posterior probability of transliteration (1 − pntr(e, f )) which indicates how likely the string pair is to be a transliteration. The counts γrs are then summed for all multigram types q over all training pairs to obtain the frequencies c(q) which are used to reestimate the multigram probabilities according to Equation 5."]},{"title":"4 Semi-supervised Transliteration Mining Model","paragraphs":["Our unsupervised transliteration mining system can be applied to language pairs for which no labelled data is available. However, the unsupervised system is focused on high recall and also mines close transliterations (see Section 5 for details). In a task dependent scenario, it is difficult for the unsupervised system to mine transliteration pairs according to the details of a particular definition of what is considered a transliteration (which may vary somewhat with the task). In this section, we propose an extension of our unsupervised model which overcomes this shortcoming by using labelled data. The idea is to rely on probabilities from labelled data where they can be estimated reliably and to use probabilities from unlabelled data where the labelled data is sparse. This is achieved by smoothing the labelled data probabilities using the unlabelled data probabilities as a backoff. 4.1 Model Estimation We calculate the unlabelled data probabilities in the E-step using Equation 4. For labelled data (contain-ing only transliterations) we set λ = 0 and get: p(e, f ) = ∑ a∈Align(e,f) p1(e, f, a) (8)","In every EM iteration, we smooth the probability distribution in such a way that the estimates of the multigrams of the unlabelled data that do not occur in the labelled data would be penalized. We obtain this effect by smoothing the probability distribution of unlabelled and labelled data using a technique similar to Witten-Bell smoothing (Witten and Bell, 1991), as we describe below. Figure 1: Semi-supervised training 4.2 Implementation Details We divide the training process of semi-supervised mining in two steps as shown in Figure 1. The first step creates a reasonable alignment of the labelled data from which multigram counts can be obtained. The labelled data is a small list of transliteration pairs. Therefore we use the unlabelled data to help correctly align it and train our unsupervised mining system on the combined labelled and unlabelled training data. In the expectation step, the prior probability of non-transliteration λ is set to zero on the labelled data since it contains only transliterations. The first step passes the resulting multigram probability distribution to the second step.","We start the second step with the probability estimates from the first step and run the E-step separately on labelled and unlabelled data. The E-step on the labelled data is done using Equation 8, which forces the posterior probability of non-transliteration to zero, while the E-step on the unlabelled data uses Equation 4. After the two E-steps, we estimate a probability distribution from the counts obtained from the unlabelled data (M-step) and use it as a backoff distribution in computing smoothed probabilities from the labelled data counts (S-step).","The smoothed probability estimate p̂(q) is: p̂(q) =","cs(q) + ηsp(q) Ns + ηs (9) where cs(q) is the labelled data count of the multigram q, p(q) is the unlabelled data probability estimate, and Ns =","∑","q cs(q), and ηs is the number","of different multigram types observed in the Viterbi","alignment of the labelled data. 472"]},{"title":"5 Evaluation","paragraphs":["We evaluate our unsupervised system and semi-supervised system on two tasks, NEWS10 and parallel corpora. NEWS10 is a standard task on transliteration mining from WIL. On NEWS10, we compare our results with the unsupervised mining system of Sajjad et al. (2011), the best supervised and semi-supervised systems presented at NEWS10 (Kumaran et al., 2010b) and the best supervised and semi-supervised results reported in the literature for the NEWS10 task. For the challenging task of mining from parallel corpora, we use the English/Hindi and English/Arabic gold standard provided by Sajjad et al. (2011) to evaluate our results. 5.1 Experiments using the NEWS10 Dataset We conduct experiments on four language pairs: English/Arabic, English/Hindi, English/Tamil and English/Russian using data provided at NEWS10. Every dataset contains training data, seed data and reference data. The NEWS10 data consists of pairs of titles of the same Wikipedia pages written in different languages, which may be transliterations or translations. The seed data is a list of 1000 transliteration pairs provided to semi-supervised systems for initial training. We use the seed data only in our semi-supervised system, and not in the unsupervised system. The reference data is a small subset of the training data which is manually annotated with positive and negative examples. 5.1.1 Training","We word-aligned the parallel phrases of the training data using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), and symmetrized the alignments using the grow-diagfinal-and heuristic (Koehn et al., 2003). We extract all word pairs which occur as 1-to-1 alignments (like Sajjad et al. (2011)) and later refer to them as the word-aligned list. We compared the word-aligned list with the NEWS10 reference data and found that the word-aligned list is missing some transliteration pairs because of word-alignment errors. We built an-other list by adding a word pair for every source word that cooccurs with a target word in a parallel phrase/sentence and call it the cross-product list later on. The cross-product list is noisier but contains almost all transliteration pairs in the corpus.

Table 2 shows on three language pairs, our semi-supervised system OS only achieves a small gain in F-measure over our unsupervised system OU . This shows that the unlabelled training data is already providing most of the transliteration information. The seed data is used to help the transliteration mining system to learn the right definition of transliteration. On the English/Russian dataset, our semi-supervised system achieves almost 7% increase in precision with a 2.2% drop in recall compared to our unsupervised system. This provides a 3.7% gain on F-measure. The increase in precision shows that the seed data is helping the system in disambiguating transliteration pairs from cognates. 5.1.4 Discussion","The unsupervised system produces lists with high recall. The semi-supervised system tends to better balance out precision and recall. Table 3 compares the precision, recall and F-measure of our unsupervised and semi-supervised mining systems.","The errors made by our semi-supervised system can be classified into the following categories:","Pronunciation differences: English proper names may be pronounced differently in other languages. Sometimes, English short vowels are converted to long vowels in Hindi such as the English word “Lanthanum” which is pronounced “Laanthanum” in Hindi. Our transliteration mining system wrongly extracts such pairs as transliterations.","In some cases, different vowels are used in two languages. The English word “January” is pronounced as “Janvary” in Hindi. Such word pairs are non-transliterations according to the gold standard but our system extracts them as transliterations. Ta-474 Table 4: Word pairs with pronunciation differences Table 5: Examples of word pairs which are wrongly annotated as transliterations in the gold standard ble 4 shows a few examples of such word pairs.","Inconsistencies in the gold standard: There are several inconsistencies in the gold standard where our transliteration system correctly identifies a word pair as a transliteration but it is marked as a non-transliteration or vice versa. Consider the example of the English word “George” which is pronounced as “Jaarj” in Hindi. Our semi-supervised system learns this as a non-transliteration but it is wrongly annotated as a transliteration in the gold standard.","Arabic nouns have an article “al” attached to them which is translated in English as “the”. There are various cases in the training data where an English noun such as “Quran” is matched with an Arabic noun “alQuran”. Our mining system classifies such cases as non-transliterations, but 24 of them are incorrectly annotated as transliterations in the gold standard. We did not correct this, and are therefore penalized. Kahki et al. (2011) preprocessed such Arabic words and separated “al” from the noun “Quran” before mining. They report a match if the version of the Arabic word with “al” appears with the corresponding English word in the gold standard. Table 5 shows examples of word pairs which are wrongly annotated as transliterations.","Cognates: Sometimes a word pair differs by only one or two ending characters from a true transliteration. For example in the English/Russian training data, the Russian nouns are marked with cases whereas their English counterparts do not mark the case or translate it as a separate word. Often the Russian word differs only by the last character from a correct transliteration of the English word. Due to the large amount of such word pairs in the English/Russian data, our mining system learns to delete the final case marking characters from the Russian words. It assigns a high transliteration prob-Table 6: A few examples of English/Russian cognates ability to these word pairs and extracts them as transliterations. Table 6 shows some examples.","There are two English/Russian supervised systems which are better than our semi-supervised system. The Kahki et al. (2011) system is built on seed data only. Jiampojamarn et al. (2010)’s best system on English/Russian is based on the edit distance method. Both of these systems are focused on high precision. Our semi-supervised system is focused on high recall at the cost of lower precision.4","5.2 Transliteration Mining using Parallel Corpora The percentage of transliteration pairs in the NEWS10 datasets is high. We further check the effectiveness of our unsupervised and semi-supervised mining systems by evaluating them on parallel corpora with as few as 2% transliteration pairs.","We conduct experiments using two language pairs, English/Hindi and English/Arabic. The English/Hindi corpus is from the shared task on word alignment organized as part of the ACL 2005 Workshop on Building and Using Parallel Texts (WA05) (Martin et al., 2005). For English/Arabic, we use 200,000 parallel sentences from the United Nations (UN) corpus (Eisele and Chen, 2010). The English/Hindi and English/Arabic transliteration gold standards were provided by Sajjad et al. (2011). 5.2.1 Experiments","We follow the procedure for creating the training data described in Section 5.1.1 and build a word-aligned list and a cross-product list from the parallel corpus.

We define their probability as the inverse of the number of multigram tokens in the Viterbi alignment of the labelled and unlabelled data together. The close transliterations only differ by one or two characters from correct transliterations. We think these pairs provide transliteration information to the systems and help them to avoid problems with data sparseness. Our semi-supervised system uses the seed data to identify close transliterations as non-transliterations and decreases the number of false positives. They are reduced to 35 and 89 for English/Hindi and English/Arabic respectively. The seed data and the training data used in the semi-supervised system are from different domains (Wikipedia and UN). Seed data extracted from the same domain is likely to work better, resulting in even higher scores than we have reported."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["We presented a novel model to automatically mine transliteration pairs.
