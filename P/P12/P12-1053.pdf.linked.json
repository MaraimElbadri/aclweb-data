A good overview on TAG, their formal properties, their linguistic motivation, and their applications is presented by Joshi and Schabes (1992) and Joshi and Schabes (1997), in which also strong lexicalization is discussed. In general, lexicalization is the process of transforming a grammar into an equivalent one (potentially expressed in another formalism) such that each production contains a lexical item (or anchor). Each production can then be viewed as lexical information on its anchor. It demonstrates a syntactical construction in which the anchor can occur. Since a lexical item is a letter of the string","∗","Financially supported by the German Research Founda-tion (DFG) grant MA 4959 / 1-1. alphabet, each production of a lexicalized grammar produces at least one letter of the generated string. Consequently, lexicalized grammars offer significant parsing benefits (Schabes et al., 1988) as the number of applications of productions (i.e., derivation steps) is clearly bounded by the length of the input string. In addition, the lexical items in the productions guide the production selection in a derivation, which works especially well in scenarios with large alphabets.1","The GREIBACH normal form (Hopcroft et al., 2001; Blum and Koch, 1999) offers those benefits for context-free grammars [CFG], but it changes the parse trees. Thus, we distinguish between two notions of equivalence: Weak equivalence (Bar-Hillel et al., 1960) only requires that the generated string languages coincide, whereas strong equivalence (Chomsky, 1963) requires that even the generated tree languages coincide. Correspondingly, we obtain weak and strong lexicalization based on the required equivalence.","The GREIBACH normal form shows that CFG can weakly lexicalize themselves, but they cannot strongly lexicalize themselves (Schabes, 1990). It is a prominent feature of tree adjoining grammars that they can strongly lexicalize CFG (Schabes, 1990),2 and it was claimed and widely believed that they can strongly lexicalize themselves. Recently, Kuhlmann and Satta (2012) proved that TAG actually cannot strongly lexicalize themselves. In fact, they prove that TAG cannot even strongly lexicalize the weaker tree insertion grammars (Schabes and Waters, 1995). However, TAG can weakly lexicalize themselves (Fujiyoshi, 2005).","1","Chen (2001) presents a detailed account.","2","Good algorithmic properties and the good coverage of linguistic phenomena are other prominent features. 506","Simple (i.e., linear and nondeleting) context-free tree grammars [CFTG] (Rounds, 1969; Rounds, 1970) are a more powerful grammar formalism than TAG (Mönnich, 1997). However, the monadic variant is strongly equivalent to a slightly extended version of TAG, which is called non-strict TAG (Kepser and Rogers, 2011). A GREIBACH normal form for a superclass of CFTG (viz., second-order abstract categorial grammars) was discussed by Kanazawa and Yoshinaka (2005) and Yoshinaka (2006). In particular, they also demonstrate that monadic CFTG can strongly lexicalize regular tree grammars (Gécseg and Steinby, 1984; Gécseg and Steinby, 1997).","CFTG are weakly equivalent to the simple macro grammars of Fischer (1968), which are a notational variant of the well-nested linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRS) of Vijay-Shanker et al. (1987) and the well-nested multiple context-free grammars (MCFG) of Seki et al. (1991).3","Thus, CFTG are mildly context-sensitive since their generated string languages are semi-linear and can be parsed in polynomial time (Gómez-Rodrı́guez et al., 2010).","In this contribution, we show that CFTG can strongly lexicalize TAG and also themselves, thus answering the second question in the conclusion of Kuhlmann and Satta (2012). This is achieved by a series of normalization steps (see Section 4) and a final lexicalization step (see Section 5), in which a lexical item is guessed for each production that does not already contain one. This item is then transported in an additional argument until it is exchanged for the same item in a terminal production. The lexicalization is effective and increases the maximal rank (number of arguments) of the nonterminals by at most 1. In contrast to a transformation into GREIBACH normal form, our lexicalization does not radically change the structure of the derivations. Overall, our result shows that if we consider only lexicalization, then CFTG are a more natural generalization of CFG than TAG."]},{"title":"2 Notation","paragraphs":["We write [k] for the set {i ∈ N | 1 ≤ i ≤ k}, where N denotes the set of nonnegative integers.

The property ‘linear and nondeleting’ is often called ‘simple’. The nonterminals of regular tree grammars only occur at the leaves and are replaced using first-order substitution. In contrast, the nonterminals of a CFTG are ranked symbols, can occur anywhere in a tree, and are replaced using second-order substitution.6","Consequently, the nonterminals N of a CFTG form a ranked alphabet.

Moreover, it contains all the variables of Xk exactly once. Let us illustrate the syntax on an example CFTG. We use an abstract language for simplicity and clarity. We use lower-case Greek letters for terminal symbols and upper-case Latin letters for nonterminals.","Example 2.

This is slightly more general than necessary (for the semantics of G), but the presence of variables in sentential forms will be use-ful in the next section because it allows us to treat right-hand sides as sentential forms. In essence in a rewrite step we just select a nonterminal A ∈ N and an A-production ρ ∈ P .

In the given derivation of G we examine which nonterminals in the right-hand side of the instance of ρ′ were replaced using ρ. Let J be the set of positions corresponding to those nonterminals (thus p ∈ J ). Then instead of applying ρ′","and potentially several times ρ, we equivalently apply ρ′","J of G′","ρ.","In the next normalization step we use our production elimination scheme. The goal is to make sure that non-initial monic productions (i.e., productions of which the right-hand side contains at most one nonterminal) contain at least one lexical symbol. We define the relevant property and then present 510 the construction. A sentential form ξ ∈ SF(G) is monic if |posN (ξ)| ≤ 1. The set of all monic sentential forms is denoted by SF≤1(G). A production l → r is monic if r is monic. The next construction is similar to the simultaneous removal of epsilon-productions A → ε and unit productions A → B for context-free grammars (Hopcroft et al., 2001). Instead of computing the closure under those productions, we compute a closure under non-∆- lexicalized productions. Theorem 13. If G has finite ∆-ambiguity, then there exists an equivalent CFTG such that all its non-initial monic productions are ∆-lexicalized. Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that G is start-separated and growing by Theorem 7. Moreover, we assume that each nonterminal is use-ful. For every A ∈ N with A ̸= S, we compute all monic sentential forms without a lexical symbol that are reachable from A(x1, . . . , xk), where k = rk(A).

The set ΞA is finite since only finitely many non- ∆-lexicalized productions can be used due to the finite ∆-ambiguity of G. Moreover, no sentential form in ΞA contains A for the same reason and the fact that G is growing. We construct the CFTG G1 = (N, Σ, S, P ∪ P1) such that P1 = {A(x1, . . . , xk) → ξ | A ∈ Nk, ξ ∈ ΞA} . Clearly, G and G1 are equivalent. Next, we eliminate all productions of P1 from G1 using Lemma 12 to obtain an equivalent CFTG G2 with the productions P2. In the final step, we drop all non-∆- lexicalized monic productions of P2 to obtain the CFTG G, in which all monic productions are ∆- lexicalized. It is easy to see that G is growing, start-separated, and equivalent to G2.","The CFTG G′′","ex only has {α, β}-lexicalized non-","initial monic productions, so we use a new example.","Example 14.

Moreover, all its productions are monic, and Gex2 is finitely ∆-ambiguous for the set ∆ = {α} of lexical symbols. Then the productions (3) are non-initial and not ∆-lexicalized. So we can run the construction in the proof of Theorem 13. The relevant derivations using only non-∆-lexicalized productions are shown in Figure 5.

This is the reason why we made sure that we have two occurrences of lexical symbols in the terminal productions. After we exchanged one for a parameter, the resulting terminal production is still ∆-lexicalized. Lexical items that are guessed for distinct (occurrences of) productions are transported to distinct (occurrences of) terminal productions [cf.

We let N ′","= N × ∆ be a new set of nonterminals such that rk(⟨A, δ⟩) = rk(A) + 1 for every A ∈ N and δ ∈ ∆. Intuitively, ⟨A, δ⟩ represents the nonterminal A, which has the lexical symbol δ in its last (new) parameter. This parameter is handed to the (lexicographically) first nonterminal in the right-hand side until it is resolved in a terminal production. Formally, for each right-hand side r ∈ TN∪N′","∪Σ(X) such that posN (r) ̸= ∅ (i.e., it contains an original nonterminal), each k ∈ N, and each δ ∈ ∆, let rδ,k and rδ be such that rδ,k = r[⟨B, δ⟩(r1, . . . , rn, xk+1)]p rδ = r[⟨B, δ⟩(r1, . . . , rn, δ)]p , where p is the lexicographically smallest element of posN (r) and r|p = B(r1, . . . , rn) with B ∈ N and r1, . . . , rn ∈ TN∪N′","∪Σ(X). For each nonterminal A-production ρ = l → r in P let ρδ = ⟨A, δ⟩(x1, . . . , xk+1) → rδ,k , where k = rk(A). This construction is illustrated in Figure 6. Roughly speaking, we select the lexicographically smallest occurrence of a nonterminal in the right-hand side and pass the lexical symbol δ in the extra parameter to it. The extra parameter is used in terminal productions, so let ρ = l → r in P 512 S → σ α α ⟨S, α⟩ x1 → σ x1 α Figure 7: Original terminal production ρ from (1) [left] and the production ρ (see Theorem 17). be a terminal A-production. Then we define ρ = ⟨A, r(p)⟩(x1, . . . , xk+1) → r[xk+1]p , where p is the lexicographically smallest element of pos∆(r) and k = rk(A). This construction is illustrated in Figure 7. With these productions we obtain the CFTG G′","= (N ∪ N ′",", Σ, S, P ), where P = P ∪ P ′","∪ P ′′","and","P ′ = ⋃","ρ=l→r∈P l̸=S,posN (r)̸=∅","{ρδ | δ ∈ ∆} P ′′ = ⋃","ρ=l→r∈P l̸=S,posN (r)=∅ {ρ} . It is easy to prove that those new productions manage the desired transport of the extra parameter if it holds the value indicated in the nonterminal.","Finally, we replace each non-initial non-∆-lexicalized production in G′","by new productions that guess a lexical symbol and add it to the new parameter of the (lexicographically) first nonterminal ofN in the right-hand side. Formally, we let P nil = {l → r ∈ P | l ̸= S, pos∆(r) = ∅} P ′′′","= {l → r δ | l → r ∈ P nil, δ ∈ ∆} , of which P ′′′","is added to the productions. Note that each production l → r ∈ P nil contains at least one occurrence of a nonterminal of N (because all monic productions of G are ∆-lexicalized). Now all non-initial non-∆-lexicalized productions from P can be removed, so we obtain the CFTG G′′",", which is given by (N ∪ N ′",", Σ, S, R) with R = (P ∪ P ′′′",") \\ P","nil. It","can be verified thatG′′","is ∆-lexicalized and equiva-","lent to G (using the provided argumentation).","Instead of taking the lexicographically smallest element of posN (r) or pos∆(r) in the previous proof, we can take any fixed element of that set. In the definition of P ′","we can change posN (r) ̸= ∅ to |pos∆(r)| ≤ 1, and simultaneously in the definition of P ′′","change posN (r) = ∅ to |pos∆(r)| ≥ 2. With the latter changes the guessed lexical item is only transported until it is resolved in a production with at least two lexical items. Example 18. For the last time, we consider the CFTG G′′","ex of Example 8. We already illustrated the parts of the construction of Theorem 17 in Figures 6 and 7. The obtained {α, β}-lexicalized CFTG has the following 25 productions for all δ, δ′","∈ {α, β}: S′ → S S → A(δ, δ) | σ(δ, δ) | σ(α, β)","Sδ(x1) → Aδ(δ′",", δ′",", x1) | σ(x1, δ) Sα(x1) → σ(x1, β)","A(x1, x2) → Aδ(σ(x1, S), σ(x2, S), δ) (5)","Aδ(x1, x2, x3) → Aδ(σ(x1, Sδ′","(δ′",")), σ(x 2, S), x3)","A(x1, x2) → σ(σ(x1, Sδ(δ)), σ(x2, S))","Aδ(x1, x2, x3) → σ(σ(x1, Sδ(x3)), σ(x2, Sδ′","(δ′","))) , where Aδ = ⟨A, δ⟩ and Sδ = ⟨S, δ⟩.","If we change the lexicalization construction as indicated before this example, then all the productions Sδ(x1) → Aδ(δ′",", δ′",", x1) are replaced by the productions Sδ(x1) → A(x1, δ). Moreover, the productions (5) can be replaced by the productions A(x1, x2) → A(σ(x1, Sδ(δ)), σ(x2, S)), and then the nonterminals Aδ and their productions can be removed, which leaves only 15 productions."]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":["For k ∈ N, let CFTG(k) be the set of those CFTG whose nonterminals have rank at most k. Since the normal form constructions preserve the nonterminal rank, the proof of Theorem 17 shows that CFTG(k) are strongly lexicalized by CFTG(k+1). Kepser and Rogers (2011) show that non-strict TAG are strongly equivalent to CFTG(1). Hence, non-strict TAG are strongly lexicalized by CFTG(2).","It follows from Section 6 of Engelfriet et al. (1980) that the classes CFTG(k) with k ∈ N in-duce an infinite hierarchy of string languages, but it remains an open problem whether the rank increase in our lexicalization construction is necessary.","Gómez-Rodrı́guez et al. (2010) show that well-nested LCFRS of maximal fan-out k can be parsed in time O(n2k+2","), where n is the length of the input string w ∈ ∆∗",". From this result we conclude that CFTG(k) can be parsed in time O(n2k+4","), in the sense that we can produce a parse tree t that is generated by the CFTG with yd∆(t) = w. It is not clear yet whether lexicalized CFTG(k) can be parsed more efficiently in practice. 513"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Franz Baader and Tobias Nipkow. 1998.
