Joshi (1985) refers to MIX as representing “an extreme case of the degree of free word order permitted in a language”, which is “linguistically not relevant”. Gazdar (1988) adopts a similar position regarding the relation between MIX","1","If w is a string and d is a symbol, we write |w|d to mean the number of occurrences of d in w. We will use the notation |w| to denote the length of w, i.e., the total number of occurrences of symbols in w.","2","According to Gazdar (1988), “MIX was originally described by Emmon Bach and was so-dubbed by students in the 1983 Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics”. According to Bach (1988), the name MIX was “the happy in-vention of Bill Marsh”. and natural languages, noting that “it seems rather unlikely that any natural language will turn out to have a MIX-like characteristic”.","It therefore seems natural to assume that languages such as MIX should be excluded from any class of formal languages that purports to be a tight formal characterization of the possible natural languages. It was in this spirit that Joshi et al. (1991) suggested that MIX should not be in the class of so-called mildly context-sensitive languages: “[mildly context-sensitive grammars] capture only certain kinds of dependencies, e.g., nested dependencies and certain limited kinds of cross-serial dependencies (for example, in the subordinate clause constructions in Dutch or some variations of them, but perhaps not in the so-called MIX (or Bach) language) ....” Mild context-sensitivity is an informally defined notion first introduced by Joshi (1985); it consists of the three conditions of limited cross-serial dependencies, constant growth,andpolynomial parsing. The first condition is only vaguely formulated, but the other two conditions are clearly satisfied by tree-adjoining grammars. The suggestion of Joshi et al. (1991) was that MIX should be regarded as a violation of the condition of limited cross-serial dependencies.","Joshi (1985) conjectured rather strongly that MIX is not a tree-adjoining language: “TAGs cannot generate this language, although for TAGs the proof is not in hand yet”. An even stronger conjecture was made by Marsh (1985), namely, that MIX is not an 666 indexed language.3","(It is known that the indexed languages properly include the tree-adjoining languages.) Joshi et al. (1991), however, expressed a more pessimistic view about the conjecture: “It is not known whether TAG . . . can generate MIX. This has turned out to be averydifficult problem. In fact, it is not even known whether an IG [(indexed grammar)] can generate MIX.”","This open question has become all the more press-ing after a recent result by Salvati (2011). This result says that MIX is in the class of multiple context-free languages (Seki et al., 1991), or equivalently, languages of linear context-free rewriting systems (Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987; Weir, 1988), which has been customarily regarded as a formal counterpart of the informal notion of a mildly context-sensitive language.4","It means that either we have to abandon the identification of multiple context-free languages with mildly context-sensitive languages, or we should revise our conception of limited cross-serial dependencies and stop regarding MIX-like languages as violations of this condition. Surely, the resolution of Joshi’s (1985) conjecture should crucially affect the choice between these two alternatives.","In this paper, we prove that MIX is not a tree-adjoining language. Our proof is cast in terms of the formalism of head grammar (Pollard, 1984; Roach, 1987), which is known to be equivalent to TAG (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1994). The key to our proof is the notion of an n-decomposition of a string over {a,b,c}, which is similar to the notion of a derivation in head grammars, but independent of any particular grammar. The parameter n indicates how unbalanced the occurrence counts of the three let-ters can be at any point in a decomposition. We first","3","The relation of MIX with indexed languages is also of in-terest in combinatorial group theory. Gilman (2005) remarks that “it does not ...seem to be known whether or not the word problem of Z × Z is indexed”, alluding to the language O2 = { w ∈{a,ā,b,b̄}∗","||w|a = |w|ā,|w|b = |w| ̄","b }.SinceO2 and MIX are rationally equivalent, O2 is indexed if and only if MIX is indexed (Salvati, 2011).","4","Joshi et al.

Groenink (1997) wrote “The class of mildly context-sensitive languages seems to be most adequately approached by LCFRS.” show that if MIX is generated by some head grammar, then there is an n such that every string in MIX has an n-decomposition. We then prove that if every string in MIX has an n-decomposition, then every string in MIX must have a 2-decomposition. Finally, we exhibit a particular string in MIX that has no 2-decomposition. The length of this string is 87, and the fact that it has no 2-decomposition was first verified by a computer program accompanying this paper. We include here a rigorous, mathematical proof of this fact not relying on the computer verification."]},{"title":"2 Head Grammars","paragraphs":["A head grammar is a quadruple G = (N,Σ,P,S), where N is a finite set of nonterminals, Σis a finite set of terminal symbols (alphabet), S is a distinguished element of N,andP is a finite set of rules.

We can prove by straightforward induction on the height of derivation trees that whenever A(v1,v2) appears on a node in a derivation tree for B(w1,w2), then there exist z0,z1,z2,z3 that satisfy one of the following conditions:","(a) w1 = z0v1z1v2z2, w2 = z3,and⊢G A(u1,u2) implies ⊢G B(z0u1z1u2z2,z3).","(b) w1 = z0, w2 = z1v1z2v2z3,and⊢G A(u1,u2) implies ⊢G B(z0,z1u1z2u2z3). 668","(c) w1 = z0v1z1, w2 = z2v2z3,and⊢G A(u1,u2) implies ⊢G B(z0u1z1,z2u2z3).

In other words, ψis a homomorphism from the free monoid Σ∗","to Z × Z with addition as the monoid operation and (0,0) as identity. Lemma 2. Suppose that G = (N,Σ,P,S) is a head grammar without useless nonterminals such that L(G) ⊆MIX. There exists a function ΨG : N → Z × Z such that ⊢G A(u1,u2) implies ψ(u1u2) =ΨG(A). Proof. Since G has no useless nonterminals, for each nonterminal A of G, there is a derivation tree for some string in L(G)inwhichA appears in a node label. By Lemma 1, there are strings z0,z1,z2 such that ⊢G A(u1,u2) implies z0u1z1u2z2 ∈L(G). Since L(G) ⊆MIX, we have ψ(z0u1z1u2z2) = (0,0), and hence ψ(u1u2) = −ψ(z0z1z2). □ A decomposition of w ∈Σ∗","is a finite binary tree","satisfying the following conditions:","• the root is labeled by some (w1,w2) such that w = w1w2,","• each internal node whose left and right children are labeled by (u1,u2)and(v1,v2), respectively, is labeled by one of (u1u2v1,v2), (u1,u2v1v2), (u1v1,v2u2).","• each leaf node is labeled by some (s1,s2)such","that s1 s2 ∈{b,c}∗ ∪{a,c}∗","∪{a,b}∗",". Thus, the label of an internal node in a decomposition is obtained from the labels of its children by left concatenation, right concatenation, or wrapping. It is easy to see that if G is a head grammar over the alphabet Σ, any derivation for w ∈L(G) induces a decomposition of w. (Just strip offnonterminals.) Note that unlike with derivation trees, we have placed no bound on the length of a string that may appear on a leaf node of a decomposition. This will be convenient in some of the proofs below.","When p and q are integers, we write [p,q]forthe set { r ∈Z | p ≤r ≤q }. We call a decomposition of w an n-decomposition if each of its nodes is labeled by some (v1,v2) such that ψ(v1v2) ∈[−n,n]×[−n,n]. Lemma 3. If MIX = L(G) for some head grammar G = (Σ,N,P,S), then there exists an n such that each w ∈MIX has an n-decomposition. Proof. We may suppose without loss of generality that G has no useless nonterminal. Since MIX = L(G), there is a function ΨG satisfying the condition of Lemma 2. Since the set N of nonterminals of G is finite, there is an n such that ΨG(A) ∈[−n,n] × [−n,n]forallA ∈N.

Assume that each w ∈ MIX has an n-decomposition. Define a homomorphism γn : Σ∗","→ Σ∗","by","γn(a) = an",",","γn(b) = bn",",","γn(c) = cn",". 669 Clearly, γn is an injection, and we have ψ(γn(v)) = n · ψ(v)forallv ∈Σ∗",".","Let w ∈MIX with |w| = m.Thenw′","= γn(w) ∈ MIX and |w′","| = mn.

This is done recursively in an obvious way, start-ing from the root. If the root is labeled by (w1,w2), then it is assigned (0,|w1|,|w1|,|w1w2|). If a node is assigned a tuple (i,j,k,l) and has two children labeledby(u1,u2)and(v1,v2), respectively, then the 4-tuples assigned to the children are determined according to how (u1,u2)and(v1,v2) are combined at the parent node: u1 u2 v1 v2i j kl i + |u1| i + |u1u2| u1 u2 v1 v2i j kl k + |u2| k + |u2v1| u1 v1 v2 u2i j kl i + |u1| k + |v2|","Now define a function f :[0,mn] →{kn | 0 ≤ k ≤m } by f (i) =    i if n divides i,","n ·⌊i/n⌋ if n does not divide i and w′","[i − 1,i] ∈{a,b},","n ·⌈i/n⌉ if n does not divide i and w′","[i − 1,i] = c.","Clearly, f is weakly increasing in the sense that i ≤j","implies f (i) ≤f ( j).

If z = x1vx2 and ψ(v) ∈[−2,2] × [−2,2], then either v or x1 x2 is short. Proof. This is easy to see from the graphical representation in Figure 2. If a substring v of z has ψ(v) ∈[−2,2] × [−2,2], then the subcurve corresponding to v must have initial and final coordinates whose difference lies in [−2,2] × [−2,2]. If v contains all three letters, then it must contain as a substring at least one of ba19","c, ac29","b,andcb15","a. The only way to satisfy both these conditions is to have the subcurve corresponding to v start and end very close to the origin, so that x1 x2 is short.

Let us call a decomposition of a string concatenation-free if each of its non-leaf labels is the wrapping of the labels of the children. 671 Lemma 6. If z has a 2-decomposition, then z has a normal, concatenation-free 2-decomposition. Proof. Let D be a 2-decomposition of z. Without loss of generality, we may assume that D is normal. Suppose that D contains a node μ whose label is the left or right concatenation of the labels of its children, (u1,u2)and(v1,v2). We only consider the case of left concatenation since the case of right concatenation is entirely analogous; so we suppose that the node μ is labeled by (u1u2v1,v2). It follows that z = x1u1u2 x2 for some x1,x2,and by Lemma 5, either u1u2 or x1 x2 is short. If u1u2 is short, then the left child of μ is a leaf because D is normal. We can replace its label by (u1u2,ε); the label (u1u2v1,v2)ofμ will now be the wrapping (as well as left concatenation) of the two child labels, (u1u2,ε)and(v1,v2). If x1 x2 is short, then we can combine by wrapping a single node labeled by (x1,x2) with the subtree of D rooted at the left child of μ, to obtain a new 2-decomposition of z.Ineither case, the result is a normal 2-decomposition of z with fewer instances of concatenation. Repeat-ing this procedure, we eventually obtain a normal, concatenation-free 2-decomposition of z. □","Another useful property of the string z is the following: Lemma 7.

This implies that |u1u2|a ≤10. But since |u2|b = 15, we have |u1u2|b ≥ 15. This clearly contradicts ψ(u1u2) ∈[−2,2] × [−2,2]. □","We now assume that z has a normal, concatenation-free 2-decomposition D and derive a contradiction. We do this by following a certain path in D. Starting from the root, we descend in D, always choosing a non-leaf child, as long as there is one. We show that this path will never terminate.","The i-th node on the path will be denoted by μi, counting the root as the 0-th node. The label of μi will be denoted by (wi,1,wi,2). With each i, we associate three strings xi,1,yi,xi,2 such that xi,1wi,1yiwi,2 xi,2 = z, analogously to Lemma 1. Since ψ(wi,1wi,2) ∈[−2,2] × [−2,2] and ψ(z) = (0,0), we will always have ψ(xi,1yi xi,2) ∈[−2,2] × [−2,2].","Initially, (w0,1,w0,2) is the label of the root μ0 and x0,1 = y0 = x0,2 = ε.Ifμi is not a leaf node, let (ui,1,ui,2)and(vi,1,vi,2) be the labels of the left and right children of μi, respectively. If the left child is not a leaf node, we let μi+1 be the left child, in which case we have (wi+1,1,wi+1,2) = (ui,1,ui,2), xi+1,1 = xi,1, xi+1,2 = xi,2,andyi+1 = vi,1yvi,2.Otherwise, μi+1 will be the right child of μi,andwe have (wi+1,1,wi+1,2) = (vi,1,vi,2), xi+1,1 = xi,1ui,1, xi+1,2 = ui,2 xi,2,andyi+1 = yi.","The path μ0,μ1,μ2,...is naturally divided into two parts. The initial part of the path consists of nodes where xi,1yi xi,2 is short. Note that x0,1y0 x0,2 = εis short. As long as xi,1yi xi,2 is short, (wi,1,wi,2) must be long and μi has two children labeled by (ui,1,ui,2)and(vi,1,vi,2). By Lemma 7, either (ui,1,ui,2)or(vi,1,vi,2) must be short. Since the length 672 of z is 87 and the length of a short string is at most 6, exactly one of (ui,1,ui,2)and(vi,1,vi,2) must be long.","We must eventually enter the second part of the path, where xi,1yi xi,2 is no longer short. Let μm be the first node belonging to this part of the path. Note that at μm,wehaveψ(xm,1ym xm,2) = ψ(xm−1,1ym−1 xm−1,2) + ψ(v) for some short string v. (Namely, v = um−1,1um−1,2 or v = vm−1,1vm−1,2.) Lemma 8. If u and v are short strings and ψ(uv) ∈ [−2,2] × [−2,2],then|uv|d ≤4 for each d ∈{a,b,c}. Proof. Since u and v are short, we have |u|a ≤ 4,|u|b ≤4,|u|c ≤2and|v|a ≤4,|v|b ≤4,|v|c ≤2. It immediately follows that |uv|c ≤4. We distinguish two cases.","Case 1. |uv|c ≤2. Since ψ(uv) ∈[−2,2] × [−2,2], we must have |uv|a ≤4and|uv|b ≤4.","Case 2. |uv|c ≥3. Since |u|c ≤2and|v|c ≤2, we must have |u|c ≥1and|v|c ≥1. Also, ψ(uv) ∈ [−2,2] × [−2,2] implies that |uv|a ≥1and|uv|b ≥1. Since u and v are short, it follows that one of the following two conditions must hold: (i) |u|a ≥1,|u|b = 0and|v|a = 0,|v|b ≥1. (ii) |u|a = 0,|u|b ≥1and|v|a ≥1,|v|b = 0. In the former case, |uv|a = |u|a ≤4and|uv|b = |v|b ≤ 4. In the latter case, |uv|a = |v|a ≤ 4and|uv|b = |u|b ≤4. □","By Lemma 8, the number of occurrences of each letter in xm,1ym xm,2 is in [1,4]. This can only be if","xm,1xm,2 = a j ,","ym = ck bl",", for some j,k,l ∈[1,4]. This means that the string z must have been split into two strings (w0,1,w0,2)at the root of D somewhere in the vicinity of position 67 (see Figure 2). It immediately follows that for all i ≥m, wi,1 is a substring of a5","b14","a19","c28","and w","i,2 is a substring of","b14 a5",". We show by induction that for all i ≥m,the","following condition holds:","(†) ba19 c17","is a substring of w i,1. The condition (†) clearly holds for i = m.Nowassume (†). Then (wi,1,wi,2) is long, and μi has left and right children, labeled by (ui,1,ui,2)and(vi,1,vi,2), respectively, such that wi,1 = ui,1vi,1 and wi,2 = vi,2ui,2. We consider two cases.","Case 1. ui,1 contains c.Thenba19","c is a substring of ui,1.Sinceui,2 is a substring of b14","a5",", it cannot contain any occurrences of c.Sinceψ1(ui,1ui,2) ∈ [−2,2], it follows that ui,1 must contain at least 17 occurrences of c; hence ba19","c17","is a substring of ui,1. Since (ui,1,ui,2) is long, (wi+1,1,wi+1,2) = (ui,1,ui,2). Therefore, the condition (†) holds with i + 1inplace of i.","Case 2. ui,1 does not contain c.Then(ui,1,ui,2)is short and (wi+1,1,wi+1,2) = (vi,1,vi,2). Note that vi,1 must contain at least 17 occurrences of c,butvi,2 is a substring of b14","a5","and hence cannot contain more than 14 occurrences of b.Sinceψ2(vi,1vi,2) ∈[−2,2], it follows that vi,1 must contain at least one occurrence of b. Therefore, ba19","c17","must be a substring of vi,1 = wi+1,1, which shows that (†) holds with i + 1 in place of i.","We have proved that (†) holds for all i ≥m.Itfollows that for all i, μi has two children and hence μi+1 is defined. This means that the path μ0,μ1,μ2,... is infinite, contradicting the assumption that D is a 2-decomposition of z.","We have proved the following: Lemma 9. There is a string in MIX that has no 2-decomposition. Theorem 10. There is no head grammar G such that L(G) = MIX. Proof.
