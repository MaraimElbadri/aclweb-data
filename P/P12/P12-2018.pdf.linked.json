Manning Department of Computer Science Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305 {sidaw,manning}@stanford.edu Abstract","paragraphs":["Variants of Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are often used as baseline methods for text classification, but their performance varies greatly depending on the model variant, features used and task/ dataset. We show that: (i) the inclusion of word bigram features gives consistent gains on sentiment analysis tasks; (ii) for short snippet sentiment tasks, NB actually does better than SVMs (while for longer documents the opposite result holds); (iii) a simple but novel SVM variant using NB log-count ratios as feature values consistently performs well across tasks and datasets. Based on these observations, we identify simple NB and SVM variants which outperform most published results on sentiment analysis datasets, sometimes providing a new state-of-the-art performance level."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are often used as baselines for other methods in text categorization and sentiment analysis research. However, their performance varies significantly depending on which variant, features and datasets are used. We show that researchers have not paid sufficient attention to these model selec-tion issues. Indeed, we show that the better variants often outperform recently published state-of-the-art methods on many datasets. We attempt to categorize which method, which variants and which features perform better under which circumstances.","First, we make an important distinction between sentiment classification and topical text classification. We show that the usefulness of bigram features in bag of features sentiment classification has been underappreciated, perhaps because their usefulness is more of a mixed bag for topical text classification tasks. We then distinguish between short snippet sentiment tasks and longer reviews, showing that for the former, NB outperforms SVMs. Contrary to claims in the literature, we show that bag of features models are still strong performers on snippet sentiment classification tasks, with NB models generally outperforming the sophisticated, structure-sensitive models explored in recent work. Furthermore, by combining generative and discriminative classifiers, we present a simple model variant where an SVM is built over NB log-count ratios as feature values, and show that it is a strong and robust performer over all the presented tasks. Finally, we confirm the well-known result that MNB is normally better and more stable than multivariate Bernoulli NB, and the in-creasingly known result that binarized MNB is better than standard MNB. The code and datasets to reproduce the results in this paper are publicly available. 1"]},{"title":"2 The Methods","paragraphs":["We formulate our main model variants as linear clas-","sifiers, where the prediction for test casek is","y(k)","= sign(wT","x(k)","+ b) (1)","Details of the equivalent probabilistic formulations","are presented in (McCallum and Nigam, 1998).

The approximate upper-bounds on the difference required to be statistically significant at thep < 0.05 level are listed in table 1, column ∆. 4.2 MNB is better at snippets (Moilanen and Pulman, 2007) suggests that while “statistical methods” work well for datasets with hundreds of words in each example, they cannot handle snippets datasets and some rule-based system is necessary. Supporting this claim are examples such as not an inhumane monster6",", or killing cancer that express an overall positive sentiment with negative words.","Some previous work on classifying snippets in-clude using pre-defined polarity reversing rules (Moilanen and Pulman, 2007), and learning complex models on parse trees such as in (Nakagawa et al., 2010) and (Socher et al., 2011). These works seem promising as they perform better than many sophisticated, rule-based methods used as baselines in (Nakagawa et al., 2010). However, we find that several NB/SVM variants in fact do better than these state-of-the-art methods, even compared to methods that use lexicons, reversal rules, or unsupervised pretraining. The results are in table 2.","Our SVM-uni results are consistent with BoFnoDic and BoF-w/Rev used in (Nakagawa et al., 2010) and BoWSVM in (Pang and Lee, 2004).

While (Ng and Jordan, 2002) showed that NB is better than SVM/logistic regression (LR) with few training cases, we show that MNB is also better with short documents. In contrast to their result that an SVM usually beats NB when it has more than 30–50 training cases, we show that MNB is still better on snippets even with relatively large training sets (9k cases). 4.3 SVM is better at full-length reviews As seen in table 1, the RT-2k and IMDB datasets contain much longer reviews. Compared to the excellent performance of MNB on snippet datasets, the many poor assumptions of MNB pointed out in (Rennie et al., 2003) become more crippling for these longer documents. SVM is much stronger than MNB for the 2 full-length sentiment analysis tasks, but still worse than some other published results.

These sentiment analysis results are shown in table 3. 4.4 Benefits of bigrams depends on the task Word bigram features are not that commonly used in text classification tasks (hence, the usual term, “bag of words”), probably due to their having mixed and overall limited utility in topical text classification tasks, as seen in table 4. This likely reflects that certain topic keywords are indicative alone. However, in both tables 2 and 3, adding bigrams always improved the performance, and often gives better results than previously published.8","This presumably reflects that in sentiment classification there are","8","However, adding trigrams hurts slightly.

Therefore, NBSVM seems to be an appropriate and very strong baseline for sophisticated methods aiming to beat a bag of features.","One disadvantage of NBSVM is having the interpolation parameter β. The performance on longer documents is virtually identical (within 0.1%) for β ∈ [1⁄4, 1], while β = 1⁄4 is on average 0.5% better for snippets than β = 1. Using β ∈ [1⁄4, 1⁄2] makes the NBSVM more robust than more extreme values. 4.6 Other results Multivariate Bernoulli NB (BNB) usually performs worse than MNB. The only place where BNB is comparable to MNB is for snippet tasks using only unigrams. In general, BNB is less stable than MNB and performs up to 10% worse. Therefore, benchmarking against BNB is untrustworthy, cf. (McCallum and Nigam, 1998).","For MNB and NBSVM, using the binarized MNB f̂ is slightly better (by 1%) than using the raw count feature f . The difference is negligible for snippets.","Using logistic regression in place of SVM gives similar results, and some of our results can be viewed more generally in terms of generative vs. discriminative learning. 93"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["R.
