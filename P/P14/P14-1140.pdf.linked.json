With the efficient training methods, such as (Hinton et al., 2006), DNN is widely applied to speech and image processing, and has achieved breakthrough results (Kavukcuoglu et al., 2010; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Dahl et al., 2012).","Applying DNN to natural language processing (NLP), representation or embedding of words is usually learnt first. Word embedding is a dense, low dimensional, real-valued vector. Each dimension of the vector represents a latent aspect of the word, and captures its syntactic and semantic properties (Bengio et al., 2006). Word embedding is usually learnt from large amount of monolingual corpus at first, and then fine tuned for special distinct tasks. Collobert et al. (2011) propose a multi-task learning framework with DNN for various NLP tasks, including part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role labelling. Recurrent neural networks are leveraged to learn language model, and they keep the history information circularly inside the network for arbitrarily long time (Mikolov et al., 2010). Recursive neural networks, which have the ability to generate a tree structured output, are applied to natural language parsing (Socher et al., 2011), and they are extended to recursive neural tensor networks to explore the compositional aspect of semantics (Socher et al., 2013).","DNN is also introduced to Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) to learn several components or features of conventional framework, including word alignment, language modelling, translation modelling and distortion modelling. Yang et al. (2013) adapt and extend the CD-DNN-HMM (Dahl et al., 2012) method to HMM-based word alignment model. In their work, bilingual word embedding is trained to capture lexical translation information, and surrounding words are utilized to model context information. Auli et al. (2013) propose a joint language and translation model, based on a recurrent neural network. Their model predicts a target word, with an unbounded history of both source and target words. Liu et al. (2013) propose an additive neural network for SMT decoding. Word embedding is used as the input to learn translation confidence score, which is combined with commonly used features in the conventional log-linear model. For distortion modeling, Li et al. (2013) use recursive auto encoders to make full use of the entire merging phrase pairs, going beyond the boundary words with a maximum entropy classifier (Xiong et al., 2006). 1491","Different from the work mentioned above, which applies DNN to components of conventional SMT framework, in this paper, we propose a novel R2","NN to model the end-to-end decoding process. R2","NN is a combination of recursive neural network and recurrent neural network. In R2","NN, new information can be used to generate the next hidden state, like recurrent neural networks, and a tree structure can be built, as recursive neural networks. To generate the translation candidates in a commonly used bottom-up manner, recursive neural networks are naturally adopt-ed to build the tree structure. In recursive neural networks, all the representations of nodes are generated based on their child nodes, and it is difficult to integrate additional global information, such as language model and distortion model. In order to integrate these crucial information for better translation prediction, we combine recurrent neural networks into the recursive neural networks, so that we can use global information to generate the next hidden state, and select the better translation candidate.","We propose a three-step semi-supervised training approach to optimizing the parameters of R2","NN, which includes recursive auto-encoding for unsupervised pre-training, supervised local training based on the derivation trees of forced decoding, and supervised global training using early update strategy. So as to model the translation confidence for a translation phrase pair, we initialize the phrase pair embedding by leveraging the sparse features and recurrent neural network. The sparse features are phrase pairs in translation table, and recurrent neural network is utilized to learn a smoothed translation score with the source and target side information. We conduct experiments on a Chinese-to-English translation task to test our proposed methods, and we get about 1.5 BLEU points improvement, compared with a state-of-the-art baseline system.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces related work on applying DNN to SMT. Our R2","NN framework is introduced in detail in Section 3, followed by our three-step semi-supervised training approach in Section 4. Phrase pair embedding method using translation confidence is elaborated in Section 5. We introduce our conducted experiments in Section 6, and conclude our work in Section 7."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Yang et al. (2013) adapt and extend CD-DNN-HMM (Dahl et al., 2012) to word alignment. In their work, initial word embedding is firstly trained with a huge mono-lingual corpus, then the word embedding is adapted and fine tuned bilingually in a context-depended DNN HMM framework. Word embeddings capturing lexical translation information and surrounding words modeling context information are leveraged to improve the word alignment performance. Unfortunately, the better word alignment result generated by this model, cannot bring significant performance improvement on a end-to-end SMT evaluation task.","To improve the SMT performance directly, Auli et al. (2013) extend the recurrent neural network language model, in order to use both the source and target side information to scoring translation candidates. In their work, not only the target word embedding is used as the input of the network, but also the embedding of the source word, which is aligned to the current target word. To tackle the large search space due to the weak independence assumption, a lattice algorithm is proposed to rerank the n-best translation candidates, generated by a given SMT decoder.","Liu et al. (2013) propose an additive neural network for SMT decoding. RNNLM (Mikolov et al., 2010) is firstly used to generate the source and target word embeddings, which are fed into a one-hidden-layer neural network to get a translation confidence score. Together with other commonly used features, the translation confidence score is integrated into a conventional log-linear model. The parameters are optimized with development data set using mini-batch conjugate sub-gradient method and a regularized ranking loss.","DNN is also brought into the distortion modeling. Going beyond the previous work using boundary words for distortion modeling in BTG-based SMT decoder, Li et al. (2013) propose to apply recursive auto-encoder to make full use of the entire merged blocks. The recursive auto-encoder is trained with reordering examples extracted from word-aligned bilingual sentences. Given the representations of the smaller phrase pairs, recursive auto-encoder can generate the representation of the parent phrase pair with a re-ordering confidence score. The combination of reconstruction error and re-ordering error is used to be the objective function for the model training. 1492"]},{"title":"3 Our Model","paragraphs":["In this section, we leverage DNN to model the end-to-end SMT decoding process, using a novel recursive recurrent neural network (R2","NN), which is different from the above mentioned work applying DNN to components of conventional SMT framework. R2","NN is a combination of recursive neural network and recurrent neural network, which not only integrates the conventional global features as input information for each combination, but also generates the representation of the parent node for the future candidate generation.","In this section, we briefly recall the recurrent neural network and recursive neural network in Section 3.1 and 3.2, and then we elaborate our R2","NN in detail in Section 3.3. 3.1 Recurrent Neural Network Recurrent neural network is usually used for sequence processing, such as language model (Mikolov et al., 2010). Commonly used sequence processing methods, such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and n-gram language model, only use a limited history for the prediction. In HMM, the previous state is used as the history, and for n-gram language model (for example n equals to 3), the history is the previous two words. Recurrent neural network is proposed to use unbounded history information, and it has recurrent connections on hidden states, so that history information can be used circularly inside the network for arbitrarily long time. VU W ht−1 yt ht xt Figure 1: Recurrent neural network","As shown in Figure 1, the network contains three layers, an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer is a concatenation of ht−1 and xt, where ht−1 is a real-valued vector, which is the history information from time 0 to t − 1. xt is the embedding of the input word at time t . Word embedding xt is integrated with previous history ht−1 to generate the current hidden layer, which is a new history vector ht . Based on ht , we can predict the probability of the next word, which forms the output layer yt . The new history ht is used for the future prediction, and updated with new information from word embedding xt recurrently. 3.2 Recursive Neural Network In addition to the sequential structure above, tree structure is also usually constructed in various NLP tasks, such as parsing and SMT decoding. To generate a tree structure, recursive neural networks are introduced for natural language parsing (Socher et al., 2011). Similar with recurrent neural networks, recursive neural networks can also use unbounded history information from the sub-tree rooted at the current node. The commonly used binary recursive neural networks generate the representation of the parent node, with the representations of two child nodes as the input.","s[l,m] s[m,n] s[l,n] W y[l,n] Figure 2: Recursive neural network","As shown in Figure 2, s[l,m]","and s[m,n]","are the representations of the child nodes, and they are concatenated into one vector to be the input of the network. s[l,n]","is the generated representation of the parent node. y[l,n] is the confidence score of how plausible the parent node should be created. l, m, n are the indexes of the string. For example, for nature language parsing, s[l,n]","is the representation of the parent node, which could be a N P or V P node, and it is also the representation of the whole sub-tree covering from l to n . 3.3 Recursive Recurrent Neural Network Word embedding xt is integrated as new input information in recurrent neural networks for each prediction, but in recursive neural networks, no additional input information is used except the two representation vectors of the child nodes. However, some global information , which cannot be generated by the child representations, is crucial 1493 for SMT performance, such as language model score and distortion model score. So as to integrate such global information, and also keep the ability to generate tree structure, we combine the recurrent neural network and the recursive neural network to be a recursive recurrent neural network (R2","NN).","s[l,m] s[m,n] s[l,n]","x[l,m] x[m,n]W y[l,n]","V x[l,n] Figure 3: Recursive recurrent neural network As shown in Figure 3, based on the recursive network, we add three input vectors x[l,m]","for child node [l, m] , x[m,n]","for child node [m, n] , and x[l,n]","for parent node [l, n] . We call them recurrent input vectors, since they are borrowed from recurrent neural networks.

The main idea of auto encoding is to initialize the parameters of the neural network, by minimizing the information lost, which means, capturing as much information as possible in the hidden states from the input vector.","As shown in Figure 5, RAE contains two parts, an encoder with parameter W , and a decoder with parameter W ′",".

When RAE training is done, only the encoding model W will be fine tuned in the future training phases. 4.2 Supervised Local Training We use contrastive divergence method to fine tune the parameters W and V . The loss function is the commonly used ranking loss with a margin, and it is defined as follows:","LSLT (W, V, s[l,n] ) = max(0, 1 − y[l,n]","oracle + y [l,n] t ) (6) where s[l,n]","is the source span. y[l,n]","oracle is the plausible score of a oracle translation result. y [l,n] t is the plausible score for the best translation candidate given the model parameters W and V . The loss function aims to learn a model which assigns the good translation candidate (the oracle candidate) higher score than the bad ones, with a margin 1.","Translation candidates generated by forced decoding (Wuebker et al., 2010) are used as oracle translations, which are the positive samples. Forced decoding performs sentence pair segmen-tation using the same translation system as decoding. For each sentence pair in the training data, SMT decoder is applied to the source side, and any candidate which is not the partial sub-string of the target sentence is removed from the n-best list during decoding. From the forced decoding result, we can get the ideal derivation tree in the decoder’s search space, and extract positive/oracle translation candidates. 1495 4.3 Supervised Global Training The supervised local training uses the nodes/samples in the derivation tree of forced decoding to update the model, and the trained model tends to over-fit to local decisions. In this subsec-tion, a supervised global training is proposed to tune the model according to the final translation performance of the whole source sentence.","Actually, we can update the model from the root of the decoding tree and perform back propagation along the tree structure. Due to the inexac-t search nature of SMT decoding, search errors may inevitably break theoretical properties, and the final translation results may be not suitable for model training. To handle this problem, we use early update strategy for the supervised global training. Early update is testified to be useful for SMT training with large scale features (Yu et al., 2013). Instead of updating the model using the final translation results, early update approach optimizes the model, when the oracle translation candidate is pruned from the n-best list, meaning that, the model is updated once it performs a unrecoverable mistake. Back propagation is performed along the tree structure, and the phrase pair embeddings of the leaf nodess are updated.","The loss function for supervised global training is defined as follows:","LSGT (W, V, s[l,n] ) = − log(","∑ y[l,n] oracle exp (y [l,n] oracle)","∑ t∈nbest exp (y [l,n] t ) ) (7) where y","[l,n]","oracle is the model score of a oracle translation candidate for the span [l, n] . Oracle translation candidates are candidates get from forced decoding. If the span [l, n] is not the whole source sentence, there may be several oracle translation candidates, otherwise, there is only one, which is exactly the target sentence. There are much fewer training samples than those for supervised local training, and it is not suitable to use ranking loss for global training any longer. We use negative log-likelihood to penalize all the other translation candidates except the oracle ones, so as to leverage all the translation candidates as training samples."]},{"title":"5 Phrase Pair Embedding","paragraphs":["The next question is how to initialize the phrase pair embedding in the translation table, so as to generate the leaf nodes of the derivation tree. There are more phrase pairs than mono-lingual words, but bilingual corpus is much more difficult to acquire, compared with monolingual corpus.","Embedding #Data #Entry #Parameter Word 1G 500K 20 × 500K Word Pair 7M (500K)2","20 × (500K)2 Phrase Pair 7M (500K)4","20 × (500K)4 Table 1: The relationship between the size of training data and the number of model parameters. The numbers for word embedding is calculated on English Giga-Word corpus version 3. For word pair and phrase pair embedding, the numbers are calculated on IWSLT 2009 dialog training set. The word count of each side of phrase pairs is limited to be 2.","Table 1 shows the relationship between the size of training data and the number of model parameters. For word embedding, the training size is 1G bits, and we may have 500K terms. For each term, we have a vector with length 20 as parameters, so there are 20 × 500K parameters totally. But for source-target word pair, we may only have 7M bilingual corpus for training (taking IWSLT data set as an example), and there are 20 ×(500K)2 parameters to be tuned. For phrase pairs, the situation becomes even worse, especially when the limitation of word count in phrase pairs is relaxed. It is very difficult to learn the phrase pair embedding brute-forcedly as word embedding is learnt (Mikolov et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011), since we may not have enough training data.","A simple approach to construct phrase pair embedding is to use the average of the embeddings of the words in the phrase pair. One problem is that, word embedding may not be able to model the translation relationship between source and target phrases at phrase level, since some phrases cannot be decomposed. For example, the meaning of ”hot dog” is not the composition of the meanings of the words ”hot” and ”dog”. In this section, we split the phrase pair embedding into two parts to model the translation confidence directly: translation confidence with sparse features and translation confidence with recurrent neural network. We first get two translation confidence vectors separately using sparse features and recurrent neural network, and then concatenate them to be the phrase pair embedding. We call it translation confidence based phrase pair embedding (TCBPPE). 1496","5.1 Translation Confidence with Sparse Features Large scale feature training has drawn more attentions these years (Liang et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2013). Instead of integrating the sparse features directly into the log-linear model, we use them as the input to learn a phrase pair embedding. For the top 200,000 frequent translation pairs, each of them is a feature in itself, and a special feature is added for all the infrequent ones.","The one-hot representation vector is used as the input, and a one-hidden-layer network generates a confidence score. To train the neural network, we add the confidence scores to the conventional log-linear model as features. Forced decoding is utilized to get positive samples, and contrastive divergence is used for model training. The neural network is used to reduce the space dimension of sparse features, and the hidden layer of the network is used as the phrase pair embedding. The length of the hidden layer is empirically set to 20.","5.2 Translation Confidence with Recurrent Neural Network We Vhi−1 U p(ei) ei−1 Wf fa i hi Figure 6: Recurrent neural network for translation confidence","We use recurrent neural network to generate two smoothed translation confidence scores based on source and target word embeddings.
