He/she can spend hours trying to craft the message. Does it actually matter? While there has been extensive prior work looking into predicting popularity of social-media content, the effect of wording per se has rarely been studied since it is often confounded with the popularity of the author and the topic. To control for these confounding factors, we take advantage of the surprising fact that there are many pairs of tweets containing the same url and written by the same user but employing different wording. Given such pairs, we ask: which version attracts more retweets? This turns out to be a more difficult task than predicting popular topics. Still, humans can answer this question better than chance (but far from perfectly), and the computational methods we develop can do better than both an average human and a strong competing method trained on non-controlled data."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["How does one make a message “successful”? This question is of interest to many entities, including political parties trying to frame an issue (Chong and Druckman, 2007), and individuals attempting to make a point in a group meeting. In the first case, an important type of success is achieved if the national conversation adopts the rhetoric of the party; in the latter case, if other group members repeat the originating individual’s point.","The massive availability of online messages, such as posts to social media, now affords researchers new means to investigate at a very large scale the factors affecting message propagation, also known as adoption, sharing, spread, or virality. According to prior research, important features include characteristics of the originating author (e.g., verified Twitter user or not, author’s messages’ past success rate), the author’s social network (e.g., number of followers), message timing, and message content or topic (Artzi et al., 2012; Bakshy et al., 2011; Borghol et al., 2012; Guerini et al., 2011; Guerini et al., 2012; Hansen et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Lakkaraju et al., 2013; Milkman and Berger, 2012; Ma et al., 2012; Petrović et al., 2011; Romero et al., 2013; Suh et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2013; Tsur and Rappoport, 2012). Indeed, it’s not surprising that one of the most retweeted tweets of all time was from user BarackObama, with 40M followers, on November 6, 2012: “Four more years. [link to photo]”.","Our interest in this paper is the effect of alternative message wording, meaning how the message is said, rather than what the message is about. In contrast to the identity/social/timing/topic features mentioned above, wording is one of the few factors directly under an author’s control when he or she seeks to convey a fixed piece of content. For example, consider a speaker at the ACL business meeting who has been tasked with proposing that Paris be the next ACL location. This person cannot on the spot become ACL president, change the shape of his/her social network, wait until the next morning to speak, or campaign for Rome instead; but he/she can craft the message to be more humorous, more informative, emphasize certain as-pects instead of others, and so on. In other words, we investigate whether a different choice of words affects message propagation, controlling for user and topic: would user BarackObama have gotten significantly more (or fewer) retweets if he had used some alternate wording to announce his reelection? Although we cannot create a parallel universe 175 Table 1: Topic- and author-controlled (TAC) pairs.

Sign the petition [same URL] n2 = 13 in which BarackObama tweeted something else1",", fortunately, a surprising characteristic of Twitter allows us to run a fairly analogous natural experiment: external forces serendipitously provide an environment that resembles the desired controlled setting (DiNardo, 2008). Specifically, it turns out to be unexpectedly common for the same user to post different tweets regarding the same URL — a good proxy for fine-grained topic2","— within a relatively short period of time.3","Some example pairs are shown in Table 1; we see that the paired tweets may differ dramatically, going far beyond word-for-word substitutions, so that quite interesting changes can be studied.","Looking at these examples, can one in fact tell from the wording which tweet in a topic- and author-controlled pair will be more successful? The answer may not be a priori clear. For example, for the first pair in the table, one person we asked found t1’s invocation of a “scandal” to be more attention-grabbing; but another person preferred t2 because it is more informative about the URL’s content and includes “fight media portrayal”. In an Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) experiment (§4), we found that humans achieved an average accuracy of 61.3%: not that high, but better than chance, indicating that it is somewhat possible for humans to predict greater message spread from different deliveries of the same information.","Buoyed by the evidence of our AMT study that wording effects exist, we then performed a battery of experiments to seek generally-applicable, non-","1","Cf. the Music Lab “multiple universes” experiment to test the randomness of popularity (Salganik et al., 2006).","2","Although hashtags have been used as coarse-grained topic labels in prior work, for our purposes, we have no assurance that two tweets both using, say, “#Tahrir” would be attempting to express the same message but in different words. In contrast, see the same-URL examples in Table 1.","3","Moreover, Twitter presents tweets to a reader in strict chronological order, so that there are no algorithmic-ranking effects to compensate for in determining whether readers saw a tweet. And, Twitter accumulates retweet counts for the entire retweet cascade and displays them for the original tweet at the root of the propagation tree, so we can directly use Twitter’s retweet counts to compare the entire reach of the different versions. Twitter-specific features of more successful phrasings. §5.1 applies hypothesis testing (with Bonferroni correction to ameliorate issues with multiple comparisons) to investigate the utility of features like informativeness, resemblance to headlines, and conformity to the community norm in language use. §5.2 further validates our findings via prediction experiments, including on completely fresh held-out data, used only once and after an array of standard cross-validation experiments.4 We achieved 66.5% cross-validation accuracy and 65.6% held-out accuracy with a combination of our custom features and bag-of-words. Our classifier fared significantly better than a number of baselines, including a strong classifier trained on the most- and least-retweeted tweets that was even granted access to author and timing metadata."]},{"title":"2 Related work","paragraphs":["The idea of using carefully controlled experiments to study effective communication strategies dates back at least to Hovland et al. (1953). Recent studies range from examining what characteristics of New York Times articles correlate with high re-sharing rates (Milkman and Berger, 2012) to looking at how differences in description affect the spread of content-controlled videos or images (Borghol et al., 2012; Lakkaraju et al., 2013). Simmons et al. (2011) examined the variation of quotes from different sources to examine how textual memes mutate as people pass them along, but did not control for author. Predicting the “success” of various texts such as novels and movie quotes has been the aim of additional prior work not already mentioned in §1 (Ashok et al., 2013; Louis and Nenkova, 2013; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012; Pitler and Nenkova, 2008; McIntyre and Lapata, 2009). To our knowledge, there have been no large-scale studies exploring wording effects in a both topic- and author-controlled setting. Employing such controls, we find that predicting the more effective alternative wording is much harder than the previously well-studied problem of pre-4 And after crossing our fingers. 176 dicting popular content when author or topic can freely vary.","Related work regarding the features we considered is deferred to §5.1 (features description)."]},{"title":"3 Data","paragraphs":["Our main dataset was constructed by first gathering 1.77M topic- and author-controlled (henceforth TAC) tweet pairs5","differing in more than just spacing.6","We accomplished this by crawling time-lines of 236K user ids that appear in prior work (Kwak et al., 2010; Yang and Leskovec, 2011) via the Twitter API. This crawling process also yielded 632K TAC pairs whose only difference was spacing, and an additional 558M “unpaired” tweets; as shown later in this paper, we used these extra corpora for computing language models and other auxiliary information. We applied nonobvious but important filtering — described later in this section — to control for other external factors and to reduce ambiguous cases. This brought us to a set of 11,404 pairs, with the gold-standard labels determined by which tweet in each pair was the one that received more retweets according to the Twitter API. We then did a second crawl to get an additional 1,770 pairs to serve as a held-out dataset. The corresponding tweet IDs are available online at http://chenhaot.com/pages/ wording-for-propagation.html.

However, if we evaluate the accuracy of the majority response among the 39 judgments per pair, the number rises to 73%.

Be like the community, and be true to yourself (in the words you pick, but not necessarily in how you combine them).

(Table 7) We expect that provocative or sensationalistic tweets are likely to make people react. We found it difficult to model provocativeness directly. As a rough approximation, we check whether the changes in t2 with respect to t1 (which share the same topic and author) involve words or parts-of-speech that are associated with high retweet rate in a very large separate sample of unpaired tweets (retweets and replies discarded). Specifically, for each word w that appears more than 10 times, we compute the probability that tweets containing w are retweeted more than once, denoted by rspwq. We define the rt score of a tweet as maxwPT rspwq, where T is all the words in the tweet, and the rt score of a particular POS tag z in a tweet as maxwPT &tagpwq“zrspwq. Include positive and/or negative words. (Table 8) Prior work has found that including positive or negative sentiment increases message propagation (Milkman and Berger, 2012; Godes et al., 2005; Heath et al., 2001; Hansen et al., 2011). We measured the occurrence of positive and negative words as determined by the connotation lexicon of Feng et al. (2013) (better coverage than LIWC). Measuring the occurrence of both simultaneously was inspired by Riloff et al. (2013). Refer to other people (but not your audience).

(Table 10) DCKL’12 posited that movie quotes are more shared in the culture when they are general enough to be used in multiple contexts. We hence measured the presence of indefinite articles vs. definite articles. The easier to read, the better. (Table 11) We measure readability by using Flesch reading ease (Flesch, 1948) and Flesch-Kincaid grade level (Kincaid et al., 1975), though they are not designed for short texts. We use negative grade level so that a larger value indicates easier texts to read. Final question: Do authors prefer to do what is effective? Recall that we use binomial tests to determine author preference for applying a feature more in t2. Our preference statistics show that author preferences in many cases are aligned with feature efficacy. But there are several notable exceptions: for example, authors tend to increase the use of @-mentions and 2nd person pronouns even though they are ineffective. On the other hand, they did not increase the use of effective ones like proper nouns and numbers; nor did they tend to increase their rate of sentiment-bearing words. Bearing in mind that changes in t2 may not always be intended as an effort to improve t1, it is still interesting to observe that there are some contrasts between feature efficacy and author preferences. 5.2 Predicting the “better” wording","Here, we further examine the collective efficacy of the features introduced in §5.1 via their performance on a binary prediction task: given a TAC pair (t1, t2), did t2 receive more retweets? Our approach. We group the features introduced in §5.1 into 16 lexicon-based features (Table 3, 8, 9, 10), 9 informativeness features (Table 4), 6 language model features (Table 5, 6), 6 rt score features (Table 7), and 2 readability features (Table 11).

This yields 3,568 unigram features and 4,095 bigram features, for a total of 7,663 so-called 1,2-gram features. Values for each feature are normalized by linear transformation across all tweets in the training data to lie in the range r0, 1s.18","For a given TAC pair, we construct its feature vector as follows. For each feature being considered, we compute its normalized value for each tweet in the pair and take the difference as the feature value for this pair. We use L2-regularized logistic regression as our classifier, with parameters chosen by cross validation on the training data. (We also experimented with SVMs. The performance was very close, but mostly slightly lower.) A strong non-TAC alternative, with social information and timing thrown in. One baseline result we would like to establish is whether the topic and author controls we have argued for, while intuitively compelling for the purposes of trying to determine the best way for a given author to present some fixed content, are really necessary in practice. To test this, we consider an alternative binary L2-regularized logistic-regression classifier that is trained on unpaired data, specifically, on the collection of 10,000 most retweeted tweets (gold-standard label: positive) plus the 10,000 least retweeted tweets (gold-standard label: negative) that are neither retweets nor replies. Note that this alternative thus is granted, by design, roughly twice the training instances that our classifiers have, as a result of having roughly the same number of tweets, since our instances are pairs. Moreover, we additionally include the tweet author’s follower count, and the day and hour of posting, as features. We refer to this alternative classifier as ␣TAC+ff+time. (Mnemonic: “ff” is used in bibliographic contexts as an abbreviation 18 We also tried normalization by whitening, but it did not","lead to further improvements. 181 (a) Cross-validation and heldout accuracy for various feature sets.

In heldout validation, custom+1,2-gram is significantly better than␣TAC+ff+time (p=3.4e-12) and 1,2-gram (p=0.01) but not unigram (p=0.08), perhaps due to the small size of the heldout set. for “and the following”.) We apply it to a tweet pair by computing whether it gives a higher score to t2 or not. Baselines. To sanity-check whether our classifier provides any improvement over the simplest methods one could try, we also report the performance of the majority baseline, our request-for-sharing features, and our character-length feature. Performance comparison. We compare the accuracy (percentage of pairs whose labels were correctly predicted) of our approach against the competing methods. We report 5-fold cross validation results on our balanced set of 11,404 TAC pairs and on our completely disjoint heldout data19","of 1,770 TAC pairs; this set was never examined dur-ing development, and there are no authors in common between the two testing sets.","Figure 2(a) summarizes the main results. While ␣TAC+ff+time outperforms the majority baseline, using all the features we proposed beats ␣TAC+ff+time by more than 10% in both cross-validation (66.5% vs 55.9%) and heldout validation (65.6% vs 55.3%). We outperform the average human accuracy of 61% reported in our Amazon Mechanical Turk experiments (for a different data sample); ␣TAC+ff+time fails to do so.","The importance of topic and author control can be seen by further investigation of ␣TAC+ff+time’s performance. First, note that","19","To construct this data, we used the same criteria as in §3: written by authors with more than 5000 followers, posted within 12 hours, n2 ́n1 ě 10 or ď 1́5, and cosine similarity threshold value the same as in §3, cap of 50 on number of pairs from any individual author. it yields an accuracy of around 55% on our alternate-version-selection task,20","even though its cross-validation accuracy on the larger most- and least-retweeted unpaired tweets averages out to a high 98.8%. Furthermore, note the superior performance of unigrams trained on TAC data vs ␣TAC+ff+time — which is similar to our unigrams but trained on a larger but non-TAC dataset that included metadata. Thus, TAC pairs are a useful data source even for non-custom features. (We also include individual feature comparisons later.)","Informativeness is the best-performing custom feature group when run in isolation, and outperforms all baselines, as well as ␣TAC+ff+time; and we can see from Figure 2(a) that this is not due just to length. The combination of all our 39 custom features yields approximately 63% accuracy in both testing settings, significantly outperforming informativeness alone (pă0.001 in both cases). Again, this is higher than our estimate of average human performance.","Not surprisingly, the TAC-trained BOW features (unigram and 1,2-gram) show impressive predictive power in this task: many of our custom features can be captured by bag-of-word features, in a way. Still, the best performance is achieved","20","One might suspect that the problem is that ␣TAC+ff+time learns from its training data to over-rely on follower-count, since that is presumably a good feature for non-TAC tweets, and for this reason suffers when run on TAC data where follower-counts are by construction non-informative. But in fact, we found that removing the follower-count feature from ␣TAC+ff+time and re-training did not lead to improved performance. Hence, it seems that it is the non-controlled nature of the alternate training data that explains the drop in performance. 182 by combining our custom and 1,2-gram features together, to a degree statistically significantly better than using 1,2-gram features alone.","Finally, we remark on our Bonferroni correction. Recall that the intent of applying it is to avoid false positives. However, in our case, Figure 2(a) shows that our potentially “false” positives — features whose effectiveness did not pass the Bonferroni correction test — actually do raise performance in our prediction tests. Size of training data. Another interesting observation is how performance varies with data size. For n “ 1000, 2000, . . . , 10000, we randomly sampled n pairs from our 11,404 pairs, and computed the average cross-validation accuracy on the sampled data. Figure 2(b) shows the averages over 50 runs of the aforementioned procedure. Our custom features can achieve good performance with little data, in the sense that for sample size 1000, they outperform BOW features; on the other hand, BOW features quickly surpass them. Across the board, the custom+1,2-gram features are consistently better than the 1,2-gram features alone. Top features. Finally, we examine some of the top-weighted individual features from our approach and from the competing ␣TAC+ff+time classifier. The top three rows of Table 12 show the best custom and best and worst unigram features for our method; the bottom two rows show the best and worst unigrams for ␣TAC+ff+time. Among custom features, we see that community and personal language models, informativeness, retweet scores, sentiment, and generality are represented. As for unigram features, not surprisingly, “rt” and “retweet” are top features for both our approach and ␣TAC+ff+time. However, the other unigrams for the two methods seem to be a bit different in spirit. Some of the unigrams determined to be most poor only by our method appear to be both surprising and yet plausible in retrospect: “icymi” (abbreviation for “in case you missed it”) tends to indicate a direct repetition of older information, so people might prefer to retweet the earlier version; “thanks” and “sorry” could correspond to personal thank-yous and apologies not meant to be shared with a broader audience, and similarly @-mentioning another user may indicate a tweet intended only for that person. The appearance of [hashtag] in the best ␣TAC+ff+time unigrams is consistent with prior research in non-TAC settings (Suh et al., 2010; Petrović et al., 2011).

According to our hypothesis tests, help-ful wording heuristics include adding more information, making one’s language align with both community norms and with one’s prior messages, and mimicking news headlines. Readers may try out their own alternate phrasings at http: //chenhaot.com/retweetedmore/ to see what a simplified version of our classifier predicts.","In future work, it will be interesting to examine how these features generalize to longer and more extensive arguments. Moreover, understanding the underlying psychological and cultural mechanisms that establish the effectiveness of these features is a fundamental problem of interest. Acknowledgments. We thank C.
