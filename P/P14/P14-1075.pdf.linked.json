In the case of language models, we often have to remove low-frequency words because of a lack of computational resources, since the feature space of k-grams tends to be so large that we sometimes need cutoffs even in a distributed environment (Brants et al., 2007). In the case of topic models, the in-tuition is that low-frequency words do not make a large contribution to the statistics of the models. Actually, when we try to roughly analyze a corpus with topic models, a reduced corpus is enough for the purpose (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007).","A natural question arises: How many low-frequency words can we remove while maintain-ing sufficient performance? Or more generally, by how much can we reduce a corpus/model using a certain strategy and still keep a sufficient level of performance? There have been many stud-","∗","This work was mainly carried out while the author was with Toshiba Corporation. ies addressing the question as it pertains to different strategies (Stolcke, 1998; Buchsbaum et al., 1998; Goodman and Gao, 2000; Gao and Zhang, 2002; Ha et al., 2006; Hirsimaki, 2007; Church et al., 2007). Each of these studies experimentally discusses trade-off relationships between the size of the reduced corpus/model and its performance measured by perplexity, word error rate, and other factors. To our knowledge, however, there is no theoretical study on the question and no evidence for such a trade-off relationship, especially for topic models.","In this paper, we first address the question from a theoretical standpoint. We focus on the cutoff strategy for reducing a corpus, since a cutoff is simple but powerful method that is worth study-ing; as reported in (Goodman and Gao, 2000; Gao and Zhang, 2002), a cutoff is competitive with sophisticated strategies such as entropy prun-ing. As the basis of our theory, we assume Zipf’s law (Zipf, 1935), which is an empirical rule representing a long-tail property of words in a corpus. Our approach is essentially the same as those in physics, in the sense of constructing a theory while believing experimentally observed results. For example, we can derive the distance to the landing point of a ball thrown up in the air with initial speed v0 and angle θ as v02","sin(2θ)/g by believing in the experimentally observed gravity acceleration g. In a similar fashion, we will try to clarify the trade-off relationship by believing Zipf’s law.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define the notation and briefly explain Zipf’s law and perplexity. In Section 3, we theoretically derive the trade-off formulae of the cutoff for unigram models, k-gram models, and topic models, each of which represents its perplexity with respect to a reduced vocabulary, under the assumption that the corpus follows Zipf’s law. In addition, we show an approximate behavior of each formula under certain conditions. In 797 Section 4, we verify the correctness of our theory on synthetic corpora and examine the gap between theory and practice on several real corpora. Section 5 concludes the paper."]},{"title":"2 Preliminaries","paragraphs":["Let us consider a corpus w := w1 · · · wN of corpus size N and vocabulary size W . We use an abridged notation {w} := {w ∈ w} to represent the vocabulary of w. Clearly, N = |w| and W = |{w}| hold. When w has additional notations, N and W inherit them. For example, we will use N ′","as the size of w′","without its definition. 2.1 Power law and Zipf’s law A power law is a mathematical relationship between two quantities x and y, where y is proportional to the c-th power of x, i.e., y ∝ xc",", and c is a real number. Zipf’s law (Zipf, 1935) is a power law discovered on real corpora, wherein for any word w ∈ w in a corpus w, its frequency (or word count) f (w) is inversely proportional to its frequency ranking r(w), i.e., f (w) = C r(w) . Here, f (w) := |{w′","∈ w | w′","= w}|, and r(w) := |{w′","∈ w | f (w′",") ≥ f (w)}|. From the definition, the constant C is the maximum frequency in the corpus. Taking the natural logarithms ln(·) of both sides of the above equation, we find that its plot becomes linear on a log-log graph of r(w) and f (w). In fact, the result based on a statistical test in (Clauset et al., 2009) reports that the frequencies of words in a corpus completely follow a power law, whereas many datasets with long-tail properties, such as networks, actually do not follow power laws. 2.2 Perplexity Perplexity is a widely used evaluation measure of k-gram models and topic models. Let p be a predictive distribution over words, which was learned from a training corpus w based on a certain model. Formally, perplexity PP is defined as the geometric mean of the inverse of the per-word likelihood on the held-out test corpus wτ , i.e., PP := ( ∏ w∈wτ","1 p(w)",") 1 Nτ . Intuitively, PP means how many possibilities one has for estimating the next word in a test corpus. According to the definition, a lower perplexity means better generalization performance of p. Another well-known evaluation measure is cross-entropy. Since cross-entropy is easily calculated as log2 PP, we can apply many of the results of this paper to cross-entropy."]},{"title":"3 Perplexity on Reduced Corpora","paragraphs":["Now let us consider what a cutoff is. In our study, we simply define a corpus that has been reduced by removing low-frequency words from the original corpus with a certain threshold. Formally, we say w′","is a corpus reduced from the original corpus w, if w′","is the longest subsequence of w such that maxw′","∈w′ r(w′",") = W ′",". Note that a subsequence can include gaps in contrast to a substring. For example, supposing we have a corpus w = abcaba with a vocabulary {w} = {a, b, c}, w′ 1 = ababa is a reduced corpus, while w′ 2 = aba and w′","3 = acaa are not.","After learning a distribution p′","from a reduced corpus w′",", we need to infer the distribution p learned from the original corpus w. Here, we use constant restoring (defined below), which assumes the frequencies of the reduced low-frequency words are a constant.","Definition 1 (Constant Restoring). Given a pos-","itive constant λ, a distribution p′","over a reduced","corpus w′",", and a corpus w, we say that p̂ is","a λ-restored distribution of p′","from w′","to w, if∑ w∈{w} p̂(w) = 1, and for any w ∈ w, p̂(w) ∝ {","p′ (w) (w ∈ w′",")","λ (w /∈ w′",").","Constant restoring is similar to the additive smoothing defined by p̂(w) ∝ p′","(w) + λ, which is used to solve the zero-frequency problem of language models (Chen and Goodman, 1996). The only difference is the addition of a constant λ only to zero-frequency words. We think constant restoring is theoretically natural in our set-ting, since we can derive the above equation by letting each frequency of reduced words be λN ′ and defining a restored frequency function as follows: f̂ (w) = {","f (w) (w ∈ w′",")","λN ′ (w /∈ w′","). 798 Informally, constant restoring involves padding the vocabulary, while additive smoothing involves padding the corpus. Smoothing should be carried out after restoring. 3.1 Perplexity of Unigram Models Let us consider the perplexity of a unigram model learned from a reduced corpus. In unigram models, a predictive distribution p′","on a reduced corpus w′","can be simply calculated as p′","(w′",") = f (w′",")/N ′",". We shall start with an analysis of training-set perplexity, since we can derive an exact formula for it, which will give us a sufficient idea for making an approximate analysis of test-set perplexity. Let P̂P1 :=","(∏ w∈w 1 p̂(w) ) 1 N","be the perplexity of a λ-restored distribution p̂ on a unigram model. The next lemma gives the optimal restoring constant λ∗","minimizing P̂P1. Lemma 2. For any λ-restored distribution p̂ of a distribution p′","from a reduced corpus w′","to the original corpus w, its perplexity is minimized by","λ∗ = N − N ′ (W − W ′",")N ′ .","Proof. Let wR be the longest subsequence such","that minw′ ∈w′ r(w′",") = W ′","+ 1. Since wR is the","remainder of w′",", NR = N − N ′","and WR = W −","W ′","hold. After substituting the normalized form","of p̂ of Definition 1 into P̂P1, we have P̂P1 = ( ∏","w′ ∈w′ 1","p̂(w′",") ∏ wR∈wR","1 p̂(wR)",") 1 N = ( ∏","w′ ∈w′","1 + WRλ p′ (w′",") ∏ wR∈wR","1 + WRλ λ",") 1 N = 1 + WRλ λ N R N ( ∏","w′ ∈w′ 1","p′ (w′",")",") 1 N . We obtain the optimal smoothing factor λ∗","when ∂ ∂λ","P̂P1 ∝ ∂ ∂λ (1 + WRλ)/λ N R N","= 0. By using a similar argument to the one in the","above lemma, we can obtain the optimal constant","of additive smoothing as λ∗","≈ N−N′","W N′ , when N is sufficiently large.","The next theorem gives the exact formula of the training-set perplexity of a unigram model learned from a reduced corpus. Theorem 3. For any distribution p′","on a unigram model learned from a corpus w′","reduced from the original corpus w following Zipf ’s law, the perplexity P̂P1 of the λ∗","-restored distribution p̂ of p′ from w′","to w is calculated by","P̂P1(W ′ ) =H(W ) exp ( B(W ′",") H(W ) ) ( W − W ′","H(W ) − H(W ′",")",") 1− H(W′",") H(W) , where H(X) :=","∑X x=1 1 x and B(X) :=","∑X x=1 ln x x . Proof. We expand the first part of P̂P1 in the proof of Lemma 2 using λ∗","as follows: 1 + WRλ∗ λ∗ N R N =","( 1 + NR N ′ ) ( WRN ′ NR",") N R N = ( N N ′ ) (","(W − W ′",")N ′ N − N ′",") 1− N′ N . The second part of P̂P1 is as follows: ( ∏","w′ ∈w′ 1","p′ (w′",")",") 1 N = ∏","w′ ∈{w′","} ( 1","p′ (w′",")",") f(w′",") N = W ′ ∏ r=1 ( rN ′ C",") C rN = W ′ ∏ r=1 ( N ′ C",") C rN W ′","∏ r=1 r C rN = ( N ′ C",") N′ N exp ( C N W ′ ∑ r=1 ln r r ) . We obtain the objective formula by putting the above two formulae together with N = CH(W ) and N ′","= CH(W ′","), which are derived from Zipf’s law.","The functions H(X) and B(X) are the X-th partial sum of the harmonic series and Bertrand series (special form), respectively. An approximation by definite integrals yields H(X) ≈ ln X +γ, where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant, and B(X) ≈ 1","2 ln2","X. We may omit γ from the approximate analysis.","Now let us consider an approximate form of P̂P1(W ′",") in Theorem 3. For further discussion, 799","we define the last part of P̂P1(W ′ ) as follows:","F (W, W ′ ) := ( W − W ′","H(W ) − H(W ′",")",") 1− H(W′",") H(W) . Since W ′","= δW holds for an appropriate ratio δ, we have F (W, δW ) = (","W − δW H(W ) − H(δW )",") 1− H(δW) H(W) ≈ (","W − δW ln W − ln (δW )",") 1− ln (δW) ln W = (","W (1 − δ) − ln δ",") − ln δ ln W → 1 δ (W → ∞). Therefore, when W is sufficiently large, we can use F (W, W ′",") ≈ W","W ′ , since F (W, δW ) ≈ 1","δ holds for any ratio δ : 0 < δ < 1. Using this fact, we obtain an approximate formula P̃P1 of P̂P1 as follows:","P̃P1(W ′ ) = ln W exp ( ln2","W ′ 2 ln W ) W W ′ =","√ W ln W exp","(ln W ′","− ln W )2 2 ln W . The complexity of P̃P1 is quasi-polynomial,","i.e., P̃P1(W ′",") = O(W ′ln W ′","), which behaves as","a quadratic function on a log-log graph. Since","P̃P1(W ′",") is convex, i.e., ∂2","∂W ′2 P̃P1(W ′",") > 0, and its gradient ∂","∂W ′ P̃P1(W ′",") is zero when W ′","= W , we infer that low-frequency words may not largely contribute to the statistics. Considering the special case of W ′","= W , we obtain the perplexity PP1 of the unigram model learned from the original corpus w as PP1 = H(W ) exp ( B(W ) H(W ) ) ≈","√ W ln W. Interestingly, PP1 is approximately expressed as a simple elementary function of vocabulary size W . This suggests that models learned from corpora with the same vocabulary size theoretically have the same perplexity.","For the test-set perplexity, we assume that both the training corpus w and test corpus wτ are generated from the same distribution based on Zipf’s law. This assumption is natural, considering the situation of an in-domain test or cross validation","test. Let wτ ′ be the longest subsequence of wτ","such that for any w ∈ wτ ′",", w ∈ w′","holds. For-","mally, we assume p′","(w) ≈ p τ ′ (w) for any w ∈ w′","τ","when Wτ > W ′ , where p τ","′","is the true distribution over wτ ′",". Using similar arguments to those of Lemma 2 and Theorem 3 for wτ , we obtain an approximation formula for the test-set perplexity, where we simply substitute W and W ′","in the exact formula for the training-set perplexity with Wτ and Wτ ′",", respectively. For simplicity, we will only consider training-set perplexity from now on, since we can make a similar argument for the test-set perplexity in the later analysis. 3.2 Perplexity of k-gram Models Here, we will consider the perplexity of a k-gram model learned from a reduced corpus as a standard extension of a unigram model. Our theory only assumes that the corpus is generated on the basis of Zipf’s law. Thus, we can use a simple model where k-grams are calculated from a random word sequence based on Zipf’s law. This model seems to be stupid, since we can easily notice that the bigram “is is” is quite frequent, and the two bigrams “is a” and “a is” have the same frequency. However, the experiments described later uncovered the fact that the model can roughly capture the behavior of real corpora.","The frequency fk of k-gram word wk ∈ wk","in the model is represented by the following formula: fk(wk) =","Ck gk(rk(wk)) , where Ck is the maximal frequency in k-grams, rk is the frequency ranking of wk over k-grams, and gk expresses the frequency decay in k-grams. For example, the decay function g2 of bigrams is as follows: (g2(i))i := (g2(1), g2(2), g2(3), · · · ) = (1 · 1, 1 · 2, 2 · 1, 1 · 3, 3 · 1, · · · ) = (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, · · · ). This is an inverse of the sum of Piltz’s divisor functions d2(n) :=","∑","i1·i2=n 1, which represents","the number of divisors of an integer n (cf. (OEIS,","2001)). In general, we formally define gk through","its inverse: g−1","k (l) := Sk(l), where Sk(l) :=","∑l n=1 dk(n) and dk(n) :=","∑","i1·i2···ik=n 1. Since (gk(i))i is a sorted sequence of the elements of the k-th tensor power of vector (1, · · · , W ), we can calculate the maximum frequency Ck as follows. 800 Lemma 4. For any corpus w following Zipf ’s law, the maximum frequency of k-grams in our model is calculated by Ck =","N − (k − 1)D (H(W ))k , where D denotes the number of documents in w. Proof. We use","∑","wk fk(wk) = Ck(∑","w 1/r(w))k",".","The sum Sk(l) of Piltz’s divisor functions can be approximated by lPk(ln l), where Pk(x) is a polynomial of degree k − 1 with respect to x, and the main term of lPk(ln l) is given by the following residue Ress=1","ζk","(s)xs","s , where ζ(s) is","the Riemann zeta function (Li, 2005). Using this","fact, we obtain an approximation ln (g−1","k (l)) ≈","ln l + O(ln (ln l)) ≈ ln l, when l is sufficiently","large. Thus, when the corpus is sufficiently large,","we can see that the behavior of fk is roughly linear","on a log-log graph, i.e., fk(wk) ∝ rk(wk)−1",", since","if g−1 k (l) ∝ lc","holds, then fk(r) ∝ (gk(r))−1","∝ r− 1","c","holds.","Unfortunately, however, most corpora in the real world are not so large that the above-mentioned relation holds. Actually, Ha et al. (Ha et al., 2002; Ha et al., 2006) experimentally found that although a k-gram corpus roughly follows a power law even when k > 1, its exponent is smaller than 1 (for Zipf’s law). They pointed out that the exponent of bigrams is about 0.66, and that of 5-grams is about 0.59 in the Wall Street Journal corpus (WSJ87). Believing their claim that there exists a constant πk such that fk(wk) ∝ rk(wk)−πk",", we estimated the exponent of k-grams in an actual situation in the form of the following lemma. Lemma 5. Assuming that fk(wk) ∝ rk(wk)−πk holds for any k-gram word wk ∈ wk","in a corpus w following Zipf ’s law, the optimal exponent in our model based on the least squares criterion is calculated by πk =","ln W (k − 1) ln (ln W ) + ln W . Proof. We find the optimal exponent πk by minimizing the sum of squared errors between the gradients of g−1","k (r) and r 1 π k","on a log-log graph: ∫ { ∂ ∂y (y + ln Pk(y)) − ∂ ∂y ( 1 πk y )} 2 dy, where y = ln r.","In the case of unigrams (k = 1), the formula exactly represents Zipf’s law. In the case of k-grams (k > 1), we found that the formula approaches Zipf’s law when W approaches infinity, i.e., limW →∞ πk = 1.","Let us consider the perplexity of a k-gram model learned from a reduced corpus. We immediately obtain the following corollary using Lemma 5. Corollary 6. For any distribution p′","on a k-gram model learned from a corpus w′","reduced from the original corpus w following Zipf ’s law, assuming that fk(wk) ∝ rk(wk)−πk","holds for any k-gram word wk ∈ wk","and the optimal exponent π","k in","Lemma 5, the perplexity P̂Pk of the λ∗","-restored","distribution p̂ of p′","from w′","to w is calculated by","P̂Pk(W ′ ) =H πk (W ) exp ( Bπk (W ′",") Hπk (W ) ) ( W − W ′","Hπk (W ) − Hπk (W ′",")",") 1− Hπ k (W′",")","Hπ k (W) , where Ha(X) :=","∑X x=1 1 xa and Ba(X) :=","∑X x=1 a ln x xa .","Ha(X) is the X-th partial sum of the P-series or hyper-harmonic series, which is a generalization of the harmonic series H(X). Ba(X) is the X-th partial sum of the Bertrand series (another special form of B(X)). When 0 < a < 1, we can easily calculate P̂Pk(W ′",") by using the following approximations: Ha(X) ≈","(X + 1)1−a","− 1 1 − a Ba(X) ≈","a 1 − a","(X + 1)1−a ln(X + 1) −","a","(1 − a)2 (X + 1)1−a","+ a","(1 − a)2 . By putting the approximations of Ha(X) and","Ba(X) into the formula of Corollary 6, we ob-","tain an approximation P̂Pk(W ′",") ≈ O(W ′W ′1−π","k","). This implies that P̂Pk(W ′",") is approximately linear on a log-log graph, when πk is close to 1, i.e., k is relatively small and W is sufficiently large. Note that we must use the approximation of H(X), not Ha(X), when a = 1.","The fact that the frequency of k-grams follows a power law leads us to an additional convenient 801 property, since the process of generating a corpus in our theory can be treated as a variant of the coupon collector’s problem. In this problem, we consider how many trials are needed for collecting all coupons whose occurrence probabilities follow some stable distribution. According to a well-known result about power law distributions (Boneh and Papanicolaou, 1996), we need a corpus of size kW k","1−πk ln W when πk < 1, and W ln2","W when πk = 1 for collecting all of the k-grams, the number of which is W k",". Using results in (Atsonios et al., 2011), we can easily obtain a lower and upper bound of the actual vocabulary size W̃k of k-grams from the corpus size N and vocabulary size W as W̃k ≥ (πk + 1)","(","1 − e− (1−π k)N","Wk −1 −ln Wk","−1","Wk )","W̃k ≤ πk πk − 1 ( N","Hπk (W k",")",") 1 π k − N W 1−πk","(πk − 1)Hπk (W k",") . This means that we can determine the rough sparseness of k-grams and adjust some of the parameters such as the gram size k in learning statistical language models. 3.3 Perplexity of Topic Models In this section, we consider the perplexity of the widely used topic model, Latent Dirichlet Alloca-tion (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), by using the notation given in (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004). LDA is a probabilistic language model that generates a corpus as a mixture of hidden topics, and it allows us to infer two parameters: the document-topic distribution θ that represents the mixture rate of topics in each document, and the topic-word distribution φ that represents the occurrence rate of words in each topic. For a given corpus w, the model is defined as θdi ∼ Dirichlet(α) zi|θdi ∼ Multi(θdi) φzi ∼ Dirichlet(β) wi|zi, φzi ∼ Multi(φzi), where di and zi are respectively the document that includes the i-th word wi and the hidden topic that is assigned to wi. In the case of infer-ence by Gibbs sampling presented in (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004), we can sample a “good” topic as-signment zi for each word wi with high probability. Using the assignments z, we obtain the posterior distributions of two parameters as θ̂d(z) ∝ n(d) z + α and φ̂z(w) ∝ n(w)","z + β, where n (d) z and n(w) z respectively represent the number of times assigning topic z in document d and the number of times topic z is assigned to word w.","Since an exact analysis is very hard, we will place rough assumptions on φ̂ and θ̂ to reduce the complexity. The assumption placed on φ̂ is that the word distribution φ̂z of each topic z follows Zipf’s law. We think this is acceptable since we can regard each topic as a corpus that follows Zipf’s law. Since φ̂z is normalized for each topic, we can assume that for any two topics, z and z′",", and any two words, w and w′",", φ̂z(w) ≈ φ̂z′ (w′",") holds if rz(w) = rz′(w′","), where rz(w) is the frequency ranking of w with respect to n","(w)","z . Note that the above assumption pertains to a posterior, and we do not discuss the fact that a Pitman-Yor process prior is better suited for a power law (Goldwater et al., 2011).","The assumption placed on φ̂ may not be reasonable in the case of θ̂, because we can easily think of a document with only one topic, and we usually use a small number T of topics for LDA, e.g., T = 20. Thus, we consider two extreme cases. One is where each document evenly has all topics, and the other is where each document only has one topic. Although these two cases might be unrealistic, the actual (theoretical) perplexity is expected to be between their values. We believe that analyz-ing such extreme cases is theoretically important, since it would be useful for bounding the computational complexity and predictive performance.","We can regard the former case as a unigram model, since the marginal predictive distribution ∑T","z=1 θ̂d(z) φ̂z(w) ∝","∑T z=1 n(w) z +β T","∝∼ f (w) is in-dependent of d; here we have used θ̂d(z) = 1/T from the assumption. In the latter case, we can obtain an exact formula for the perplexity of LDA when the topic assigned to each document follows a discrete uniform distribution, as shown in the next theorem. Note that a mixture of corpora following Zipf’s law can be approximately regarded as following Zipf’s law, when W is sufficiently large. Theorem 7. For any distribution p′","on the LDA model with T topics learned from a corpus w′","reduced from the original corpus w following Zipf ’s law, assuming that each document only has one topic which is assigned based on a discrete uniform distribution, the perplexity P̂PMix of the λ∗","- restored distribution p̂ of p′","from w′","to w is calcu-802 Table 1: Details of Reuters, 20news, Enwiki, Zipf1, and ZipfMix.","vocab. size corpus size doc. size Reuters 70,258 2,754,800 18,118 20news 192,667 4,471,151 19,997 Enwiki 409,902 16,711,226 51,231 Zipf1 69,786 2,754,800 18,118 ZipfMix 70,093 2,754,800 18,118 lated by","P̂PMix(W ′ ) =H(W/T ) exp ( B(W ′","/T ) H(W/T ) ) ( W − W ′","H(W/T ) − H(W ′","/T )",") 1− H(W′","/T) H(W/T) Proof.

In fact, a similar argument to the one in the approximate analysis in Section 3.1 leads to an approximate formula P̃PMix of P̂PMix as","P̃PMix(W ′ ) = √ W T ln W T exp","(ln W ′","− ln W )2 2 ln (W/T ) , when W is sufficiently large.

Reuters and 20news here denote corpora extracted from the Reuters-21578 and 20 Newsgroups data sets, respectively. Enwiki is a 1/100 corpus of the English Wikipedia. Zipf1 is a synthetic corpus generated by Zipf’s law, whose corpus is the same size as Reuters, and ZipfMix is a mixture of 20 synthetic corpora, sizes are 1/20th of Reuters. We used ZipfMix only for the experiments on topic models. Table 1 lists the details of all five corpora.","Fig. 1(a) shows the word frequency of Reuters, 20news, Enwiki, and Zipf1 versus frequency ranking on a log-log graph. In all corpora, we can regard each curve as linear with a gradient close to 1. This means that all corpora roughly follow Zipf’s law. Furthermore, since the curve of Zipf1 is similar to that of Reuters, Zipf1 can be regarded as acceptable.","Fig. 1(b) plots the perplexity of unigram models learned from Reuters, 20news, Enwiki, and Zipf1 versus the size of reduced vocabulary on a log-log graph. Each value is the average over different test sets of five-fold cross validation. Theory1 is calculated using the formula in Theorem 3. The graph shows that the curve of Theory1 is nearly identical to that of Zipf1. Since the vocabulary size Wτ of each test set is small in this experiment, some errors appear when W ′","is large, i.e., Wτ < W ′",". This clearly means that our theory is theoretically correct for an ideal corpus Zipf1. Comparing Zipf1 with Reuters, however, we find that their perplexities are quite different. The reason is that the gap between the frequencies of low-ranking (high-frequency) words is considerably large. For example, the frequency of the 1st-rank word of Reuters is f (w) = 136, 371, while that of Zipf1 is f (w) = 234, 705. Our theory seems to be suited for inferring the growth rate of perplexity rather than the perplexity value itself.","As for the approximate formula P̃P1 of Theorem 3, we can surely regard the curve of Zipf1 as being roughly quadratic. The curves of real corpora also have a similar tendency, although their gradients are slightly steeper. This difference might have been caused by the above-mentioned errors. However, at least, we can ascertain the important fact that the results for the corpora reduced by 1/100 are not so different from those of the original corpora from the perspective of their perplexity measures.","Fig. 1(c) plots the frequency of k-grams (k ∈ {1, 2, 3}) in Reuters versus frequency ranking on a log-log graph. TheoryFreq (1-3) are calculated using Ck in Lemma 4 and πk in Lemma 5. A comparison of TheoryFreq and Zipf verifies the correctness of our theory. However, comparing Zipf and Reuters, we see that Ck is poorly estimated when the gram size is large, whereas πk is roughly correct. This may have happened because we did not put any assumptions on the word se-803","1","00","1","01","1","02 1 03","1","04","1","05","1","06","Frequency Ranking 1 00 1 01 1 02 1 03 1 04 1 05 1 06 1 07 Frequency Reuters 20news Enwiki Zipf1 (a) Frequency of unigrams","1","00","1","01","1","02 1 03","1","04","1","05","1","06","Reduced Vocabulary Size 1 03 1 04 1 05 Test-set Perplexity Reuters 20news Enwiki Zipf1 Theory1 (b) Perplexity of unigram models","1","00","1","01 1 02","1","03","1","04","1","05 Frequency Ranking 1 01 1 02 1 03 1 04 1 05 Frequency Reuters Zipf1 TheoryFreq1 Reuters2 Zipf2 TheoryFreq2 Reuters3 Zipf3 TheoryFreq3 (c) Frequency of k-grams","1","2","3","4 5 6","7","8","9","1","0","Gram Size 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 E x p o n e n t Reuters TheoryExp (d) Exponent of a power law over k-grams","1","00","1","01","1","02 1 03","1","04","1","05","1","06","1","07","Reduced Vocabulary Size 1 02 1 03 1 04 1 05 1 06 T e s t - s e t  P e r p l e x i t y Reuters Zipf1 Theory1 Reuters2 Zipf2 Theory2 Reuters3 Zipf3 Theory3 (e) Perplexity of k-gram models","1","00","1","01","1","02 1 03","1","04","1","05","1","06","Reduced Vocabulary Size 1 03 1 04 1 05 T e s t - s e t  P e r p l e x i t y Reuters 20news Enwiki Zipf1 Theory1 ZipfMix TheoryMix TheoryAve (f) Perplexity of topic models Figure 1: (a) Word frequency of Reuters, 20news, Enwiki, and Zipf1 versus frequency ranking.

We estimated each exponent of Reuters by using the least-squares method. TheoryGrad is calculated using πk in Lemma 5. Surprisingly, the real exponents of Reuters are almost the same as the theoretical estimate πk based on our “stupid” model that does not care about the order of words. Note that we do not use any information other than the vocabulary size W and the gram size k for estimating πk.","Fig. 1(e) plots the perplexity of k-gram models (k ∈ {1, 2, 3}) learned from Reuters versus the size of reduced vocabulary on a log-log graph. Theory2 and Theory3 are calculated using the formula in Corollary 6. In the case of bigrams, the perplexities of Theory2 are almost the same as that of Zipf2 when the size of reduced vocabulary is large. However, in the case of trigrams, the perplexities of Theory3 are far from those of Zipf3. This difference may be due to the sparseness of trigrams in Zipf3. To verify the correctness of our theory for higher order k-gram models, we need to make assumptions that include backoff and smoothing.","Fig. 1(f) plots the perplexity of LDA models with 20 topics learned from Reuters, 20news, Enwiki, Zipf1, and ZipfMix versus the size of reduced vocabulary on a log-log graph. We used a collapsed Gibbs sampler with 100 iterations to infer the parameters and set the hyper parameters, α = 0.1 and β = 0.1. In evaluating the perplexity, we estimated a posterior document-topic distribu-804 Table 2: Computational time and memory size for LDA learning on the original corpus, (1/10)- reduced corpus, and (1/20)-reduced corpus of Reuters. corpus time memory perplexity original 4m3.80s 71,548KB 500 (1/10) 3m55.70s 46,648KB 550 (1/20) 3m42.63s 34,024KB 611 tion θ̂d by using the first half of each test document and calculated the perplexity on the second half, as is done in (Asuncion et al., 2009). Each value is the average over different test sets of five-fold cross validation. Theory1 and TheoryMix are calculated using the formulae in Theorem 3 and Theorem 7, respectively. Comparing Zipf1 with Theory1, and ZipfMix with TheoryMix, we find that our theory of the extreme cases discussed in Section 3.3 is theoretically correct. TheoryAve is the average of Theory1 and TheoryMix. Comparing Reuters and TheoryAve, we see that their curves are almost the same. If theoretical perplexity P̂P has a similar tendency as real perplexity PP on a log-log graph, i.e., ln PP(W ′",") ≈ ln P̂P(W ′",") + c for some constant c, we can approximate its deterioration rate as PP(W ′",")/PP(W ) ≈ exp (ln P̂P(W ′",") + c)/ exp (ln P̂P(W ) + c) = P̂P(W ′",")/ P̂P(W ). Therefore, we can use TheoryAve as a heuristic function for estimating the perplexity of topic models. Since we can calculate an inverse of TheoryAve from the bisection or Newton-Raphson method, we can maximize the reduction rate and ensure an acceptable perplexity based on a user-specified deterioration rate. According to the fact that the three real corpora with different sizes have a similar tendency, it is expected that we can use our theory for a larger corpus.","Finally, let us examine the computational costs for LDA learning. Table 2 shows computational time and memory size for LDA learning on the original corpus, (1/10)-reduced corpus, and (1/20)-reduced corpus of Reuters. Comparing the memory used in the learning with the original corpus and with the (1/10)-reduced corpus of Reuters, we find that the learning on the (1/10)- reduced corpus used 60% of the memory used by the learning on the original corpus. While the computational time decreased a little, we believe that reducing the memory size helps to reduce computational time for a larger corpus in the sense that it can relax the constraint for in-memory computing. Although we did not examine the accuracy of real tasks in this paper, there is an interesting report that the word error rate of language models follows a power law with respect to perplexity (Klakow and Peters, 2002). Thus, we conjecture that the word error rate also has a similar tendency as perplexity with respect to the reduced vocabulary size."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We studied the relationship between perplexity and vocabulary size of reduced corpora. We derived trade-off formulae for the perplexity of k-gram models and topic models with respect to the size of reduced vocabulary and showed that each formula approximately has a simple behavior on a log-log graph under certain conditions. We verified the correctness of our theory on synthetic corpora and examined the gap between theory and practice on real corpora. We found that the estimation of the perplexity growth rate is reasonable. This means that we can maximize the reduction rate, thereby ensuring an acceptable perplexity based on a user-specified deterioration rate. Furthermore, this suggests the possibility that we can theoretically derive empirical parameters, or “rules of thumb”, for different NLP problems, assuming that a corpus follows Zipf’s law. We believe that our theoretical estimation has the advantages of computational efficiency and scalability especially for very large corpora, although experimental estimations such as cross-validation may be more accurate.","In the future, we want to find out the cause of the gap between theory and practice and extend our theory to bridge the gap, in the same way that we can construct equations of motion with air resistance in the example of the landing point of a ball in Section 1. For example, promising research directions include using a general law such as the Zipf-Mandelbrot law (Mandelbrot, 1965), a sophisticated model that cares the order of words such as hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes (Wood et al., 2011), and smoothing/backoff methods to handle the sparseness problem."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The author would like to thank the reviewers for their helpful comments. 805"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Arthur Asuncion, Max Welling, Padhraic Smyth, and Yee Whye Teh. 2009.
