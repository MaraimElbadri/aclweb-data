To date, CCG remains the most competitive formalism for recovering “deep” dependencies arising from many linguistic phenomena such as raising, control, extraction and coordination (Rimell et al., 2009; Nivre et al., 2010).","To achieve its expressiveness, CCG exhibits so-called “spurious” ambiguity, permitting many non-standard surface derivations which ease the recovery of certain dependencies, especially those arising from type-raising and composition. But this raises the question of what is the most suit-able model for CCG: should we model the derivations, the dependencies, or both? The choice for some existing parsers (Hockenmaier, 2003; Clark and Curran, 2007) is to model derivations directly, restricting the gold-standard to be the normal-form derivations (Eisner, 1996) from CCGBank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007).","Modelling dependencies, as a proxy for the semantic interpretation, fits well with the theory of CCG, in which Steedman (2000) argues that the derivation is merely a “trace” of the underlying syntactic process, and that the structure which is built, and predicated over when applying constraints on grammaticality, is the semantic interpretation. The early dependency model of Clark et al. (2002), in which model features were defined over only dependency structures, was partly motivated by these theoretical observations.","More generally, dependency models are desirable for a number of reasons. First, modelling dependencies provides an elegant solution to the spurious ambiguity problem (Clark and Curran, 2007). Second, obtaining training data for dependencies is likely to be easier than for syntactic derivations, especially for incomplete data (Schneider et al., 2013). Clark and Curran (2006) show how the dependency model from Clark and Curran (2007) extends naturally to the partial-training case, and also how to obtain dependency data cheaply from gold-standard lexical category sequences alone. And third, it has been argued that dependencies are an ideal representation for parser evaluation, especially for CCG (Briscoe and Carroll, 2006; Clark and Hockenmaier, 2002), and so optimizing for dependency recovery makes sense from an evaluation perspective.","In this paper, we fill a gap in the literature by developing the first dependency model for a shift-reduce CCG parser. Shift-reduce parsing applies naturally to CCG (Zhang and Clark, 2011), and the left-to-right, incremental nature of the decoding fits with CCG’s cognitive claims. The discrimina-tive model is global and trained with the structured perceptron. The decoder is based on beam-search 218 (Zhang and Clark, 2008) with the advantage of linear-time decoding (Goldberg et al., 2013).","A main contribution of the paper is a novel technique for training the parser using a dependency oracle, in which all derivations are hidden. A challenge arises from the potentially exponential number of derivations leading to a gold-standard dependency structure, which the oracle needs to keep track of. Our solution is an integration of a packed parse forest, which efficiently stores all the derivations, with the beam-search decoder at training time. The derivations are not explicitly part of the data, since the forest is built from the gold-standard dependencies. We also show how perceptron learning with beam-search (Collins and Roark, 2004) can be extended to handle the additional ambiguity, by adapting the “violation-fixing” perceptron of Huang et al. (2012).","Results on the standard CCGBank tests show that our parser achieves absolute labeled F-score gains of up to 0.5 over the shift-reduce parser of Zhang and Clark (2011); and up to 1.05 and 0.64 over the normal-form and hybrid models of Clark and Curran (2007), respectively."]},{"title":"2 Shift-Reduce with Beam-Search","paragraphs":["This section describes how shift-reduce techniques can be applied to CCG, following Zhang and Clark (2011). First we describe the deterministic process which a parser would follow when tracing out a single, correct derivation; then we describe how a model of normal-form derivations — or, more accurately, a sequence of shift-reduce actions leading to a normal-form derivation — can be used with beam-search to develop a non-deterministic parser which selects the highest scoring sequence of actions. Note this section only describes a normal-form derivation model for shift-reduce parsing. Section 3 explains how we extend the approach to dependency models.","The shift-reduce algorithm adapted to CCG is similar to that of shift-reduce dependency parsing (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre and Mc-Donald, 2008; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Huang and Sagae, 2010). Following Zhang and Clark (2011), we define each item in the parser as a pair ⟨s, q⟩, where q is a queue of remaining input, consisting of words and a set of possible lexical categories for each word (with q0 being the front word), and s is the stack that holds subtrees s0, s1, ...

SHIFT, REDUCE and UNARY are the three types of actions that can be applied to an item. A SHIFT action shifts one of the lexical categories of q0 onto the stack. A REDUCE action combines s0 and s1 according to a CCG combinatory rule, producing a new category on the top of the stack. A UNARY action applies either a type-raising or type-changing rule to the stack-top category s0.1","Figure 1 shows a deterministic example for the sentence Mr. President visited Paris, giving a single sequence of shift-reduce actions which produces a correct derivation (i.e. one producing the correct set of dependencies). Starting with the initial item ⟨s, q⟩0 (row 0), which has an empty stack and a full queue, a total of nine actions are applied to produce the complete derivation.","Applying beam-search to a statistical shift-reduce parser is a straightforward extension to the deterministic example. At each step, a beam is used to store the top-k highest-scoring items, resulting from expanding all items in the previous beam. An item becomes a candidate output once it has an empty queue, and the parser keeps track of the highest scored candidate output and returns the best one as the final output. Compared with greedy local-search (Nivre and Scholz, 2004), the use of a beam allows the parser to explore a larger search space and delay difficult ambiguity-resolving decisions by considering multiple items in parallel.","We refer to the shift-reduce model of Zhang and Clark (2011) as the normal-form model, where the oracle for each sentence specifies a unique sequence of gold-standard actions which produces the corresponding normal-form derivation. No dependency structures are involved at training and test time, except for evaluation. In the next section, we describe a dependency oracle which considers all sequences of actions producing a gold-standard dependency structure to be correct. 1 See Hockenmaier (2003) and Clark and Curran (2007)","for a description of CCG rules. 219","Mr. President visited Paris","N /N N (S [dcl]\\NP)/NP NP","> > N S [dcl]\\NP",">TC NP < S [dcl] (a) Mr. President visited Paris N /N N (S [dcl]\\NP)/NP NP","> N >TC NP",">T S [dcl]/(S [dcl]\\NP) >B S [dcl]/NP > S [dcl] (b) Figure 2: Two derivations leading to the same dependency structure.

Each complex category in the lexicon defines one or more predicate-argument relations, which can be realized as a predicate-argument dependency when the corresponding argument slot is consumed. For example, the transitive verb category above defines two relations: one for the subject NP and one for the object NP . In this paper a CCG predicate-argument dependency is a 4-tuple: ⟨hf , f, s, ha⟩ where hf is the lexical item of the lexical category expressing the relation; f is the lexical category; s is the argument slot; and ha is the head word of the argument. Since the lexical items in a dependency are indexed by their sentence positions, all dependencies for a sentence form a set, which is referred to as a CCG dependency structure. Clark and Curran (2007) contains a detailed description of dependency structures.","Fig. 2 shows an example demonstrating spurious ambiguity in relation to a CCG dependency structure. In both derivations, the first two lexical categories are combined using forward application (>) and the following dependency is realized: ⟨Mr., N /N1 , 1, President⟩. In the normal-form derivation (a), the dependency ⟨visited, (S \\NP1 )/NP2 , 2, Paris⟩ is created by combining the transitive verb category with the object NP using forward application. One final dependency, ⟨visited, (S \\NP1 )/NP2 , 1, President⟩, is realized when the root node S [dcl ] is produced through backward application (<).","Fig. 2(b) shows a non-normal-form derivation which uses type-raising (T) and composition (B) (which are not required to derive the correct dependency structure). In this alternative derivation, the dependency ⟨visited, (S \\NP1 )/NP2 , 1, President⟩ is realized using forward composition (B), and ⟨visited, (S \\NP1 )/NP2 , 2, Paris⟩ is realized when the S [dcl ] root is produced.","The chart-based dependency model of Clark and Curran (2007) treats all derivations as hidden, and defines a probabilistic model for a dependency structure by summing probabilities of all derivations leading to a particular structure. Features are defined over both derivations and CCG predicate-argument dependencies. We follow a similar approach, but rather than define a probabilistic model (which requires summing), we define a linear model over sequences of shift-reduce actions, as for the normal-form shift-reduce model. However, the difference compared to the normal-form model is that we do not assume a single gold-standard sequence of actions.","Similar to Goldberg and Nivre (2012), we define an oracle which determines, for a gold-standard dependency structure, G, what the valid transition sequences are (i.e. those sequences corresponding to derivations leading to G). More specifically, the oracle can determine, given G and an item ⟨s, q⟩, what the valid actions are for that item (i.e. what actions can potentially lead to G, starting with ⟨s, q⟩ and the dependencies already built on s). However, there can be exponentially many valid action sequences for G, which we represent efficiently using a packed parse forest. We show how the forest can be used, during beam-search decoding, to determine the valid actions for a parse item (Section 3.2). We also show, in Section 3.3, how perceptron training with early-update (Collins and Roark, 2004) can be used in this setting. 3.1 The Oracle Forest A CCG parse forest efficiently represents an exponential number of derivations. Following Clark and Curran (2007) (which builds on Miyao and Tsujii (2002)), and using the same notation, we define a CCG parse forest Φ as a tuple ⟨C, D, R, γ, δ⟩, where C is a set of conjunctive 220 Algorithm 1 (Clark and Curran, 2007)","Input: A packed forest ⟨C, D, R, γ, δ⟩, with dmax(c)","and dmax(d) already computed 1: function MAIN 2: for each dr ∈ R s.t. dmax.

Disjunctive nodes are equivalence classes of conjunctive nodes. Two conjunctive nodes are equivalent iff they have the same category, head and un-filled dependencies (i.e. they will lead to the same derivation, and produce the same dependencies, in any future parsing). R ⊆ D is a set of root disjunctive nodes. γ : D → 2C","is the conjunctive child function and δ : C → 2D","is the disjunctive child function. The former returns the set of all conjunctive nodes of a disjunctive node, and the latter returns the disjunctive child nodes of a conjunctive node.","The dependency model requires all the conjunctive and disjunctive nodes of Φ that are part of the derivations leading to a gold-standard dependency structure G. We refer to such derivations as correct derivations and the packed forest containing all these derivations as the oracle forest, denoted as ΦG, which is a subset of Φ. It is prohibitive to enumerate all correct derivations, but it is possible to identify, from Φ, all the conjunctive and disjunctive nodes that are part of ΦG. Clark and Curran (2007) gives an algorithm for doing so, which we use here. The main intuition behind the algorithm is that a gold-standard dependency structure decomposes over derivations; thus gold-standard dependencies realized at conjunctive nodes can be counted when Φ is built, and all nodes that are part of ΦG can then be marked out of Φ by traversing it top-down. A key idea in understanding the algo-","2","Under the hypergraph framework (Gallo et al., 1993; Huang and Chiang, 2005), a conjunctive node corresponds to a hyperedge and a disjunctive node corresponds to the head of a hyperedge or hyperedge bundle. rithm is that dependencies are created when disjunctive nodes are combined, and hence are associated with, or “live on”, conjunctive nodes in the forest.","Following Clark and Curran (2007), we also define the following three values, where the first decomposes only over local rule productions, while the other two decompose over derivations: cdeps(c) = { ∗ if ∃ τ ∈ deps(c), τ /∈ G |deps(c)| otherwise dmax(c) =    ∗ if cdeps(c) == ∗ ∗ if dmax(d) == ∗ for some d ∈ δ(c) ∑ d∈δ(c) dmax(d) + cdeps(c) otherwise dmax(d) = max{dmax(c) | c ∈ γ(d)}","deps(c) is the set of all dependencies on conjunctive node c, and cdeps(c) counts the number of correct dependencies on c. dmax(c) is the maximum number of correct dependencies over any sub-derivation headed by c and is calculated re-cursively; dmax(d) returns the same value for a disjunctive node. In all cases, a special value ∗ indicates the presence of incorrect dependencies. To obtain the oracle forest, we first pre-compute dmax(c) and dmax(d) for all d and c in Φ when Φ is built using CKY, which are then used by Algorithm 1 to identify all the conjunctive and disjunctive nodes in ΦG. 3.2 The Dependency Oracle Algorithm We observe that the canonical shift-reduce algorithm (as demonstrated in Fig. 1) applied to a single parse tree exactly resembles bottom-up post-order traversal of that tree. As an example, consider the derivation in Fig. 2a, where the corresponding sequence of actions is: sh N /N , sh N , re N , un NP , sh (S [dcl ]\\NP )/NP , sh NP , re S [dcl ]\\NP , re S [dcl ].3","The order of traversal is left-child, right-child and parent. For a single parse, the corresponding shift-reduce action sequence is unique, and for a given item this canonical order restricts the possible derivations that can be formed using further actions. We now extend this observation to the more general case of an oracle forest, where there may be more than one gold-standard action for a given item. Definition 1. Given a gold-standard dependency 3","The derivation is “upside down”, following the conven-tion used for CCG, where the root is S [dcl]. We use sh, re and un to denote the three types of shift-reduce action. 221","Mr. President visited Paris","N /N N (S [dcl]\\NP)/NP NP","> >","N S[dcl]\\NP (a) Mr. President visited Paris N/N N (S [dcl]\\NP)/NP NP","> S[dcl]\\NP (b) Figure 3: Example subtrees on two stacks, with two subtrees in (a) and three in (b); roots of subtrees are in bold. structure G, an oracle forest ΦG, and an item ⟨s, q⟩, we say s is a realization of G, denoted s ≃ G, if |s| = 1, q is empty and the single derivation on s is correct. If |s| > 0 and the subtrees on s can lead to a correct derivation in ΦG using further actions, we say s is a partial-realization of G, denoted as s ∼ G. And we define s ∼ G for |s| = 0.","As an example, assume that ΦG contains only the derivation in Fig. 2a; then a stack containing the two subtrees in Fig. 3a is a partial-realization, while a stack containing the three subtrees in Fig. 3b is not. Note that each of the three subtrees in Fig. 3b is present in ΦG; however, these subtrees cannot be combined into the single correct derivation, since the correct sequence of shift-reduce actions must first combine the lexical categories for Mr. and President before shifting the lexical category for visited.","We denote an action as a pair (x, c), where x ∈ {SHIFT, REDUCE, UNARY} and c is the root of the subtree resulting from that action. For all three types of actions, c also corresponds to a unique conjunctive node in the complete forest Φ; and we use csi to denote the conjunctive node in Φ corresponding to subtree si on the stack. Let ⟨s′",", q′","⟩ = ⟨s, q⟩ ◦ (x, c) be the resulting item from applying the action (x, c) to ⟨s, q⟩; and let the set of all possible actions for ⟨s, q⟩ be X⟨s,q⟩ = {(x, c) | (x, c) is applicable to ⟨s, q⟩}.","Definition 2.

It determines, for a given item, whether an applicable action is valid in ΦG.","It is trivial to determine the validity of a SHIFT action for the initial item, ⟨s, q⟩0, since the SHIFT action is valid iff its category matches the gold-standard lexical category of the first word in the sentence. For any subsequent SHIFT action (SHIFT, c) to be valid, the necessary condition is c ≡ clex0, where clex0 denotes the gold-standard lexical category of the front word in the queue, q0 (line 3). However, this condition is not sufficient; a counterexample is the case where all the gold-standard lexical categories for the sentence in Figure 2 are shifted in succession. Hence, in general, the conditions under which an action is valid are more complex than the trivial case above.","First, suppose there is only one correct derivation in ΦG. A SHIFT action (SHIFT, clex0) is valid whenever cs0 (the conjunctive node in ΦG corresponding to the subtree s0 on the stack) and clex0 (the conjunctive node in ΦG corresponding to the next gold-standard lexical category from the queue) are both dominated by the conjunctive node parent p of cs0 in ΦG.4","A REDUCE action (REDUCE, c) is valid if c matches the category of the conjunctive node parent of cs0 and cs1 in ΦG. A UNARY action (UNARY, c) is valid if c matches the conjunctive node parent of cs0 in ΦG. We now generalize the case where ΦG contains a single correct parse to the case of an oracle forest, where each parent p is replaced by a set of conjunctive nodes in ΦG. Definition 4. The left parent set pL(c) of conjunctive node c ∈ ΦG is the set of all parent conjunctive nodes of c in ΦG, which have the disjunctive node d containing c (i.e. c ∈ γ(d)) as a left child. Definition 5. The ancestor set A(c) of conjunctive node c ∈ ΦG is the set of all reachable ancestor conjunctive nodes of c in ΦG. Definition 6.

In-tuitively, shared ancestor sets are built up through shift actions, and contain sets of nodes which can potentially become the results of reduce or unary actions. A further intuition is that shared ancestor sets define the space of possible correct derivations, and nodes in these sets are “ticked off” when reduce and unary actions are applied, as a single correct derivation is built through the shift-reduce process (corresponding to a bottom-up post-order traversal of the derivation). The following definition shows how the dependency oracle function builds shared ancestor sets for each action type.","Definition 7. Let ⟨s, q⟩ be an item and let","⟨s′ , q′ ⟩ = ⟨s, q⟩ ◦ (x, c).

Furthermore, the shared ancestor set is always empty when the stack is a frontier stack.","The dependency oracle algorithm checks the validity of applicable actions. A SHIFT action is valid if R(cs′","1, cs′","0) ̸= ∅ for the resulting stack s′ . A valid REDUCE action consumes s1 and s0. For the new node, its shared ancestor set is the subset of the conjunctive nodes in R(cs2, cs1) which dominate the resulting conjunctive node of a valid REDUCE action. The UNARY case for a frontier stack is trivial: any UNARY action applicable to s in ΦG is valid. For a non-frontier stack, the UNARY case is similar to REDUCE except the resulting shared ancestor set is a subset of R(cs1, cs0).","We now turn to the problem of finding the shared ancestor sets. In practice, we do not do this by traversing ΦG top-down from the conjunctive nodes in pL(cs0) on-the-fly to find each member of R. Instead, when we build ΦG in bottom-up topological order, we pre-compute the set of reachable disjunctive nodes of each conjunctive node c in ΦG as:","D(c) = δ(c) ∪ (∪c′ ∈γ(d),d∈δ(c)(D(c′",")))","Each D is implemented as a hash map, which allows us to test the membership of one potential conjunctive node in O(1) time. For example, a conjunctive node c ∈ pL(cs0) is reachable from clex0 if there is a disjunctive node d ∈ D(c) s.t. clex0 ∈ γ(d). With this implementation, the complexity of checking each valid SHIFT action is then O(|pL(cs0)|). 3.3 Training We use the averaged perceptron (Collins, 2002) to train a global linear model and score each action. The normal-form model of Zhang and Clark (2011) uses an early update mechanism (Collins and Roark, 2004), where decoding is stopped to update model weights whenever the single gold action falls outside the beam. In our parser, there can be multiple gold items in a beam. One option would be to apply early update whenever at least 223 Algorithm 3 Dependency Model Training","Input: (y, G) and beam size k 1: w ← 0; B0 ← ∅; i ← 0 2: B0.push(⟨s, q⟩0) ▷ the initial item 3: cand ← ∅ ▷ candidate output priority queue 4: gold ← ∅ ▷ gold output priority queue 5: while Bi ̸= ∅ do 6: for each ⟨s, q⟩ ∈ Bi do 7: if |q| = 0 then ▷ candidate output 8: cand.push(⟨s, q⟩) 9: if s ≃ G then ▷ s is a realization of G 10: gold.push(⟨s, q⟩) 11: expand ⟨s, q⟩ into Bi+1 12: Bi+1 ← Bi+1[1 : k] ▷ apply beam 13: if ΠG ̸= ∅, ΠG ∩ Bi+1 = ∅ and cand[0] ̸≃ G then 14: w ← w + φ(ΠG[0]) − φ(Bi+1[0]) ▷ early update 15: return 16: i ← i + 1 ▷ continue to next step 17: if cand[0] ̸≃ G then ▷ final update 18: w ← w + φ(gold[0]) − φ(cand[0]) one of these gold items falls outside the beam. However, this may not be a true violation of the gold-standard (Huang et al., 2012). Thus, we use a relaxed version of early update, in which all gold-standard actions must fall outside the beam before an update is performed. This update mechanism is provably correct under the violation-fixing framework of Huang et al. (2012).","Let (y, G) be a training sentence paired with its gold-standard dependency structure and let Π⟨s,q⟩ be the following set for an item ⟨s, q⟩: {⟨s, q⟩ ◦ (x, c) | fd(⟨s, q⟩, (x, c), ΦG) = true} Π⟨s,q⟩ contains all correct items at step i + 1 obtained by expanding ⟨s, q⟩.

For all experiments, we use CCGBank with the standard split: sections 2-21 for training (39,604 sentences), section 00 for development (1,913 sentences) and section 23 (2,407 sentences) for testing.","The way that the CCG grammar is implemented in C&C has some implications for our parser. First, unlike Z&C, which uses a context-free cover (Fowler and Penn, 2010) and hence is able to use all sentences in the training data, we are only able to use 36,036 sentences. The reason is that the grammar in C&C does not have complete coverage of CCGBank, due to the fact that e.g. not all rules in CCGBank conform to the combinatory rules of CCG. Second, our parser uses the unification mechanism from C&C to output dependencies directly, and hence does not need a separate postprocessing step to convert derivations into CCG dependencies, as required by Z&C.","The feature templates of our model consist of all of those in Z&C, except the ones which re-quire lexical heads to come from either the left or right child, as such features are incompatible with the head passing mechanism used by C&C. Each Z&C template is defined over a parse item, and captures various aspects of the stack and queue context. For example, one template returns the top category on the stack plus its head word, together with the first word and its POS tag on the queue. Another template returns the second category on the stack, together with the POS tag of its head word. Every Z&C feature is defined as a pair, consisting of an instantiated context template and a parse action. In addition, we use all the CCG predicate-argument dependency features from Clark and Curran (2007), which contribute to the score of a REDUCE action when dependencies 224","LP % LR % LF % LSent. % CatAcc. % coverage % this parser 86.29 84.09 85.18 34.40 92.75 100 Z&C 87.15 82.95 85.00 33.82 92.77 100 C&C (normal-form) 85.22 82.52 83.85 31.63 92.40 100 this parser 86.76 84.90 85.82 34.72 93.20 99.06 (C&C coverage) Z&C 87.55 83.63 85.54 34.14 93.11 99.06 (C&C coverage) C&C (hybrid) – – 85.25 – – 99.06 (C&C coverage) C&C (normal-form) 85.22 84.29 84.76 31.93 92.83 99.06 (C&C coverage) Table 1: Accuracy comparison on Section 00 (auto POS). 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Precision % Dependency length (bins of 5) C&C Z&C","this parser (a) precision vs. dependency length 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Recall % Dependency length (bins of 5) C&C Z&C","this parser (b) recall vs. dependency length Figure 4: Labeled precision and recall relative to dependency length on the development set.

We run 20 training iterations and the resulting model contains 16.5M features with a nonzero weight.","We use 10-fold cross validation for POS tagging and supertagging the training data, and automatically assigned POS tags for all experiments. A probability cut-off value of 0.0001 for the β parameter in the supertagger is used for both training and testing. The β parameter determines how many lexical categories are assigned to each word; β = 0.0001 is a relatively small value which allows in a large number of categories, compared to the default value used in Clark and Curran (2007). For training only, if the gold-standard lexical category is not supplied by the supertagger for a particular word, it is added to the list of categories. 4.1 Results and Analysis The beam size was tuned on the development set, and a value of 128 was found to achieve a reasonable balance of accuracy and speed; hence this value was used for all experiments. Since C&C always enforces non-fragmentary output (i.e. it can only produce spanning analyses), it fails on some sentences in the development and test sets, and thus we also evaluate on the reduced sets, following Clark and Curran (2007). Our parser does not fail on any sentences because it permits fragmentary output (those cases where there is more than one subtree left on the final stack). The results for Z&C, and the C&C normal-form and hybrid models, are taken from Zhang and Clark (2011).","Table 1 shows the accuracies of all parsers on the development set, in terms of labeled precision and recall over the predicate-argument dependencies in CCGBank. On both the full and reduced sets, our parser achieves the highest F-score. In comparison with C&C, our parser shows significant increases across all metrics, with 0.57% and 1.06% absolute F-score improvements over the hybrid and normal-form models, respectively. Another major improvement over the other two parsers is in sentence level accuracy, LSent, which measures the number of sentences for which the dependency structure is completely correct.","Table 1 also shows that our parser has improved recall over Z&C at some expense of precision. To probe this further we compare labeled precision and recall relative to dependency length, as measured by the distance between the two words in a dependency, grouped into bins of 5 values. Fig. 4 shows clearly that Z&C favors precision over recall, giving higher precision scores for almost all dependency lengths compared to our parser.

Our work is in part inspired by the dependency models of Clark and Curran (2007) and, in the use of a dependency oracle, is close in spirit to that of Goldberg and Nivre (2012). The difference is that the Goldberg and Nivre parser builds, and scores, dependency structures directly, whereas our parser uses a unification mechanism to create dependencies, and scores the CCG derivations, allowing great flexibility in terms of what dependencies can be realized. Another related work is Yu et al. (2013), which introduced a similar technique to deal with spurious ambiguity in MT. Finally, there may be potential to integrate the techniques of Auli and Lopez (2011), which currently represents the state-of-the-art in CCGBank parsing, into our parser."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.
