Additionally, some social networking services such as Twitter don’t support this type of structured profile data. It is therefore difficult to obtain a reasonably comprehensive profile of a user, or a reasonably complete facet of information (say, education level) for a class of users. While many users do not explicitly list all their personal information in their online profile, their user generated content often contains strong evidence to suggest many types of user attributes, for example education, spouse, and employment (See Table 1). Can one use such information to infer more details? In particular, can one exploit indirect clues from an unstructured data source like Twitter to obtain rich, structured user profiles?","In this paper we demonstrate that it is feasible to automatically extract Facebook-style pro-165 files directly from users’ tweets, thus making user profile data available in a structured format for upstream applications. We view user profile inference as a structured prediction task where both text and network information are incorporated. Concretely, we cast user profile prediction as binary relation extraction (Brin, 1999), e.g., SPOUSE(Useri, Userj), EDUCATION(Useri, Entityj) and EMPLOYER(Useri, Entityj). Inspired by the concept of distant supervision, we collect training tweets by matching attribute ground truth from an outside “knowledge base” such as Facebook or Google Plus.","One contribution of the work presented here is the creation of the first large-scale dataset on three general Twitter user profile domains (i.e., EDUCATION, JOB, SPOUSE). Experiments demonstrate that by simultaneously harnessing both text features and network information, our approach is able to make accurate user profile predictions. We are optimistic that our approach can easily be applied to further user attributes such as HOBBIES and INTERESTS (MOVIES, BOOKS, SPORTS or STARS), RELIGION, HOMETOWN, LIVING LOCA-TION, FAMILY MEMBERS and so on, where training data can be obtained by matching ground truth retrieved from multiple types of online social media such as Facebook, Google Plus, or LinkedIn. Our contributions are as follows:","• We cast user profile prediction as an information extraction task.","• We present a large-scale dataset for this task gathered from various structured and unstructured social media sources.","• We demonstrate the benefit of jointly reasoning about users’ social network structure when extracting their profiles from text.","• We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on 3 relations: SPOUSE, JOB and EDUCATION.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: We summarize related work in Section 2. The creation of our dataset is described in Section 3. The details of our model are presented in Section 4. We present experimental results in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["While user profile inference from social media has received considerable attention (Al Zamal et al., 2012; Rao and Yarowsky, 2010; Rao et al., 2010; Rao et al., 2011), most previous work has treated this as a classification task where the goal is to predict unary predicates describing attributes of the user. Examples include gender (Ciot et al., 2013; Liu and Ruths, 2013; Liu et al., 2012), age (Rao et al., 2010), or political polarity (Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Conover et al., 2011).","A significant challenge that has limited previous efforts in this area is the lack of available training data. For example, researchers obtain training data by employing workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to manually identify users’ gender from profile pictures (Ciot et al., 2013). This approach is appropriate for attributes such as gender with a small numbers of possible values (e.g., male or female), for which the values can be directly identified. However for attributes such as spouse or education there are many possible values, making it impossible to manually search for gold standard answers within a large number of tweets which may or may not contain sufficient evidence.","Also related is the Twitter user timeline extraction algorithm of Li and Cardie (2013). This work is not focused on user attribute extraction, however. Distant Supervision Distant supervision, also known as weak supervision, is a method for learning to extract relations from text using ground truth from an existing database as a source of supervision. Rather than relying on mention-level annotations, which are expensive and time consuming to generate, distant supervision leverages readily available structured data sources as a weak source of supervision for relation extraction from related text corpora (Craven et al., 1999). For example, suppose r(e1, e2) = IsIn(P aris, F rance) is a ground tuple in the database and s =“Paris is the capital of France” contains synonyms for both “Paris” and “France”, then we assume that s may express the fact r(e1, e2) in some way and can be used as positive training examples. In addition to the wide use in text entity relation extraction (Mintz et al., 2009; Ritter et al., 2013; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012; Takamatsu et al., 2012), distant supervision has been applied to multiple 166 Figure 1: Illustration of Goolge Plus “knowledge base”. fields such as protein relation extraction (Craven et al., 1999; Ravikumar et al., 2012), event extraction from Twitter (Benson et al., 2011), sentiment analysis (Go et al., 2009) and Wikipedia infobox generation (Wu and Weld, 2007). Homophily Online social media offers a rich source of network information. McPherson et al. (2001) discovered that people sharing more attributes such as background or hobby have a higher chance of becoming friends in social media. This property, known as HOMOPHILY (summarized by the proverb “birds of a feather flock together”) (Al Zamal et al., 2012) has been widely applied to community detection (Yang and Leskovec, 2013) and friend recommendation (Guy et al., 2010) on social media. In the user attribute extraction literature, researchers have considered neighborhood context to boost inference accuracy (Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Al Zamal et al., 2012), where information about the degree of their connectivity to their pre-labeled users is included in the feature vectors. A related algorithm by Mislove et al. (2010) crawled Facebook profiles of 4,000 Rice University students and alumni and in-ferred attributes such as major and year of matriculation purely based on network information. Mislove’s work does not consider the users’ text stream, however. As we demonstrate below, relying solely on network information is not enough to enable inference about attributes."]},{"title":"3 Dataset Creation","paragraphs":["We now describe the generation of our distantly supervised training dataset in detail.

Concretely, we crawled circle information of users in the seed set from both their Twitter and Google Plus accounts and performed a matching to pick out shared users between one’s Twitter follower list and Google Plus Circle. This process assures friend identity and avoids the problem of name ambiguity when matching accounts across websites. Among candidate users, those who explicitly display Job or Education information on Google Plus are preserved. We then gathered positive and negative data as described above.","Dataset statistics are presented in Table 2.

We augment negative training data from e2 as in the case of Education and Job. Our Spouse dataset contains 1,636 users, where there are 554 couples (1108 users). Note that the number of positive entities (3,121) is greater than the number of users as (1) one user can have multiple spouses at different periods of time (2) multiple entities may point to the same individual, e.g., BarackObama, Barack Obama and Barack."]},{"title":"4 Model","paragraphs":["We now describe our approach to predicting user profile attributes. 4.1 Notation Message X: Each user i ∈ [1, I] is associated with his Twitter ID and his tweet corpus Xi.

(2009).","(2) LOCAL makes local tweet-level predictions for each tweet ze","i,x, x ∈ Lk","i in the first place, making the stronger assumption that all mentions of an entity in the users’ profile are expressing the associated attribute.

The model and parameters with LOCAL are identical to those in GLOBAL except that LOCAL 168 encode a tweet-level feature vector rather than an aggregate one. They are therefore excluded for brevity. For each attribute k, we use a model that factorizes the joint distribution as product of two distributions that separately characterize text features and network information as follows:","Ψ(zk","i,e, Xi, F k i : Θ) ∝","Ψtext(zk","i,e, Xi)ΨNeigh(zk","i,e, F k","i ) (2)","Text Factor We use Ψtext","(zk","e , Xi) to capture the","text related features which offer attribute clues:","Ψtext(zk","e , , Xi) = exp[(Θk","text)T","· ψtext(zk","i,e, Xi)]","(3)","The feature vector ψtext(zk","i,e, Xi) encodes the fol-","lowing standard general features: • Entity-level: whether begins with capital let-","ter, length of entity. • Token-level: for each token t ∈ e, word iden-","tity, word shape, part of speech tags, name","entity tags. • Conjunctive features for a window of k","(k=1,2) words and part of speech tags. • Tweet-level: All tokens in the correspondent","tweet.

We expect clues about whether Ci being entity e’s spouse from e’s Twitter corpus will in turn facilitate the spouse inference procedure of user i. ψNeigh(Ci, Xe) encodes I(Ci ∈ Se), I(Ci ̸∈ Se). Features we explore also include whether Ci’s twitter ID appears in e’s corpus. 4.3 Training We separately trained three classifiers regarding the three attributes. All variables are observed during training; we therefore take a feature-based approach to learning structure prediction models inspired by structure compilation (Liang et al., 2008). In our setting, a subset of the features (those based on network information) are computed based on predictions that will need to be made at test time, but are observed during training. This simplified approach to learning avoids expensive inference; at test time, however, we still need to jointly predict the best attribute values for friends as is described in section 4.4. 4.4 Inference Job and Education Our inference algorithm for Job/Education is performed on two settings, depending on whether neighbor information is 169 observed (NEIGH-OBSERVED) or latent (NEIGH-LATENT). Real world applications, where network information can be partly retrieved from all types of social networks, can always falls in between.","Inference in the NEIGH-OBSERVED setting is trivial; for each entity e ∈ Gi, we simply predict it’s candidate attribute values using Equ.6. zk i,e = argmax","z′","Ψ(z′ , Xi, F k","i ) (6)","For NEIGH-LATENT setting, attributes for each node along the network are treated latent and user attribute prediction depends on attributes of his neighbors. The objective function for joint inference would be difficult to optimize exactly, and algorithms for doing so would be unlikely to scale to network of the size we consider. Instead, we use a sieve-based greedy search approach to inference (shown in Figure 3) inspired by recent work on coreference resolution (Raghunathan et al., 2010). Attributes are initialized using only text features, maximizing Ψtext(e, Xi), and ignoring network information. Then for each user we iteratively reestimate their profile given both their text features and network features (computed based on the current predictions made for their friends) which provide additional evidence.","In this way, highly confident predictions will be made strictly from text in the first round, then the network can either support or contradict low confidence predictions as more decisions are made. This process continues until no changes are made at which point the algorithm terminates. We empirically found it to work well in practice. We expect that NEIGH-OBSERVED performs better than NEIGH-LATENT since the former benefits from gold network information. Spouse For Spouse inference, if candidate entity e has no correspondent twitter account, we directly determine zk","i,e = argmaxz′ Ψ(z′",", Xi) from text features. Otherwise, the inference of zk","i,e depends","on the zk","e,Ci. Similarly, we initialize zk","i,e and zk","e,Ci","by maximizing text factor, as we did for Educa-","tion and Job. Then we iteratively update zk","given","by the rest variables until convergence."]},{"title":"5 Experiments","paragraphs":["In this Section, we present our experimental results in detail.","Education Job AFFINITY 74.3 14.5 Table 3: Affinity values for Education and Job. 5.1 Preprocessing and Experiment Setup Each tweet posting is tokenized using Twitter NLP tool introduced by Noah’s Ark14","with # and @ separated following tokens. We assume that attribute values should be either name entities or terms following @ and #. Name entities are extracted using Ritter et al.’s NER system (2011).

The first is used as training data and the other as testing data. 5.2 Friends with Same Attribute Our network intuition is that users are much more likely to be friends with other users who share attributes, when compared to users who have no attributes in common. In order to statistically show this, we report the value of AFFINITY defined by Mislove et al (2010), which is used to quantitatively evaluate the degree of HOMOPHILY in the network. AFFINITY is the ratio of the fraction of links between attribute (k)-sharing users (Sk), relative to what is expected if attributes are randomly assigned in the network (Ek).

Table 3 shows the affinity value of the Education and Job. As we can see, the property of HOMOPHILY in-deed exists among users in the social network with respect to Education and Job attribute, as significant affinity is observed. In particular, the affinity value for Education is 74.3, implying that users connected by a link in the network are 74.3 times more likely affiliated in the same school than as expected if education attributes are randomly assigned. It is interesting to note that Education exhibits a much stronger HOMOPHILY property than","14","https://code.google.com/p/ ark-tweet-nlp/downloads/list 170 Job. Such affinity demonstrates that our approach that tries to take advantage of network information for attribute prediction of holds promise. 5.3 Evaluation and Discussion We evaluate settings described in Section 4.2 i.e., GLOBAL setting, where user-level attribute is predicted directly from jointly feature space and LOCAL setting where user-level prediction is made based on tweet-level prediction along with different inference approaches described in Section 4.4, i.e. NEIGH-OBSERVED and NEIGH-LATENT, regarding whether neighbor information is observed or latent. Baselines We implement the following baselines for comparison and use identical processing techniques for each approach for fairness.","• Only-Text: A simplified version of our algorithm where network/neighbor influence is ignored. Classifier is trained and tested only based on text features.","• NELL: For Job and Education, candidate is selected as attribute value once it matches bag of words in the list of universities or companies borrowed from NELL. For Education, the list is extended by alias identification based on Freebase. For Job, we also fetch the name abbreviations15",". NELL is only implemented for Education and Job attribute. For each setting from each approach, we report the (P)recision, (R)ecall and (F)1-score. For LOCAL setting, we report the performance for both entity-level prediction (Entity) and posting-level prediction (Tweet). Results for Education, Job and Spouse from different approaches appear in Table 4, 5 and 6 respectively. Local or Global For horizontal comparison, we observe that GLOBAL obtains a higher Precision score but a lower Recall than LOCAL(ENTITY). This can be explained by the fact that LOCAL(U) sets zk","i,e = 1 once one posting x ∈ Le","i is identified as attribute related, while GLOBAL tend to be more meticulous by considering the conjunctive feature space from all postings. Homophile effect In agreement with our expectation, NEIGH-OBSERVED performs better than NEIGH-LATENT since erroneous predictions in 15 http://www.abbreviations.com/ NEIGH-LATENT setting will have negative influence on further prediction during the greedy search process. Both NEIGH-OBSERVED and NEIGH-LATENT where network information is harnessed, perform better than Only-Text, which the prediction is made independently on user’s text features. The improvement of NEIGH-OBSERVED over Only-Text is 22.7% and 6.4% regarding F1 score for Education and Job respectively, which further illustrate the usefulness of making use of Homophile effect for attribute inference on online social media. It is also interesting to note the improvement much more significant in Education inference than Job inference. This is in accord with what we find in Section 5.2, where education network exhibits stronger HOMOPHILE property than Job network, enabling a significant benefit for education inference, but limited for job inference.","Spouse prediction also benefits from neighboring effect and the improvement is about 12% for LOCAL(ENTITY) setting. Unlike Education and Job prediction, for which in NEIGH-OBSERVED setting all neighboring variables are observed, network variables are hidden during spouse prediction. By considering network information, the model benefits from evident clues offered by tweet corpus of user e’s spouse when making prediction for e, but also suffers when erroneous decision are made and then used for downstream predictions. NELL Baseline Notably, NELL achieves high-est Recall score for Education inference. It is also worth noting that most of education mentions that NELL fails to retrieve are those in-volve irregular spellings, such as HarvardUniv and Cornell U, which means Recall score for NELL baseline would be even higher if these irregular spellings are recognized in a more sophisticated system. The reason for such high recall is that as our ground truths are obtained from Google plus, the users from which are mostly affiliated with decent schools found in NELL dictionary. However, the high recall from NELL is sacrificed at precision, as users can mention school entities in many of situations, such as paying a visit or reporting some relevant news. NELL will erroneously classify these cases as attribute mentions.","NELL does not work out for Job, with a fairly poor 0.0156 F1 score for LOCAL(ENTITY) and 0.163 for LOCAL(TWEET).

Vertical Comparison: Education, Job and Spouse Job prediction turned out to be much more difficult than Education, as shown in Tables 4 and 5. Explanations are as follows: (1) Job contains a much greater diversity of mentions than Education. Education inference can benefit a lot from the dictionary relevant feature which Job may not. (2) Education mentions are usually associated with clear evidence such as homework, exams, studies, cafeteria or books, while situations are much more complicated for job as vocabularies are usually specific for different types of jobs. (3) The boundary between a user working in and a fun for a specific operation is usually ambiguous. For example, a Google engineer may constantly update information about outcome products of Google, so does a big fun. If the aforementioned engineer barely tweets about working conditions or colleagues (which might still be ambiguous), his tweet collection, which contains many of mentions about outcomes of Google product, will be significantly similar to tweets published by a Google fun. Such nuisance can be partly solved by the consideration of network information, but not totally.","The relatively high F1 score for spouse prediction is largely caused by the great many of nonindividual related entities in the dataset, the identification of which would be relatively simpler. A deeper look at the result shows that the classifier frequently makes wrong decisions for entities such as userID and name entities. Significant as some spouse relevant features are, such as love, husband, child, in most circumstances, spouse mentions are extremely hard to recognize. For example, in tweets “Check this out, @alancross, it’s awesome bit.ly/1bnjYHh.” or “Happy Birth-day @alancross !”. alancross can reasonably be any option among current user’s friend, colleague, parents, child or spouse. Repeated mentions add no confidence. Although we can identify alancross as spouse attribute once it jointly appear with other strong spouse indicators, they are still many cases where they never co-appear. How to integrate more useful side information for spouse recognition constitutes our future work."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper, we propose a framework for user attribute inference on Twitter.

We will keep updating the dataset as more data is collected.","One direction of our future work involves exploring more general categories of user profile at-172 tributes, such as interested books, movies, hometown, religion and so on.
