Typical approaches use a pipeline architecture that clusters the mentions using fixed or learned measures of name and context similarity. In this paper, we propose a model for cross-document coreference resolution that achieves robustness by learning similarity from unlabeled data. The generative process assumes that each entity mention arises from copying and optionally mutating an earlier name from a similar context. Clustering the mentions into entities depends on recovering this copying tree jointly with estimating models of the mutation process and parent selection process. We present a block Gibbs sampler for posterior inference and an empirical evaluation on several datasets."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Variation poses a serious challenge for determin-ing who or what a name refers to. For instance, Wikipedia contains more than 100 variations of the name Barack Obama as redirects to the U.S. President article, including: President Obama Barack H. Obama, Jr. Barak Obamba Barry Soetoro To relate different names, one solution is to use specifically tailored measures of name similarity such as Jaro-Winkler similarity (Winkler, 1999; Cohen et al., 2003). This approach is brittle, however, and fails to adapt to the test data. Another option is to train a model like stochastic edit distance from known pairs of similar names (Ristad and Yianilos, 1998; Green et al., 2012), but this requires supervised data in the test domain.","Even the best model of name similarity is not enough by itself, since two names that are similar— even identical—do not necessarily corefer. Document context is needed to determine whether they may be talking about two different people.","In this paper, we propose a method for jointly (1) learning similarity between names and (2) clustering name mentions into entities, the two major components of cross-document coreference resolution systems (Baron and Freedman, 2008; Finin et al., 2009; Rao et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2012; Green et al., 2012). Our model is an evolutionary generative process based on the name variation model of Andrews et al. (2012), which stipulates that names are often copied from previously generated names, perhaps with mutation (spelling edits). This can deduce that rather than being names for different entities, Barak Obamba and Barock obama more likely arose from the frequent name Barack Obama as a common ancestor, which accounts for most of their letters. This can also relate seemingly dissimilar names via multiple steps in the generative process: Taylor Swift → T-Swift → T-Swizzle Our model learns without supervision that these all refer to the the same entity. Such creative spellings are especially common on Twitter and other social media; we give more examples of coreferents learned by our model in Section 8.4.","Our primary contributions are improvements on Andrews et al. (2012) for the entity clustering task. Their inference procedure only clustered types (distinct names) rather than tokens (mentions in context), and relied on expensive matrix inversions for learning. Our novel approach features: §4.1 A topical model of which entities from previ-","ously written text an author tends to mention","from previously written text. §4.2 A name mutation model that is sensitive to","features of the input and output characters and","takes a reader’s comprehension into account. §5 A scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo sam-","pler used in training and inference. 775 §7 A minimum Bayes risk decoding procedure","to pick an output clustering. The procedure is","applicable to any model capable of producing","a posterior over coreference decisions. We evaluate our approach by comparing to sev-","eral baselines on datasets from three different gen-","res: Twitter, newswire, and blogs."]},{"title":"2 Overview and Related Work","paragraphs":["Cross-document coreference resolution (CDCR) was first introduced by Bagga and Baldwin (1998b). Most approaches since then are based on the intuitions that coreferent names tend to have “similar” spellings and tend to appear in “similar” contexts. The distinguishing feature of our system is that both notions of similarity are learned together without supervision.","We adopt a “phylogenetic” generative model of coreference. The basic insight is that coreference is created when an author thinks of an entity that was mentioned earlier in a similar context, and mentions it again in a similar way. The author may alter the name mention string when copying it, but both names refer to the same entity. Either name may later be copied further, leading to an evolutionary tree of mentions—a phylogeny. Phylogenetic models are new to information extraction. In com-putational historical linguistics, Bouchard-Côté et al. (2013) have also modeled the mutation of strings along the edges of a phylogeny; but for them the phylogeny is observed and most mentions are not, while we observe the mentions only.","To apply our model to the CDCR task, we observe that the probability that two name mentions are coreferent is the probability that they arose from a common ancestor in the phylogeny. So we design a Monte Carlo sampler to reconstruct likely phylogenies. A phylogeny must explain every observed name. While our model is capable of generating each name independently, a phylogeny will generally achieve higher probability if it explains similar names as being similar by mutation (rather than by coincidence). Thus, our sampled phylogenies tend to make similar names coreferent—especially long or unusual names that would be expensive to generate repeatedly, and especially in contexts that are topically similar and therefore have a higher prior probability of coreference.","For learning, we iteratively adjust our model’s parameters to better explain our samples. That is, we do unsupervised training via Monte Carlo EM.","What is learned? An important component of a CDCR system is its model of name similarity (Winkler, 1999; Porter and Winkler, 1997), which is often fixed up front. This role is played in our system by the name mutation model, which we take to be a variant of stochastic edit distance (Ristad and Yianilos, 1996). Rather than fixing its parameters before we begin CDCR, we learn them (without supervision) as part of CDCR, by training from samples of reconstructed phylogenies.","Name similarity is also an important component of within-document coreference resolution, and efforts in that area bear resemblance to our approach. Haghighi and Klein (2010) describe an “entity-centered” model where a distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process is used to pick previous coreferent mentions within a document. Similarly, Durrett and Klein (2013) learn a mention similarity model based on labeled data. Our cross-document setting has no observed mention ordering and no observed entities: we must sum over all possibilities, a challenging inference problem.","The second major component of CDCR is context-based disambiguation of similar or identical names that refer to the same entity. Like Kozareva and Ravi (2011) and Green et al. (2012) we use topics as the contexts, but learn mention topics jointly with other model parameters."]},{"title":"3 Generative Model of Coreference","paragraphs":["Let x = (x1, . . . , xN ) denote an ordered sequence of distinct named-entity mentions in documents d = (d1, . . . , dD). We assume that each document has a (single) known language, and that its mentions and their types have been identified by a named-entity recognizer. We use the objectoriented notation x.v for attribute v of mention x.","Our model generates an ordered sequence x although we do not observe its order. Thus each mention x has latent position x.i (e.g., x729.i = 729). The entire corpus, including these entities, is generated according to standard topic model assump-tions; we first generate a topic distribution for a document, then sample topics and words for the document (Blei et al., 2003). However, any topic may generate an entity type, e.g. PERSON, which is then replaced by a specific name: whenPERSON is generated, the model chooses a previous mention of any person and copies it, perhaps mutating its name.1","Alternatively, the model may manufacture 1 We make the closed-world assumption that the author is 776 a name for a new person, though the name itself may not be new.","If all previous mentions were equally likely, this would be a Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) in which frequently mentioned entities are more likely to be mentioned again (“the rich get richer”). We refine that idea by saying that the current topic, language, and document influence the choice of which previous mention to copy, similar to the distance-dependent CRP (Blei and Frazier, 2011).2","This will help distinguish multiple John Smith entities if they tend to appear in different contexts.","Formally, each mention x is derived from a parent mention x.p where x.p.i < x.i (the parent came first), x.e = x.p.e (same entity) and x.n is a copy or mutation of x.p.n. In the special case where x is a first mention ofx.e, x.p is the special symbol ♦, x.e is a newly allocated entity of some appropriate type, and the name x.n is generated from scratch.","Our goal is to reconstruct mappings p, i, z that specify the latent properties of the mentions x. The mapping p : x ↦→ x.p forms a phylogenetic tree on the mentions, with root ♦. Each entity corresponds to a subtree that is rooted at some child of ♦. The mapping i : x ↦→ x.i gives an ordering consistent with that tree in the sense that (∀x)x.p.i < x.i. Finally, the mapping z : x ↦→ x.z specifies, for each mention, the topic that generated it. While i and z are not necessary for creating coref clusters, they are needed to produce p."]},{"title":"4 Detailed generative story","paragraphs":["Given a few constants that are referenced in the main text, we assume that the corpus d was generated as follows.","First, for each topic z = 1, . . . K and each language l, choose a multinomial βzl over the word vocabulary, from a symmetric Dirichlet with concentration parameter η. Then set m = 0 (entity only aware of previous mentions from our corpus. This means that two mentions cannot be derived from a common ancestor outside our corpus. To mitigate this unrealistic assumption, we allow any ordering x of the observed mentions, not respecting document timestamps or forcing the mentions from a given document to be generated as a contiguous subsequence of x.","2","Unlike the ddCRP, our generative story is careful to prohibit derivational cycles: each mention is copied from a previous mention in the latent ordering. This is why our phylogeny is a tree, and why our sampler is more complex. Also unlike the ddCRP, we permit asymmetric “distances”: if a certain topic or language likes to copy mentions from another, the compliment is not necessarily returned. count), i = 0 (mention count), and for each document index d = 1, . . . , D:","1.

Choose the parent x.p from a distribution conditioned on the attributes just set (see §4.1).","iii. If x.p = ♦, increment m and set x.e = a new entity em. Else set x.e = x.p.e.","iv. Choose x.n from a distribution conditioned on x.p.n and x.l (see §4.2).","Notice that the tokens wdk in document d are exchangeable: by collapsing out ψd, we can regard them as having been generated from a CRP. Thus, for fixed values of the non-mention tokens and their topics, the probability of generating the mention sequence x is proportional to the product of the probabilities of the choices in step 3 at the positions dk where mentions were generated. These choices generate a topic x.z (from the CRP for document d), a type x.e.t (from βx.z), a parent mention (from the distribution over previous mentions), and a name string (conditioned on the parent’s name if any). §5 uses this fact to construct an MCMC sampler for the latent parts of x. 4.1 Sub-model for parent selection To select a parent for a mention x of type t = x.e.t, a simple model (as mentioned above) would be a CRP: each previous mention of the same type is selected with probability proportional to 1, and ♦ is","3","Extension: This choice could depend on the language d.l. 777 selected with probability proportional to αt > 0.

The features f are extracted from the attributes of x and x.p. Our most important feature tests whether x.p.z = x.z. This binary feature has a high weight if authors mainly choose mentions from the same topic. To model which (other) topics tend to be selected, we also have a binary feature for each parent topic x.p.z and each topic pair (x.p.z, x.z).4 4.2 Sub-model for name mutation Let x denote a mention with parent p = x.p. As in Andrews et al. (2012), its name x.n is a stochastic transduction of its parent’s name p.n. That is, Prθ(x.n | p.n) (2) is given by the probability that applying a random sequence of edits to the characters of p.n would yield x.n. The contextual probabilities of different edits depend on learned parameters θ.","(2) is the total probability of all edit sequences that derive x.n from p.n. It can be computed in time O(|x.n| · |p.n|) by dynamic programming.","The probability of a single edit sequence, which corresponds to a monotonic alignment of x.n to p.n, is a product of individual edit probabilities of the form Prθ((a","b) | â), which is conditioned on the next input character â. The edit (a","b) replaces input a ∈ {ε, â} with output b ∈ {ε} ∪ Σ (where ε is","4","Many other features could be added. In a multilingual setting, one would similarly want to model whether English authors select Arabic mentions. One could also imagine features that reward proximity in the generative order (x.p.i ≈ x.i), local linguistic relationships (when x.p.d = x.d and x.p.k ≈ x.k), or social information flow (e.g., from main-stream media to Twitter). One could also make more specific versions of any feature by conjoining it with the entity type t. the empty string and Σ is the alphabet of language x.l). Insertions and deletions are the cases where respectively a = ε or b = ε—we do not allow both at once. All other edits are substitutions. When â is the special end-of-string symbol #, the only allowed edits are the insertion (ε","b) and the substitution (#","#). We define the edit probability using a locally normalized log-linear model:","Prθ((a b) | â) = exp(θ · f (â, a, b))","∑ a′ ,b′ exp(θ · f (â, a′",", b′",")) (3)","We use a small set of simple feature functions f , which consider conjunctions of the attributes of the characters â and b: character, character class (letter, digit, etc.), and case (upper vs. lower).","More generally, the probability (2) may also be conditioned on other variables such as on the languages p.l and x.l—this leaves room for a transliteration model when x.l ̸= p.l—and on the entity type x.t. The features in (3) may then depend on these variables as well.","Notice that we use a locally normalized probability for each edit. This enables faster and simpler training than the similar model of Dreyer et al. (2008), which uses a globally normalized probability for the whole edit sequence.","When p = ♦, we are generating a new name x.n. We use the same model, taking ♦.n to be the empty string (but with #♦ rather than # as the end-of-string symbol). This yields a feature-based unigram language model (whose character probabilities may differ from usual insertion probabilities because they see #♦ as the lookahead character).","Pragmatics. We can optionally make the model more sophisticated. Authors tend to avoid names x.n that readers would misinterpret (given the previously generated names). The edit model thinks that Prθ(CIA | ♦) is relatively high (because CIA is a short string) and so is Prθ(CIA | Chuck’s Ice Art). But in fact, if CIA has already been frequently used to refer to the Central Intelligence Agency, then an author is unlikely to use it for a different entity.","To model this pragmatic effect, we multiply our definition of Prθ(x.n | p.n) by an extra factor Pr(x.e | x)γ",", where γ ≥ 0 is the effect strength.5","Here Pr(x.e | x) is the probability that a reader correctly identifies the entity x.e.

Thus, we sample i or z from a simpler proposal distribution, but correct the discrepancy using the Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) strategy: with an appropriate probability, reject the proposed new value and instead use another copy of the current value (Tierney, 1994). 5.1 Resampling the ordering i We resample the ordering i of the mentions x, conditioned on the other variables. The current phylogeny p already defines a partial order onx, since each parent must precede its children. For instance, phylogeny (a) below requires ♦ ≺ x and ♦ ≺ y. This partial order is compatible with 2 total orderings, ♦ ≺ x ≺ y and ♦ ≺ y ≺ x. By contrast, phylogeny (b) requires the total ordering ♦ ≺ x ≺ y. ♦ yx (a) ♦ x y (b)","We first sample an ordering i♦ (the ordering of mentions with parent ♦, i.e. all mentions) uniformly at random from the set of orderings compatible with the current p.

Otherwise we reject i♦ and reuse i for the new sample. 5.2 Resampling the topics z Each context word and each named entity is associated with a latent topic. The topics of context words are assumed exchangeable, and so we resample them using Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).","Unfortunately, this is prohibitively expensive for the (non-exchangeable) topics of the named mentions x. A Gibbs sampler would have to choose a new value for x.z with probability proportional to the resulting joint probability of the full sample. This probability is expensive to evaluate because changing x.z will change the probability of many edges in the current phylogeny p. (Equation (1) puts x is in competition with other parents, so every mention y that follows x must recompute how happy it is with its current parent y.p.)","Rather than resampling one topic at a time, we resample z as a block. We use a proposal distribution for which block sampling is efficient, and use IMH to correct the error in this proposal distribution.","Our proposal distribution is an undirected graph-ical model whose random variables are the topics z and whose graph structure is given by the current phylogeny p: Q(z) ∝ ∏ x̸=♦ Ψx(x.z)Ψx.p,x(x.p.z, x.z) (5) Q(z) is an approximation to the posterior distribution over z. As detailed below, a proposal can be sampled from Q(z) in time O(|z|K2",") where K is the number of topics, because the only interac-tions among topics are along the edges of the tree p. The unary factor Ψx gives a weight for each possible value of x.z, and the binary factor Ψx.p,x gives a weight for each possible value of the pair (x.p.z, x.z).","The Ψx(x.z) factors in (5) approximate the topic model’s prior distribution over z. Ψx(x.z) is proportional to the probability that a Gibbs sampling step for an ordinary topic model would choose this value of x.z. This depends on whether—in the 779 current sample—x.z is currently common in x’s document and x.t is commonly generated by x.z. It ignores the fact that we will also be resampling the topics of the other mentions.","The Ψx.p,x factors in (5) approximate Pr(p | z, i) (up to a constant factor), where p is the current phylogeny. Specifically,Ψx.p,x approximates the probability of a single edge. It ought to be given by (1), but we use only the numerator of (1), which avoids modeling the competition among parents.","We sample from Q using standard methods, similar to sampling from a linear-chain CRF by run-ning the backward algorithm followed by forward sampling. Specifically, we run the sum-product algorithm from the leaves up to the root ♦, at each node x computing the following for each topic z: βx(z) def = Ψx(z) · ∏ y∈children(x) ∑ z′","Ψx,y(z, z′ ) · β","y(z′ ) Then we sample from the root down to the leaves, first sampling ♦.z from β♦, then at each x ̸= ♦ sampling the topic x.z to be z with probability proportional to Ψx.p,x(x.p.z, z) · βx(z).","Again we use IMH to correct for the bias in Q: we accept the resulting proposal ẑ with probability min ( 1, Pr(p, i, ẑ, x | θ, φ) Pr(p, i, z, x | θ, φ) · Q(z) Q( ẑ) ) (6) While Pr(p, i, ẑ, x | θ, φ) might seem slow to compute because it contains many factors (1) with different denominators Z(x), one can share work by visiting the mentions x in their order i. Most summands in Z(x) were already included in Z(x′","), where x′","is the latest previous mention having the same attributes as x (e.g., same topic). 5.3 Resampling the phylogeny p It is easy to resample the phylogeny. For each x, we must choose a parent x.p from among the possible parents p (having p.i < x.i and p.e.t = x.e.t). Since the ordering i prevents cycles, the resulting phylogeny p is indeed a tree.","Given the topics z, the ordering i, and the observed names, we choose an x.p value according to its posterior probability. This is proportional to w(x.p, x)","def","= Prφ(x.p | x) · Prθ(x.n | x.p.n), independent of any other mention’s choice of parent. The two factors here are given by (1) and (2) respectively.

(1) We fix topicsz0 via collapsed Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004). The sampler is run for 1000 iterations, and the final sampler state is taken to be z0.

Their method uses Jaro-Winkler string similarity to match names, then clusters mentions with matching names (for disambiguation) by comparing their unigram context distributions using the Jenson-Shannon metric. We also compare to the EXACT-MATCH baseline, which assigns all strings with the same name to the same entity. Procedure. We run four test experiments in which one split is used to pick model hyperparameters and the remaining three are used for test. For the discriminative baseline, we tune the string match threshold, context threshold, and the weight of the context model prior (all via grid search). For our model, we tune only the fixed weight of the root feature, which determines the precision/recall tradeoff (larger values of this feature result in more attachments to ♦ and hence more entities). We leave other hyperparameters fixed: 16 latent topics, and Gaussian priors N (0, 1) on all log-linear parameters. For PHYLO, the entity clustering is the result of (1) training the model using EM, (2) sampling from the posterior to obtain a distribution over clusterings, and (3) finding a consensus clustering. We use 20 iterations of EM with 100 samples per E-step for training, and use 1000 samples after training to estimate the posterior. We report results using three variations of our model: PHYLO does not consider mention context (all mentions effectively have the same topic) and determines mention entities from a single sample of p (the last); PHYLO+TOPIC adds context (§5.2); PHYLO+TOPIC+MBR uses the full posterior and consensus clustering to pick the output clustering (§7). Our results are shown in Table 1.10","10","Our single-threaded implementation took around 15 min-utes per fold of the Twitter corpus on a personal laptop with a 2.3 Ghz Intel Core i7 processor (including time required to parse the data files).

(2012). It is split into a development portion and a test portion. The baseline system took the first mention from each (gold) within-document coreference chain as the canonical mention, ignoring other mentions in the chain; we follow the same procedure in our experiments.11 Baselines & Procedure. We use the same baselines as in §8.1. On development data, modeling pragmatics as in §4.2 gave large improvements for organizations (8 points in F-measure), correcting the tendency to assume that short names like CIA were coincidental homonyms. Hence we allowed γ > 0 and tuned it on development data.12","Results are in Table 2. 8.3 Blogs Data. The CMU political blogs dataset consists of 3000 documents about U.S. politics (Yano et al., 2009). Preprocessed as described in Yogatama et al. (2012), the data consists of 10647 entity mentions. 11 That is, each within-document coreference chain is","mapped to a single mention as a preprocessing step. 12 We used only a simplified version of the pragmatic model,","approximating w(p′",", x) as 1 or 0 according to whether p′",".n =","x.n. We also omitted the IMH step from section 5.3. The","other results we report do not use pragmatics at all, since we","found that it gave only a slight improvement on Twitter. 782 Unlike our other datasets, mentions are not annotated with entities: the reference consists of a table of 126 entities, where each row is the canonical name of one entity. Baselines. We compare to the system results reported in Figure 2 of Yogatama et al. (2012). This includes a baseline hierarchical clustering approach, the “EEA” name canonicalization system of Eisenstein et al. (2011), as well the model proposed by Yogatama et al. (2012). Like the output of our model, the output of their hierarchical clustering baseline is a mention clustering, and therefore must be mapped to a table of canonical entity names to compare to the reference table. Procedure & Results We tune our method as in previous experiments, on the initialization data used by Yogatama et al. (2012) which consists of a subset of 700 documents of the full dataset. The tuned model then produced a mention clustering on the full political blog corpus. As the mapping from clusters to a table is not fully detailed in Yogatama et al. (2012), we used a simple heuristic: the most frequent name in each cluster is taken as the canonical name, augmented by any titles from a predefined list appearing in any other name in the cluster. The resulting table is then evaluated against the reference, as described in Yogatama et al. (2012). We achieved a response score of 0.17 and a reference score of 0.61. Though not state-of-the-art, this result is close to the score of the “EEA” system of Eisenstein et al. (2011), as reported in Figure 2 of Yogatama et al. (2012), which is specifically designed for the task of canonicalization. 8.4 Discussion On the Twitter dataset, we obtained a 12.6-point F1 improvement over the baseline. To understand our model’s behavior, we looked at the sampled phylogenetic trees on development data. One reason our model does well in this noisy domain is that it is able to relate seemingly dissimilar names via successive steps. For instance, our model learned to relate many variations of LL Cool J: Cool James LLCoJ El-El Cool John LL LL COOL JAMES LLCOOLJ In the sample we inspected, these mentions were also assigned the same topic, further boosting the probability of the configuration.","The ACE dataset, consisting of editorialized newswire, naturally contains less name variation than Twitter data. Nonetheless, we find that the variation that does appear is often properly handled by our model. For instance, we see several instances of variation due to transliteration that were all correctly grouped together, such as Megawati Soekarnoputri and Megawati Sukarnoputri. The pragmatic model was also effective in grouping common acronyms into the same entity.","We found that multiple samples tend to give different phylogenies (so the sampler is mobile), but essentially the same clustering into entities (which is why consensus clustering did not improve much over simply using the last sample). Random restarts of EM might create more variety by choosing different locally optimal parameter settings. It may also be beneficial to explore other sampling techniques (Bouchard-Côté, 2014).","Our method assembles observed names into an evolutionary tree. However, the true tree must in-clude many names that fall outside our small observed corpora, so our model would be a more appropriate fit for a far larger corpus. Larger corpora also offer stronger signals that might enable our Monte Carlo methods to mix faster and detect regularities more accurately.","A common error of our system is to connect mentions that share long substrings, such as different PERSONs who share a last name, or different ORGANIZATIONs that contain University of. A more powerful name mutation than the one we use here would recognize entire words, for example inserting a common title or replacing a first name with its common nickname. Modeling the internal structure of names (Johnson, 2010; Eisenstein et al., 2011; Yogatama et al., 2012) in the mutation model is a promising future direction."]},{"title":"9 Conclusions","paragraphs":["Our primary contribution consists of new modeling ideas, and associated inference techniques, for the problem of cross-document coreference resolution.
