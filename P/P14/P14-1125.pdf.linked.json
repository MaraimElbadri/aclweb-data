Chinese dependency trees were conventionally defined overwords (Chang et al., 2009; Li et al., 2012), requiring word segmentation and POS-tagging as pre-processing steps. Recent work on Chinese analysis has embarked on investigating the syntactic roles of characters, leading to large-scale annotations of word internal structures (Li, 2011; Zhang et al., 2013). Such annotations enable dependency parsing on the character level, building dependency trees over Chinese characters. Figure 1(c) shows an example of","∗","Corresponding author.","林业局 副局长 会 上 发言 forestry administration deputy director meeting in make a speech (a) a word-based dependency tree 林 业 局 副 局 长 会 上 发 言 woods industry office deputy office manager meeting in make speech (b) a character-level dependency tree by Zhao (2009) with real intra-word and pseudo inter-word dependencies 林 业 局 副 局 长 会 上 发 言 woods industry office deputy office manager meeting in make speech (c) a character-level dependency tree investigated in this paper with both real intra- and inter-word dependencies Figure 1: An example character-level dependency tree. “ 林业局副局长在大会上发言 (The deputy director of forestry administration make a speech in the meeting)”. a character-level dependency tree, where the leaf nodes are Chinese characters.","Character-level dependency parsing is interesting in at least two aspects. First, character-level trees circumvent the issue that no universal standard exists for Chinese word segmentation. In the well-known Chinese word segmentation bakeoff tasks, for example, different segmentation standards have been used by different data sets (Emerson, 2005). On the other hand, most disagreement on segmentation standards boils down to disagreement on segmentation granularity. As demonstrated by Zhao (2009), one can extract both fine-grained and coarse-grained words from character-level dependency trees, and hence can adapt to flexible segmentation standards using this formalism. In Figure 1(c), for example, “ 副局长 (deputy 1326 director)” can be segmented as both “ 副 (deputy) | 局 长 (director)” and “ 副 局 长 (deputy director)”, but not “ 副 (deputy) 局 (office) | 长 (manager)”, by dependency coherence. Chinese lan-guage processing tasks, such as machine translation, can benefit from flexible segmentation standards (Zhang et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2008).","Second, word internal structures can also be useful for syntactic parsing. Zhang et al. (2013) have shown the usefulness of word structures in Chinese constituent parsing. Their results on the Chinese Treebank (CTB) showed that character-level constituent parsing can bring increased performances even with the pseudo word structures. They further showed that better performances can be achieved when manually annotated word structures are used instead of pseudo structures.","In this paper, we make an investigation of character-level Chinese dependency parsing using Zhang et al. (2013)’s annotations and based on a transition-based parsing framework (Zhang and Clark, 2011). There are two dominant transition-based dependency parsing systems, namely the arc-standard and the arc-eager parsers (Nivre, 2008). We study both algorithms for character-level dependency parsing in order to make a comprehensive investigation. For direct comparison with word-based parsers, we incorporate the traditional word segmentation, POS-tagging and dependency parsing stages in our joint parsing models. We make changes to the original transition systems, and arrive at two novel transition-based character-level parsers.","We conduct experiments on three data sets, including CTB 5.0, CTB 6.0 and CTB 7.0. Experimental results show that the character-level dependency parsing models outperform the word-based methods on all the data sets. Moreover, manually annotated intra-word dependencies can give improved word-level dependency accuracies than pseudo intra-word dependencies. These results confirm the usefulness of character-level syntax for Chinese analysis.

They show that by annotat-ing character dependencies within words, one can adapt to different segmentation standards. The dependencies they study are restricted to intra-word characters, as illustrated in Figure 1(b). For inter-word dependencies, they use a pseudo right-headed representation.","In this study, we integrate inter-word syntactic dependencies and intra-word dependencies using large-scale annotations of word internal structures by Zhang et al. (2013), and study their interactions. We extract unlabeled dependencies from bracketed word structures according to Zhang et al.’s head annotations. In Figure 1(c), the dependencies shown by dashed arcs are intra-word dependencies, which reflect the internal word structures, while the dependencies with solid arcs are inter-word dependencies, which reflect the syntactic structures between words.","In this formulation, a character-level dependency tree satisfies the same constraints as the traditional word-based dependency tree for Chinese, including projectivity. We differentiate intra-word dependencies and inter-word dependencies by the arc type, so that our work can be compared with conventional word segmentation, POS-tagging and dependency parsing pipelines under a canonical segmentation standard.","The character-level dependency trees hold to a specific word segmentation standard, but are not limited to it. We can extract finer-grained words of different granulities from a coarse-grained word by taking projective subtrees of different sizes. For example, taking all the intra-word modifier nodes of “ 长 (manager)” in Figure 1(c) results in the word “ 副局长 (deputy director)”, while taking the first modifier node of “长 (manager)” results in the word “ 局长 (director)”. Note that “ 副局 (deputy office)” cannot be a word because it does not form a projective span without “ 长 (manager)”.","Inner-word dependencies can also bring benefits to parsing word-level dependencies. The head character can be a less sparse feature compared to a word. As intra-word dependencies lead to fine-grained subwords, we can also use these subwords for better parsing. In this work, we use the innermost left/right subwords as atomic features. To extract the subwords, we find the innermost left/right modifiers of the head character, respectively, and then conjoin them with all their descendant characters to form the smallest left/right subwords. Figure 2 shows an example, where the smallest left subword of “ 大法官 (chief lawyer)” is “ 法官 (lawyer)”, and the smallest right subword 1327 大 法 官 big law officer (a) smallest left subword","合 法 化 agree with law ize (b) smallest right subword Figure 2: An example to illustrate the innermost left/right subwords. of “ 合法化 (legalize)” is “ 合法 (legal)”."]},{"title":"3 Character-Level Dependency Parsing","paragraphs":["A transition-based framework with global learn-ing and beam search decoding (Zhang and Clark, 2011) has been applied to a number of natural lan-guage processing tasks, including word segmentation, POS-tagging and syntactic parsing (Zhang and Clark, 2010; Huang and Sagae, 2010; Bohnet and Nivre, 2012; Zhang et al., 2013). It models a task incrementally from a start state to an end state, where each intermediate state during decoding can be regarded as a partial output. A number of actions are defined so that the state advances step by step. To learn the model parameters, it usually uses the online perceptron algorithm with early-update under the inexact decoding condition (Collins, 2002; Collins and Roark, 2004). Transition-based dependency parsing can be modeled under this framework, where the state consists of a stack and a queue, and the set of actions can be either the arc-eager (Zhang and Clark, 2008) or the arc-standard (Huang et al., 2009) transition systems.","When the internal structures of words are annotated, character-level dependency parsing can be treated as a special case of word-level dependency parsing, with “words” being “characters”. A big weakness of this approach is that full words and POS-tags cannot be used for feature engineer-ing. Both are crucial to well-established features for word segmentation, POS-tagging and syntactic parsing. In this section, we introduce novel extensions to the arc-standard and the arc-eager transition systems, so that word-based and character-based features can be used simultaneously for character-level dependency parsing. 3.1 The Arc-Standard Model The arc-standard model has been applied to joint segmentation, POS-tagging and dependency parsing (Hatori et al., 2012), but with pseudo word structures. For unified processing of annotated word structures and fair comparison between character-level arc-eager and arc-standard systems, we define a different arc-standard transition system, consistent with our character-level arc-eager system.","In the word-based arc-standard model, the transition state includes a stack and a queue, where the stack contains a sequence of partially-parsed dependency trees, and the queue consists of unprocessed input words. Four actions are defined for state transition, including arc-left (AL, which creates a left arc between the top element s0 and the second top element s1 on the stack), arc-right (AR, which creates a right arc between s0 and s1), pop-root (PR, which defines the root node of a dependency tree when there is only one element on the stack and no element in the queue), and the last shift (SH, which shifts the first element q0 of the queue onto the stack).","For character-level dependency parsing, there are two types of dependencies: inter-word dependencies and intra-word dependencies. To parse them with both character and word features, we extend the original transition actions into two categories, for inter-word dependencies and intra-word dependencies, respectively. The actions for inter-word dependencies include inter-word arc-left (ALw), inter-word arc-right (ARw), pop-root (PR) and inter-word shift (SHw). Their definitions are the same as the word-based model, with one exception that the inter-word shift operation has a parameter denoting the POS-tag of the incoming word, so that POS disambiguation is performed by the SHw action.","The actions for intra-word dependencies include intra-word arc-left (ALc), intra-word arc-right (ARc), pop-word (PW) and inter-word shift (SHc). The definitions of ALc, ARc and SHc are the same as the word-based arc-standard model, while PW changes the top element on the stack into a full-word node, which can only take inter-word dependencies. One thing to note is that, due to variable word sizes in character-level parsing, the number of actions can vary between different sequences of actions corresponding to different analyses. We use the padding method (Zhu et al., 2013), adding an IDLE action to finished transition action sequences, for better alignments between states in the beam.

The inter-word actions can be applied when all the elements on the stack are full-word nodes, while the intra-word actions can be applied when at least the top element on the stack is a partial-word node. For the actions ALc and ARc to be valid, the top two elements on the stack are both partial-word nodes. For the action PW to be valid, only the top element on the stack is a partial-word node. Figure 3(a) gives an example action sequence.","There are three types of features. The first two types are traditionally established features for the dependency parsing and joint word segmentation and POS-tagging tasks. We use the features proposed by Hatori et al. (2012). The word-level dependency parsing features are added when the inter-word actions are applied, and the features for joint word segmentation and POS-tagging are added when the actions PW, SHw and SHc are applied. Following the work of Hatori et al. (2012), we have a parameter α to adjust the weights for joint word segmentation and POS-tagging features. We apply word-based dependency parsing features to intra-word dependency parsing as well, by using subwords (the conjunction of characters spanning the head node) to replace words in word features. The third type of features is word-structure features. We extract the head character and the smallest subwords containing the head character from the intra-word dependencies (Sec-tion 2). Table 1 summarizes the features. 3.2 The Arc-Eager Model Similar to the arc-standard case, the state of a word-based arc-eager model consists of a stack and a queue, where the stack contains a sequence of partial dependency trees, and the queue consists of unprocessed input words. Unlike the arc-standard model, which builds dependencies on the top two elements on the stack, the arc-eager model builds dependencies between the top element of the stack and the first element of the queue. Five actions are defined for state transformation: arc-left (AL, which creates a left arc between the top element of the stack s0 and the first element in the queue q0, while popping s0 off the stack), arc-right (AR, which creates a right arc between 1329 Feature templates Lc, Lct, Rc, Rct, Llc1c, Lrc1c, Rlc1c, Lc · Rc, Llc1ct, Lrc1ct, Rlc1ct, Lc · Rw, Lw · Rc, Lct · Rw, Lw t · Rc, Lw · Rct, Lc · Rw t, Lc · Rc · Llc1c, Lc · Rc · Lrc1c, Lc · Rc · Llc2c, Lc · Rc · Lrc2c, Lc · Rc · Rlc1c, Lc · Rc · Rlc2c, Llsw, Lrsw, Rlsw, Rrsw, Llsw t, Lrsw t, Rlsw t, Rrsw t, Llsw · Rw, Lrsw · Rw, Lw · Rlsw, Lw · Rrsw Table 1: Feature templates encoding intra-word dependencies. L and R denote the two elements over which the dependencies are built; the subscripts lc1 and rc1 denote the left-most and right-most children, respectively; the subscripts lc2 and rc2 denote the second left-most and second right-most children, respectively; w denotes the word; t denotes the POS tag; c denotes the head character; lsw and rsw denote the smallest left and right subwords respectively, as shown in Figure 2. s0 and q0, while shifting q0 from the queue onto the stack), pop-root (PR, which defines the ROOT node of the dependency tree when there is only one element on the stack and no element in the queue), reduce (RD, which pops s0 off the stack), and shift (SH, which shifts q0 onto the stack).","There is no previous work that exploits the arc-eager algorithm for jointly performing POS-tagging and dependency parsing. Since the first element of the queue can be shifted onto the stack by either SH or AR, it is more difficult to assign a POS tag to each word by using a single action. In this work, we make a change to the configuration state, adding a deque between the stack and the queue to save partial words with intra-word dependencies. We divide the transition actions into two categories, one for inter-word dependencies (ARw, ALw, SHw, RDw and PR) and the other for intra-word dependencies (ARc, ALc, SHc, RDc and PW), requiring that the intra-word actions be operated between the deque and the queue, while the inter-word actions be operated between the stack and the deque.","For character-level arc-eager dependency parsing, the inter-word actions are the same as the word-based methods. The actions ALc and ARc are the same as ALw and ARw, except that they operate on characters, but the SHc operation has a parameter to denote the POS tag of a word. The PW action recognizes a full-word. We also have an IDLE action, for the same reason as the arc-standard model.","In the character-level arc-eager transition system, a word is formed in a similar way with that of character-level arc-standard algorithm. Each word is initialized by the action SHc with a POS tag, and then incrementally changed a sequence of intra-word actions, before being finalized by the action PW. All these actions operate between the queue and deque. For the action PW, only the first element in the deque (close to the queue) is a partial-word node. For the actions ARc and ALc to be valid, the first element in the deque must be a partial-word node. The action SHc have a POS tag when shifting the first character of a word,but does not have such a parameter when shifting the next characters of a word. For the action SHc with a POS tag to be valid, the first element in the deque must be a full-word node. Different from the arc-standard model, at any stage we can choose either the action SHc with a POS tag to initialize a new word on the deque, or the inter-word actions on the stack. In order to eliminate the ambiguity, we define a new parameter t to limit the max size of the deque. If the deque is full with t words, inter-word actions are performed; otherwise intra-word actions are performed. All the inter-word actions must be applied on full-word nodes between the stack an the deque. Figure 3(b) gives an example action sequence.","Similar to the arc-standard case, there are three types of features, with the first two types being traditionally established features for dependency parsing and joint word segmentation and POS-tagging. The dependency parsing features are taken from the work of Zhang and Nivre (2011), and the features for joint word segmentation and POS-tagging are taken from Zhang and Clark (2010)1",". The word-level dependency parsing features are triggered when the inter-word actions are applied, while the features of joint word segmentation and POS-tagging are added when the actions SHc, ARc and PW are applied. Again we use a parameter α to adjust the weights for joint word segmentation and POS-tagging features. The word-level features for dependency parsing are applied to intra-word dependency parsing as well, by using subwords to replace words. The third type of features is word-structure features, which are the","1","Since Hatori et al.

A comparison between them (STD/EAG (pipe) vs. STD/EAG (real, pseudo)) reflects the effectiveness of annotated intra-word dependencies on segmentation and POS-tagging. We can see that both the arc-standard and arc-eager models with annotated intra-word dependencies can improve the segmentation accuracies by 0.3% and the POS-tagging accuracies by 0.5% on average on the three datasets. Similarly, a comparison between the character-level models with pseudo inter-word dependencies and the character-level models with real inter-word dependencies (STD/EAG (real, pseudo) vs. STD/EAG (real, real)) can reflect the effectiveness of annotated inter-word structures on morphology analysis. We can see that improved POS-tagging accuracies are achieved using the real inter-word dependencies when jointly performing inner- and inter-word dependencies. However, we find that the inter-word dependencies do not help the word-structure accuracies. 4.5 Analysis To better understand the character-level parsing models, we conduct error analysis in this section. All the experiments are conducted on the CTB60 test data sets. The new advantage of the character-level models is that one can parse the internal word structures of intra-word dependencies. Thus we are interested in their capabilities of predict-ing word structures. We study the word-structure accuracies in two aspects, including OOV, word length, POS tags and the parsing model. 4.5.1 OOV The word-structure accuracy of OOV words reflects a model’s ability of handling unknown words. The overall recalls of OOV word structures are 67.98% by STD (real, real) and 69.01% by EAG (real, real), respectively. We find that most errors are caused by failures of word segmentation. We further investigate the accuracies when words are correctly segmented, where the accuracies of OOV word structures are 87.64% by STD (real, real) and 89.07% by EAG (real, real). The results demonstrate that the structures of Chinese words are not difficult to predict, and confirm the fact that Chinese word structures have some common syntactic patterns. 4.5.2 Parsing Model From the above analysis in terms of OOV, word lengths and POS tags, we can see that the EAG (real, real) model and the STD (real, real) models behave similarly on word-structure accuracies. Here we study the two models more carefully, comparing their word accuracies sentence by sentence. Figure 4 shows the results, where each point denotes a sentential comparison between STD (real, real) and EAG (real, real), the x-axis denotes the sentential word-structure accuracy of STD (real, real), and the y-axis denotes that of EAG (real, real). The points at the diagonal show the same accuracies by the two models, while others show that the two models perform differently on the corresponding sentences. We can see that most points are beyond the diagonal line, indicat-1333 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 10.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 STD (real, real) EA G (r eal, r eal) Figure 4: Sentential word-structure accuracies of STD (real, real) and EAG (real, real). ing that the two parsing models can be complementary in parsing intra-word dependencies."]},{"title":"5 Related Work","paragraphs":["Zhao (2009) was the first to study character-level dependencies; they argue that since no consistent word boundaries exist over Chinese word segmentation, dependency-based representations of word structures serve as a good alternative for Chinese word segmentation. Thus their main concern is to parse intra-word dependencies. In this work, we extend their formulation, making use of large-scale annotations of Zhang et al. (2013), so that the syntactic word-level dependencies can be parsed together with intra-word dependencies.","Hatori et al. (2012) proposed a joint model for Chinese word segmentation, POS-tagging and dependency parsing, studying the influence of joint model and character features for parsing, Their model is extended from the arc-standard transition-based model, and can be regarded as an alternative to the arc-standard model of our work when pseudo intra-word dependencies are used. Similar work is done by Li and Zhou (2012). Our proposed arc-standard model is more concise while obtaining better performance than Hatori et al. (2012)’s work. With respect to word structures, real intra-word dependencies are often more complicated, while pseudo word structures cannot be used to correctly guide segmentation.","Zhao (2009), Hatori et al. (2012) and our work all study character-level dependency parsing. While Zhao (2009) focus on word internal structures using pseudo inter-word dependencies, Hatori et al. (2012) investigate a joint model using pseudo intra-word dependencies. We use manual dependencies for both inner- and inter-word structures, studying their influences on each other.","Zhang et al. (2013) was the first to perform Chinese syntactic parsing over characters. They extended word-level constituent trees by annotated word structures, and proposed a transition-based approach to parse intra-word structures and word-level constituent structures jointly. For Hebrew, Tsarfaty and Goldberg (2008) investigated joint segmentation and parsing over characters using a graph-based method. Our work is similar in exploiting character-level syntax. We study the dependency grammar, another popular syntactic representation, and propose two novel transition systems for character-level dependency parsing.","Nivre (2008) gave a systematic description of the arc-standard and arc-eager algorithms, currently two popular transition-based parsing methods for word-level dependency parsing. We extend both algorithms to character-level joint word segmentation, POS-tagging and dependency parsing. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply the arc-eager system to joint models and achieve comparative performances to the arc-standard model."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We studied the character-level Chinese dependency parsing, by making novel extensions to two commonly-used transition-based dependency parsing algorithms for word-based dependency parsing. With both pseudo and annotated word structures, our character-level models obtained better accuracies than previous work on segmentation, POS-tagging and word-level dependency parsing. We further analyzed some important factors for intra-word dependencies, and found that two proposed character-level parsing models are complementary in parsing intra-word dependencies.
