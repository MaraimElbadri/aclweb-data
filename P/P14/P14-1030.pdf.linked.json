Opinion targets are objects about which users’ opinions are expressed, and opinion words are words which indicate opinions’ polarities. Extracting them can provide essential information for obtaining fine-grained analysis on customers’ opinions. Thus, it has attracted a lot of attentions (Hu and Liu, 2004b; Liu et al., 2012; Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012).","To this end, previous work usually employed a collective extraction strategy (Qiu et al., 2009; Hu and Liu, 2004b; Liu et al., 2013b). Their intuition is: opinion words usually co-occur with opinion targets in sentences, and there are strong modification relationship between them (called opinion relation in (Liu et al., 2012)). If a word is an opinion word, other words with which that word having opinion relations will have highly probability to be opinion targets, and vice versa. In this way, extraction is alternatively performed and mutual reinforced between opinion targets and opinion words. Although this strategy has been widely employed by previous approaches, it still has several limitations.","1) Only considering opinion relations is insufficient. Previous methods mainly focused on employing opinion relations among words for opinion target/word co-extraction. They have in-vestigated a series of techniques to enhance opinion relations identification performance, such as nearest neighbor rules (Liu et al., 2005), syntactic patterns (Zhang et al., 2010; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), word alignment models (Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013b; Liu et al., 2013a), etc. However, we are curious that whether merely employing opinion relations among words is enough for opinion target/word extraction? We note that there are additional types of relations among words. For example, “LCD” and “LED” both denote the same aspect “screen” in TV set domain, and they are topical related. We call such relations between homogeneous words as semantic relations. If we have known “LCD” to be an opinion target, “LED” is naturally to be an opinion target. Intuitively, besides opinion relations, semantic relations may provide additional rich clues for indicating opinion targets/words. Which kind of relations is more effective for opinion targets/words extraction? Is it beneficial to consider these two types of relations together for the extraction? To our best knowl-314 edge, these problems have seldom been studied before (see Section 2).","2) Ignoring word preference. When employing opinion relations to perform mutual reinforc-ing extraction between opinion targets and opinion words, previous methods depended on opinion associations among words, but seldom considered word preference. Word preference denotes a word’s preferred collocations. Intuitively, the confidence of a candidate being an opinion target (opinion word) should mostly be determined by its word preferences rather than all words having opinion relations with it. For example","“This camera’s price is expensive for me.”","“It’s price is good.”","“Canon 40D has a good price.” In these three sentences, “price” is modified by “good” more times than “expensive”. In traditional extraction strategy, opinion associations are usually computed based on the co-occurrence frequency. Thus, “good” has more strong opinion association with “price” than “expensive”, and it would have more contributions on determining “price” to be an opinion target or not. It’s unreasonable. “Expensive” actually has more relatedness with “price” than “good”, and “expensive” is likely to be a word preference for “price”. The confidence of “price” being an opinion target should be influenced by “expensive” in greater extent than “good”. In this way, we argue that the extraction will be more precise.

T C means opinion target candidates. Solid curves and dotted lines respectively mean semantic relations and opinion relations between two candidates.","Thus, to resolve these two problems, we present a novel approach with graph co-ranking. The collective extraction of opinion targets/words is performed in a co-ranking process. First, we operate over a heterogeneous graph to model semantic relations and opinion relations into a unified model. Specifically, our heterogeneous graph is composed of three subgraphs which model different relation types and candidates, as shown in Figure 1. The first subgraph Gtt","represents semantic relations among opinion target candidates, and the second subgraph Goo","models semantic relations among opinion word candidates. The third part is a bipartite subgraph Gto",", which models opinion relations among different candidate types and connects the above two subgraphs together. Then we perform a random walk algorithm on Gtt",", Goo","and Gto","separately, to estimate all candidates’ confidence, and the entries with higher confidence than a threshold are correspondingly extracted as opinion targets/words. The results could reflect which type of relation is more useful for the extraction.","Second, a co-ranking algorithm, which incorporates three separate random walks on Gtt",", Goo and Gto","into a unified process, is proposed to perform candidate confidence estimation. Different relations may cooperatively affect candidate confidence estimation and generate more global ranking results. Moreover, we discover each candidate’s preferences through topics. Such word preference will be different for different candidates. We add word preference information into our algorithm and make our co-ranking algorithm be personalized. A candidate’s confidence would mainly absorb the contributions from its word preferences rather than its all neighbors with opinion relations, which may be beneficial for improv-ing extraction precision.","We perform experiments on real-world datasets from different languages and different domains. Results show that our approach effectively improves extraction performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["There are many significant research efforts on opinion targets/words extraction (sentence level and corpus level). In sentence level extraction, previous methods (Wu et al., 2009; Ma and Wan, 2010; Li et al., 2010; Yang and Cardie, 2013) mainly aimed to identify all opinion target/word mentions in sentences. They regarded it as a sequence labeling task, where several classical models were used, such as CRFs (Li et al., 2010) and SVM (Wu et al., 2009).","This paper belongs to corpus level extraction, and aims to generate a sentiment lexicon and a target list rather than to identify mentions in sen-315 tences. Most of previous corpus-level methods adopted a co-extraction framework, where opinion targets and opinion words reinforce each other according to their opinion relations. Thus, how to improve opinion relations identification performance was their main focus. (Hu and Liu, 2004a) exploited nearest neighbor rules to mine opinion relations among words. (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) and (Qiu et al., 2011) designed syntactic patterns to perform this task. (Zhang et al., 2010) promoted Qiu’s method. They adopted some special designed patterns to increase recall. (Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013a; Liu et al., 2013b) employed word alignment model to capture opinion relations rather than syntactic parsing. The experimental results showed that these alignment-based methods are more effective than syntax-based approaches for online informal texts. However, all aforementioned methods only employed opinion relations for the extraction, but ignore considering semantic relations among homogeneous candidates. Moreover, they all ignored word preference in the extraction process.","In terms of considering semantic relations among words, our method is related with several approaches based on topic model (Zhao et al., 2010; Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Moghaddam and Ester, 2012a; Moghaddam and Ester, 2012b; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012). The main goals of these methods weren’t to extract opinion targets/words, but to categorize all given aspect terms and sentiment words. Although these models could be used for our task according to the associations between candidates and topics, solely employing semantic relations is still one-sided and insufficient to obtain expected performance.","Furthermore, there is little work which considered these two types of relations globally (Su et al., 2008; Hai et al., 2012; Bross and Ehrig, 2013). They usually captured different relations using co-occurrence information. That was too coarse to obtain expected results (Liu et al., 2012). In addition, (Hai et al., 2012) extracted opinion targets/words in a bootstrapping process, which had an error propagation problem. In contrast, we perform extraction with a global graph co-ranking process, where error propagation can be effectively alleviated. (Su et al., 2008) used heterogeneous relations to find implicit sentiment associations among words. Their aim was only to perform aspect terms categorization but not to extract opinion targets/words. They extracted opinion targets/words in advanced through simple phrase detection. Thus, the extraction performance is far from expectation."]},{"title":"3 The Proposed Method","paragraphs":["In this section, we propose our method in detail. We formulate opinion targets/words extraction as a co-ranking task. All nouns/noun phrases are regarded as opinion target candidates, and all adjectives/verbs are regarded as opinion word candidates, which are widely adopted by pervious methods (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Qiu et al., 2011; Wang and Wang, 2008; Liu et al., 2012). Then each candidate will be assigned a confidence and ranked, and the candidates with higher confidence than a threshold will be extracted as the results.","Different from traditional methods, besides opinion relations among words, we additionally capture semantic relations among homogeneous candidates. To this end, a heterogeneous undirected graph G = (V, E) is constructed. V = V t","∪ V o","denotes the vertex set, which includes opinion target candidates vt","∈ V t","and opinion word candidates vo","∈ V o",". E denotes the edge set, where eij ∈ E means that there is a relation between two vertices. Ett","⊂ E represents the semantic relations between two opinion target candidates. Eoo","⊂ E represents the semantic relations between two opinion word candidates. Eto","⊂ E represents the opinion relations between opinion target candidates and opinion word candidates. Based on different relation types, we used three matrices Mtt ∈ R|V t","|×|V t","|",", Moo ∈ R|V o |×|V o","|","and Mto ∈ R|V t |×|V o","|","to record the association weights between any two vertices, respectively. Section 3.4 will illustrate how to construct them. 3.1 Only Considering Opinion Relations To estimate the confidence of each candidate, we use a random walk algorithm on our graph to perform co-ranking. Most previous methods (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Qiu et al., 2011; Wang and Wang, 2008; Liu et al., 2012) only considered opinion relations among words. Their basic assumption is as follows. Assumption 1: If a word is likely to be an opinion word, the words which it has opinion relation with will have higher confidence to be opinion targets, and vice versa. 316","In this way, candidates’ confidences (vt","or vo",") are","collectively determined by each other iteratively.","It equals to making random walk on subgraph","Gto","= (V, Eto",") of G. Thus we have Ct = (1 − μ) × Mto × Co + μ × It Co = (1 − μ) × M T","to × Ct + μ × Io (1) where Ct and Co respectively represent confidences of opinion targets and opinion words. mto","i,j ∈ Mto means the association weight between the ith opinion target and the jth opinion word according to their opinion relations.","It’s worthy noting that It and Io respectively denote prior confidences of opinion target candidates and opinion word candidates. We argue that opinion targets are usually domain-specific, and there are remarkably distribution difference of them on different domains (in-domain Din vs. out-domain Dout). If a candidate is salient in Din but common in Dout, it’s likely to be an opinion target in Din. Thus, we use a domain relevance measure (DR) (Hai et al., 2013) to compute It. DR(t) = R(t, Din) R(t, Dout) (2)","where R(t, D) = w̄t st ×","∑N j=1(wtj − 1","Wj × ∑Wj","k=1 wkj) represents candidate relevance with domain D. wtj = (1 + logT Ftj) × log N","DFt is a TF-IDF-like weight of candidate t in document j. T Ftj is the frequency of the candidate t in the jth document, and DFt is document frequency. N means the document number in domain D. R(t, D) includes two measures to reflect the salient of a candidate in D. 1) wtj − 1","Wj ×","∑Wj","k=1 wkj reflects how frequently a","term is mentioned in a particular document. Wj","denotes the word number in document j. 2) w̄t","st","quantifies how significantly a term is mentioned","across all documents in D. w̄t = 1","N × ∑N","k=1 wtk","denotes average weight across all documents for t. st = √ 1 N × ∑N","j=1 (wtj − w̄j)2","denotes the","standard variance of term t. We use the given","reviews as in-domain collection Din and Google","n-gram corpus1 as out-domain collection D","out. Finally, each entry in It is a normalized DR(t) score. In contrast, opinion words are usually domain-independent. Users may use same words to express theirs opinions, like “good”, “bad”, etc. But there are still some domain-dependent opinion","1","http://books.google.com/ngrams/datasets words, like “delicious” in the restaurant domain, “powerful” in the car domain. It’s difficult to discriminate them from other words by using statisti-cal information. So we simply set all entries in Io to be 1. μ ∈ [0, 1] in Eq.1 determines the impact of the prior confidence on results. 3.2 Only Considering Semantic Relations To estimate candidates’ confidences by only considering semantic relations among words, we make two separately random walks on the subgraphs of G, Gtt","= (V, Ett",") and Goo","= (V, Eoo","). The basic assumption is as follows: Assumption 2: If a word is likely to be an opinion target (opinion word), the words which it has strong semantic relation with will have higher confidence to be opinion targets (opinion words). In this way, the confidence of the candidate is determined only by its homogeneous neighbours. There is no mutual reinforcement between opinion targets and opinion words. Thus we have Ct = (1 − ν) × Mtt × Ct + ν × It Co = (1 − ν) × Moo × Co + ν × Io (3) where ν has the same role as μ in Eq.1.","3.3 Considering Semantic Relations and Opinion Relations Together To jointly model semantic relations and opinion relations for opinion targets/words extraction, we couple two random walking algorithms mentioned above together. Here, Assumption 1 and Assumption 2 are both satisfied. Thus, an opinion target/word candidate’s confidence is collectively determined by its neighbours according to different relation types. Meanwhile, each item may make influence on it’s neighbours. It’s an iterative reinforcement process. Thus, we have Ct = (1 − λ − μ) × Mto × Co + λ × Mtt × Ct + μ × It","Co = (1 − λ − μ) × M T","to × Ct + λ × Moo × Co + μ × Io (4) where λ ∈ [0, 1] determines which type of relations dominates candidate confidence estimation. λ = 0 means that each candidate’s confidence is estimated by only considering opinion relations among words, which equals to Eq.1. Otherwise, when λ = 1, candidate confidence estimation only 317 considers semantic relations among words, which equals to Eq.3. μ, Io and It have the same meaning in Eq.1. Our algorithm will run iteratively until it converges or in a fixed iteration number Iter. In experiments, we set Iter = 200.","Obtaining Word Preference. The co-ranking algorithm in Eq.4 is based on a standard random walking algorithm, which randomly selects a link according to the association matrix Mto, Mtt and Moo, or jumps to a random node with prior confidence value. However, it generates a global ranking over all candidates without taking the node preference (word preference) into account. As mentioned in the first section, each opinion target/word has its preferred collocations, it’s reasonable that the confidence of an opinion target (opinion word) candidate should be preferentially determined by its preferences, rather than all of its neighbors with opinion relations.","To obtain the word preference, we resort to topics. We believe that if an opinion word vio","is topical related with a target word vjt",", v i","o","can be regarded as a word preference for vjt",", and vice versa. For example, “price” and “expensive” are topically related in phone’s domain, so they are a word preference for each other. Specifically, we use a vector P Ti","= [P Ti 1 , ..., P Ti","k , ..., P Ti","|V o","|]1×|V o","| to represent word preference of the ith opinion target candidate. P Ti k means the preferred probability of the ith potential opinion target for the kth potential opinion words. To compute P Ti","k , we first use Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure the semantic distance between any two candidates on the bridge of topics. Thus, we have D(vi, vj) = 1 2 Σz(KLz(vi||vj) + KLz(vj||vi)) where KLz(vi||vj) = p(z|vi)log","p(z|vi)","p(z|vj) means the","KL-divergence from candidate vi to vj based on","topic z. p(z|v) = p(v|z)","p(z)","p(v) , where p(v|z) is the probability of the candidate v to topic z (see Section 3.4). p(z) is the probability that topic z in reviews. p(v) is the probability that a candidate occurs in reviews. Then, a logistic function is used to map D(vi, vj) into [0, 1]. SA(vi, vj) =","1 1 + eD(vi,vj) (5)","Then, we calculate P Ti k by normalize SA(vi, vj)","score, i.e. P Ti k =","SA(vt i,vo","k)","∑|V o |","p=1 SA(vt","i,vo","p) . For demonstration, we give some examples in Table 1, where each entry denotes a SA(vi, vj) score between two candidates. We can see that using topics can successfully capture the preference information for each opinion target/word.","expensive good long colorful price 0.265 0.043 0.003 0.000 LED 0.002 0.035 0.007 0.098 battery 0.000 0.015 0.159 0.001 Table 1: Examples of Calculated Word Preference","And we use a vector P Oj = [P Oj 1 , ..., P Oj q , ..., P Oj |V t","|]1×|V t","| to represent","the preference information of the jth opin-","ion word candidate. Similarly, we have P Oj q =","SA(vt q,vo","j )","∑|V t |","k=1 SA(vt","k,vo","j ) .","Incorporating Word Preference into Co-ranking. To consider such word preference in our co-ranking algorithm, we incorporate it into the random walking on Gto",". Intuitively, preference vectors will be different for different candidates. Thus, the co-ranking algorithm would be personalized. It allows that the candidate confidence propagates to other candidates only in its preference cluster. Specifically, we make modification on original transition matrix Mto = (M to","1 , M to","2 , ..., M to","|V t","|) and add each candidate’s preference in it. Let M̂to = ( M̂ to","1 , M̂ to","2 , ..., M̂ to","|V t","|) be the modified transition matrix, which records the associations between opinion target candidates and opinion word candidates. Here M to","k ∈","R1×|V o |","and M̂ to k ∈ R1×|V o","|","denotes the kth col-","umn vector in Mto and M̂to, respectively. And","let Diag(P Tk",") denote a diagonal matrix whose","eigenvalue is vector P Tk",", we have","M̂ to","k = M to","k Diag(P Tk",")","Similarly, let U to k ∈ R1×|V t","|","and Û to k ∈ R1×|V t","|","denotes the kth row vector in M T","to and M̂ T","to, re-","spectively.

Then we have","Û to","k = U to","k Diag(P Ok",")","In this way, each candidate’s preference is incorporated into original associations based on opinion relation Mto through Diag(P Ok",") and Diag(P Tk","). And candidates’ confidences will mainly come from the contributions of its preferences. Thus, Ct and Co in Eq.4 become: 318 Ct = (1 − λ − μ) × M̂to × Co + λ × Mtt × Ct + μ × It","Co = (1 − λ − μ) × M̂ T","to × Ct + λ × Moo × Co + μ × Io (6)","3.4 Capturing Semantic and Opinion Relations In this section, we explain how to capture semantic relations and opinion relations for constructing transition matrices Mtt, Moo and Mto.","Capturing Semantic Relations: For capturing semantic relations among homogenous candidates, we employ topics. We believe that if two candidates share similar topics in the corpus, there is a strong semantic relation between them. Thus, we employ a LDA variation (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012), an extension of (Zhao et al., 2010), to discover topic distribution on words, which sampled all words into two separated observations: opinion targets and opinion words. It’s because that we are only interested in topic distribution of opinion targets/words, regardless of other useless words, including conjunctions, prepositions etc. This model has been proven to be better than the standard LDA model and other LDA variations for opinion mining (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012).","After topic modeling, we obtain the probability of the candidates (vt","and vo",") to topic z, i.e. p(z|vt",") and p(z|vo","), and topic distribution p(z). Then, a symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence as same as Eq.5 is used to calculate the semantical associations between any two homogenous candidates. Thus, we obtain SA(vt",", vt",") and SA(vo",", vo","), which correspond to the entries in Mtt and Moo, respectively.","Capturing Opinion Relations: To capture opinion relations among words and construct the transition matrix Mto, we used an alignment-based method proposed in (Liu et al., 2013b). This approach models capturing opinion relations as a monolingual word alignment process. Each opinion target can find its corresponding modifiers in sentences through alignment, in which multiple factors are considered globally, such as co-occurrence information, word position in sentence, etc. Moreover, this model adopted a partially supervised framework to combine syntactic information with alignment results, which has been proven to be more precise than the state-of-the-art approaches for opinion relations identification (Liu et al., 2013b).","After performing word alignment, we obtain a set of word pairs composed of a noun (noun phrase) and its corresponding modified word. Then, we simply employ Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to calculate the opinion associations among words as the entries in Mto.

In contrast, besides opinion relations, CR and CR WP further take semantic relations into account. Thus, more opinion targets/words can be extracted. Furthermore, we observe that CR and CR WP outperform SAS. SAS only exploits semantic relations, but ignores opinion relations among words. Its extraction is performed separately and neglects the reinforcement between opinion targets and opinion words. Thus, SAS has worse performance than our methods.

We believe the reasons are as follows. First, CR and CR WP considers multiple relations in a unified process by using graph co-ranking. In contrast, Hai adopts a bootstrapping framework which performs extraction step by step and may have the problem of error propagation. It demonstrates that our graph co-ranking is more suitable for this task than bootstrapping-based strategy. Second, our method captures semantic relations using topic modeling and captures opinion relations through word alignments, which are more precise than Hai which merely uses co-occurrence information to indicate such relations among words. In addition, word preference is not handled in Hai, but processed in CR WP. The results show the usefulness of word preference for opinion targets/words extraction.","4) CR WP outperforms CR, especially on precision. The only difference between them is that CR WP considers word preference when performing graph ranking for candidate confidence estimation, but CR does not. Each candidate confidence estimation in CR WP gives more weights for this candidate’s preferred words than CR. Thus, the precision can be improved. 4.3 Semantic Relation vs. Opinion Relation In this section, we discuss which relation type is more effective for this task. For comparison, we design two baselines, called OnlySA and OnlyOA. OnlyOA only employs opinion relations among words, which equals to Eq.1. OnlySA only employs semantic relations among words, which equals to Eq.3.

And it is necessary to utilize the mutual reinforcement relationship between opinion words and opinion targets. Moreover, Combine outperforms OnlySA and OnlyOA in all domains. It indicates that combining different relations among words together is effective.","4.4 The Effectiveness of Considering Word Preference In this section, we try to prove the necessity of considering word preference in Eq.6. Besides the comparison between CR and CR WP performed 321 in the main experiment in Section 4.2, we further incorporate word preference in aforementioned OnlyOA, named as OnlyOA WP, which only employs opinion relations among words and equals to Eq.6 with λ = 0. Experimental results are shown in Figure 3.
