The most classical approaches are the probabilistic IBM models 1-5 (Brown et al., 1993) and the HMM model (Vogel et al., 1996). Various studies have extended those models. Yang et al. (2013) adapted the Context-Dependent Deep Neural Network for HMM (CD-DNN-HMM) (Dahl et al., 2012), a type of feed-forward neural network (FFNN)-based model, to","∗","The first author is now affiliated with Knowledge Discovery Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation, Nara, Japan. the HMM alignment model and achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, the FFNN-based model assumes a first-order Markov dependence for alignments.","Recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance that outperformed FFNN-based models for various tasks (Mikolov et al., 2010; Mikolov and Zweig, 2012; Auli et al., 2013; Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sundermeyer et al., 2013). An RNN has a hidden layer with recurrent connections that propagates its own previous signals. Through the recurrent architecture, RNN-based models have the inherent property of modeling long-span dependencies, e.g., long contexts, in input data. We assume that this property would fit with a word alignment task, and we propose an RNN-based word alignment model. Our model can maintain and arbitrarily integrate an alignment history, e.g., bilingual context, which is longer than the FFNN-based model.","The NN-based alignment models are supervised models. Unfortunately, it is usually difficult to prepare word-by-word aligned bilingual data. Yang et al. (2013) trained their model from word alignments produced by traditional unsupervised probabilistic models. However, with this approach, errors induced by probabilistic models are learned as correct alignments; thus, generalization capabilities are limited. To solve this problem, we apply noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) (Gutmann and Hyvärinen, 2010; Mnih and Teh, 2012) for unsupervised training of our RNN-based model without gold standard alignments or pseudo-oracle alignments. NCE artificially generates bilingual sentences through samplings as pseudo-negative samples, and then trains the model such that the scores of the original bilingual sentences are higher than those of the sampled bilingual sentences.","Our RNN-based alignment model has a direc-1470 tion, such as other alignment models, i.e., from f (source language) to e (target language) and from e to f . It has been proven that the limitation may be overcome by encouraging two directional models to agree by training them concurrently (Matusov et al., 2004; Liang et al., 2006; Graca̧ et al., 2008; Ganchev et al., 2008). The motivation for this stems from the fact that model and generaliza-tion errors by the two models differ, and the models must complement each other. Based on this motivation, our directional models are also simultaneously trained. Specifically, our training encourages word embeddings to be consistent across alignment directions by introducing a penalty term that expresses the difference between embedding of words into an objective function. This constraint prevents each model from overfitting to a particular direction and leads to global optimiza-tion across alignment directions.","This paper presents evaluations of Japanese-English and French-English word alignment tasks and Japanese-to-English and Chinese-to-English translation tasks. The results illustrate that our RNN-based model outperforms the FFNN-based model (up to +0.0792 F1-measure) and the IBM Model 4 (up to +0.0703 F1-measure) for the word alignment tasks. For the translation tasks, our model achieves up to 0.74% gain in BLEU as compared to the FFNN-based model, which matches the translation qualities of the IBM Model 4."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Various word alignment models have been proposed. These models are roughly clustered into two groups: generative models, such as those proposed by Brown et al. (1993), Vogel et al. (1996), and Och and Ney (2003), and discriminative models, such as those proposed by Taskar et al. (2005), Moore (2005), and Blunsom and Cohn (2006). 2.1 Generative Alignment Model","Given a source language sentence f J 1 = f1, ..., fJ","and a target language sentence eI 1 = e1, ..., eI , f J 1 is generated by eI","1 via the alignment aJ","1 = a1, ..., aJ . Each aj is a hidden variable indicat-ing that the source word fj is aligned to the target word eaj . Usually, a “null” word e0 is added to the target language sentence and aJ","1 may contain aj = 0, which indicates that fj is not aligned to any target word. The probability of generating the","sentence f J 1 from eI","1 is defined as","p(f J 1 |eI","1) = ∑ aJ 1","p(f J","1 , aJ","1 |eI","1).

(2) The three models differ in their definition of alignment probability. For example, the HMM model uses an alignment probability with a first-order Markov property: pa(aj|aj − aj−1). In addition, the IBM models 3-5 are extensions of these, which consider the fertility and distortion of each translated word.","These models are trained using the expectationmaximization algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) from bilingual sentences without word-level alignments (unlabeled training data). Given a specific model, the best alignment (Viterbi alignment) of the sentence pair (f J","1 , eI","1) can be found as","âJ","1 = argmax","aJ","1","p(f J","1 , aJ","1 |eI","1). (3) For example, the HMM model identifies the Viterbi alignment using the Viterbi algorithm. 2.2 FFNN-based Alignment Model As an instance of discriminative models, we describe an FFNN-based word alignment model (Yang et al., 2013), which is our baseline. An FFNN learns a hierarchy of nonlinear features that can automatically capture complex statistical patterns in input data. Recently, FFNNs have been applied successfully to several tasks, such as speech recognition (Dahl et al., 2012), statistical machine translation (Le et al., 2012; Vaswani et al., 2013), and other popular natural language processing tasks (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Collobert et al., 2011).","Yang et al.

Note that the model uses nonprobabilistic scores rather than probabilities because normalization over all words is computationally expensive. The model finds the Viterbi alignment using the Viterbi algorithm, similar to the classic HMM model. Note that alignments in the FFNN-based model are also governed by first-order Markov dynamics because an alignment score depends on the previous alignment aj−1.","Figure 1 shows the network structure with one hidden layer for computing a lexical translation probability tlex(fj, eaj |c(fj), c(eaj )). The model consists of a lookup layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer, which have weight matrices. The model receives a source and target word with their contexts as inputs, which are words in a predefined window (the window size is three in Figure 1). First, the lookup layer converts each input word into its word embedding by looking up its corresponding column in the embedding matrix (L), and then concatenates them. Let Vf (or Ve) be a set of source words (or target words) and M be a predetermined embedding length. L is a M × (|Vf | + |Ve|) matrix1",". Word embeddings are dense, low dimensional, and real-valued vectors that can capture syntactic and semantic properties of the words (Bengio et al., 2003). The concatenation (z0) is then fed to the hidden layer to capture nonlinear relations. Finally, the output layer receives the output of the hidden layer (z1) and computes a lexical translation score. 1 We add a special token ⟨unk⟩ to handle unknown words","and ⟨null⟩ to handle null alignments to Vf and Ve The computations in the hidden and output layer","are as follows2",": z1 = f (H × z0 + BH ), (5) tlex = O × z1 + BO, (6) where H, BH , O, and BO are |z1| × |z0|, |z1| × 1, 1 × |z1|, and 1 × 1 matrices, respectively, and f (x) is an activation function.

When computing the score of the alignment between fj and eaj , the two words are input to the lookup layer. In the lookup layer, each of these words is converted to its word embedding, and then the concatenation of the two embeddings (xj) is fed to the hidden layer in the same manner as the FFNN-based model. Next, the hidden layer receives the output of the lookup layer (xj) and that of the previous hidden layer (yj−1). The hidden layer then computes and outputs the nonlinear relations between them. Note that the weight matrices used in this computation are embodied by the specific jump distance d. The output of the hidden layer (yj) is copied and fed to the output layer and the next hidden layer.

Therefore, the proposed model can find alignments by taking advantage of the long alignment history, while the FFNN-based model considers only the last alignment."]},{"title":"4 Training","paragraphs":["During training, we optimize the weight matrices of each layer (i.e., L, Hd",", Rd",", Bd","H , O, and BO) following a given objective using a mini-batch SGD with batch size D, which converges faster than a plain SGD (D = 1). Gradients are computed by the back-propagation through time algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986), which unfolds the network in time (j) and computes gradients over time steps. In addition, an l2 regularization term is added to the objective to prevent the model from overfitting the training data.","The RNN-based model can be trained by a supervised approach, similar to the FFNN-based model, where training proceeds based on the ranking loss defined by Eq. 7 (Section 2.2). However, this approach requires gold standard alignments. To overcome this drawback, we propose an unsupervised method using NCE, which learns from unlabeled training data. 4.1 Unsupervised Learning Dyer et al. (2011) presented an unsupervised alignment model based on contrastive estimation (CE) (Smith and Eisner, 2005). CE seeks to discriminate observed data from its neighborhood, 1473 which can be viewed as pseudo-negative samples. Dyer et al. (2011) regarded all possible alignments of the bilingual sentences, which are given as training data (T ), and those of the full translation search space (Ω) as the observed data and its neighborhood, respectively.","We introduce this idea to a ranking loss with margin as loss(θ) = max { 0, 1 − ∑","(f+ ;e+",")∈T","EΦ[sθ(a|f + , e+",")] + ∑","(f+ ,e",")∈Ω","EΦ[sθ(a|f +",", e",")]}",", (11) where Φ is a set of all possible alignments given (f , e), EΦ[sθ] is the expected value of the scores sθ on Φ, e+","denotes a target language sentence in the training data, and e","denotes a pseudo-target language sentence. The first expectation term is for the observed data, and the second is for the neighborhood.","However, the computation for Ω is prohibitively expensive. To reduce computation, we employ NCE, which uses randomly sampled sentences from all target language sentences in Ω as e",", and calculate the expected values by a beam search with beam width W to truncate alignments with low scores. In our experiments, we set W to 100. In addition, the above criterion is converted to an online fashion as loss(θ) = ∑","f+ ∈T","max{","0, 1 − EGEN[sθ(a|f +",", e+",")] + 1 N ∑ e","EGEN[sθ(a|f + , e",")] } , (12) where e+","is a target language sentence aligned to f +","in the training data, i.e., (f +",", e+",") ∈ T , e","is a randomly sampled pseudo-target language sentence with length |e+","|, and N denotes the number of pseudo-target language sentences per source sentence f +",". Note that |e+","| = |e","|. GEN is a subset of all possible word alignments Φ, which is generated by beam search. In a simple implementation, each e","is generated by repeating a random sampling from a set of target words (Ve) |e+","| times and lining them up sequentially. To employ more discriminative negative samples, our implementation samples each word of e","from a set of the target words that cooccur with fi ∈ f +","whose probability is above a threshold C under the IBM Model 1 incorporating l0 prior (Vaswani et al., 2012). The IBM Model 1 with l0 prior is convenient for reducing translation candidates because it generates more sparse alignments than the standard IBM Model 1. 4.2 Agreement Constraints Both of the FFNN-based and RNN-based models are based on the HMM alignment model, and they are therefore asymmetric, i.e., they can represent one-to-many relations from the target side. Asymmetric models are usually trained in each alignment direction. The model proposed by Yang et al. (2013) is no exception. However, it has been demonstrated that encouraging directional models to agree improves alignment performance (Matusov et al., 2004; Liang et al., 2006; Graca̧ et al., 2008; Ganchev et al., 2008).","Inspired by their work, we introduce an agreement constraint to our learning. The constraint concretely enforces agreement in word embeddings of both directions. The proposed method trains two directional models concurrently based on the following objective by incorporating a penalty term that expresses the difference between word embeddings:","argmin θFE { loss(θF E) + α∥θLEF − θLFE ∥ } , (13)","argmin θEF { loss(θEF ) + α∥θLFE − θLEF ∥}",", (14) where θF E (or θEF ) denotes the weights of layers in a source-to-target (or target-to-source) alignment model, θL denotes weights of a lookup layer, i.e., word embeddings, and α is a parameter that controls the strength of the agreement constraint. ∥θ∥ indicates the norm of θ. 2-norm is used in our experiments. Equations 13 and 14 can be applied to both supervised and unsupervised approaches. Equations 7 and 12 are substituted into loss(θ) in supervised and unsupervised learning, respectively. The proposed constraint penalizes overfitting to a particular direction and enables two directional models to optimize across alignment directions globally.","Our unsupervised learning procedure is summarized in Algorithm 1.

The other parameters were set as follows: W , N and C in the unsupervised learning were 100, 50, and 0.001, respectively, and α for the agreement constraint was 0.1.","In the translation tasks, we used the Moses phrase-based SMT systems (Koehn et al., 2007).

These results demonstrate that captur-ing the long alignment history in the RNN-based model improves the alignment performance. We discuss the difference of the RNN-based model’s effectiveness between language pairs in Section 6.1. Table 2 also shows that RN Ns+c(R/I) and RN Nu+c achieve significantly better performance than RN Ns(R/I) and RN Nu in both tasks, respectively. This indicates that the proposed agreement constraint is effective in training better models in both the supervised and unsupervised approaches.","In BT EC, RN Nu and RN Nu+c significantly outperform RN Ns(I) and RN Ns+c(I), respectively.

Furthermore, we proposed an unsupervised method for training our model using NCE and introduced an agreement constraint that encourages word embeddings to be consistent across alignment directions. Our experiments have shown that the proposed model outperforms the FFNN-based model (Yang et al., 2013) for word alignment and machine translation, and that the agreement constraint improves alignment performance.","In future, we plan to employ contexts composed of surrounding words (e.g., c(fj) or c(eaj ) in the FFNN-based model) in our model, even though our model implicitly encodes such contexts in the alignment history. We also plan to enrich each hidden layer in our model with multiple layers following the success of Yang et al. (2013), in which multiple hidden layers improved the performance of the FFNN-based model. In addition, we would like to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method for other datasets."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful suggestions and valuable comments on the first version of this paper."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Michael Auli, Michel Galley, Chris Quirk, and Geoffrey Zweig. 2013.
