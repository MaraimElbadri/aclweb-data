We translate questions to answers based on CYK parsing. Answers as translations of the span covered by each CYK cell are obtained by a question translation method, which first generates formal triple queries as MRs for the span based on question patterns and relation expressions, and then retrieves answers from a given KB based on triple queries generated.

Most previous systems tackle this task in a cascaded manner: First, the input question is transformed into its meaning representation (MR) by an independent semantic parser (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Mooney, 2007; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2011; Liang et al., 2011; Cai and Yates,","∗","This work was finished while the author was visiting Microsoft Research Asia. 2013; Poon, 2013; Artzi et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013; Berant et al., 2013); Then, the answers are retrieved from existing KBs using generated MRs as queries.","Unlike existing KB-QA systems which treat semantic parsing and answer retrieval as two cascaded tasks, this paper presents a unified framework that can integrate semantic parsing into the question answering procedure directly. Borrow-ing ideas from machine translation (MT), we treat the QA task as a translation procedure. Like MT, CYK parsing is used to parse each input question, and answers of the span covered by each CYK cell are considered the translations of that cell; unlike MT, which uses offline-generated translation tables to translate source phrases into target translations, a semantic parsing-based question translation method is used to translate each span into its answers on-the-fly, based on question patterns and relation expressions. The final answers can be obtained from the root cell. Derivations generated during such a translation procedure are modeled by a linear model, and minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) is used to tune feature weights based on a set of question-answer pairs.","Figure 1 shows an example: the question director of movie starred by Tom Hanks is translated to one of its answers Robert Zemeckis by three main steps: (i) translate director of to director of ; (ii) translate movie starred by Tom Hanks to one of its answers Forrest Gump; (iii) translate director of Forrest Gump to a final answer Robert Zemeckis. Note that the updated question covered by Cell[0, 6] is obtained by combining the answers to question spans covered by Cell[0, 1] and Cell[2, 6].","The contributions of this work are two-fold: (1) We propose a translation-based KB-QA method that integrates semantic parsing and QA in one unified framework. The benefit of our method is that we don’t need to explicitly generate complete semantic structures for input questions.

We define the task of transforming question spans into formal triples as question translation. A denotes one final answer of Q.","• hi(·) denotes the ith feature function. • λi denotes the feature weight of hi(·).","According to the above description, our KB-QA method can be decomposed into four tasks as: (1) search space generation for H(Q); (2) question translation for transforming question spans into their corresponding formal triples; (3) feature design for hi(·); and (4) feature weight tuning for {λi}. We present details of these four tasks in the following subsections one-by-one. 2.2 Search Space Generation We first present our translation-based KB-QA method in Algorithm 1, which is used to generate H(Q) for each input NL question Q. Algorithm 1: Translation-based KB-QA 1 for l = 1 to |Q| do 2 for all i, j s.t. j − i = l do 3 H(Qj","i ) = ∅; 4 T = QT rans(Qj","i , KB); 5 foreach formal triple t ∈ T do 6 create a new derivation d; 7 d.A = t.eobj; 8 d.D = {t}; 9 update the model score of d; 10 insert d to H(Qj","i ); 11 end 12 end 13 end 14 for l = 1 to |Q| do 15 for all i, j s.t. j − i = l do 16 for all m s.t. i ≤ m < j do 17 for dl ∈ H(Qm","i ) and dr ∈ H(Qj","m+1) do 18 Qupdate = dl.A + dr.A; 19 T = QT rans(Qupdate, KB); 20 foreach formal triple t ∈ T do 21 create a new derivation d; 22 d.A = t.eobj; 23 d.D = dl.D ⋃ dr.D","⋃","{t};","24 update the model score of d;","25 insert d to H(Qj i ); 26 end 27 end 28 end 29 end 30 end 31 return H(Q). 968 The first half (from Line 1 to Line 13) generates a formal triple set T for each unary span Qj i ∈ Q, using the question translation method QT rans(Qj","i , KB) (Line 4), which takes Q","j","i as the","input. Each triple t ∈ T returned is in the form of","{esbj, p, eobj}, where esbj’s mention occurs in Qj","i ,","p is a predicate that denotes the meaning expressed","by the context of esbj in Qj","i , eobj is an answer of Qj","i based on esbj, p and KB. We describe the implementation detail of QT rans(·) in Section 2.3.","The second half (from Line 14 to Line 31) first updates the content of each bigger span Qj","i by concatenating the answers to its any two consecutive smaller spans covered by Q j i (Line 18). Then, QT rans(Qj","i , KB) is called to generate triples for the updated span (Line 19). The above operations are equivalent to answering a simplified question, which is obtained by replacing the answerable spans in the original question with their corresponding answers. The search space H(Q) for the entire question Q is returned at last (Line 31). 2.3 Question Translation The purpose of question translation is to translate a span Q to a set of formal triples T . Each triple t ∈ T is in the form of {esbj, p, eobj}, where esbj’s mention3","occurs in Q, p is a predicate that denotes the meaning expressed by the context of esbj in Q, eobj is an answer to Q retrieved from KB using a triple query q = {esbj, p, ?}. Note that if no predicate p or answer eobj can be generated, {Q, N ull, Q} will be returned as a special triple, which sets eobj to be Q itself, and p to be N ull. This makes sure the un-answerable spans can be passed on to the higher-level operations.","Question translation assumes each span Q is a single-relation question (Fader et al., 2013). Such assumption simplifies the efforts of semantic parsing to the minimum question units, while leaving the capability of handling multiple-relation questions (Figure 1 gives one such example) to the outer CYK-parsing based translation procedure. Two question translation methods are presented in the rest of this subsection, which are based on question patterns and relation expressions respectively. 2.3.1 Question Pattern-based Translation A question pattern QP includes a pattern string QPpattern, which is composed of words and a slot 3 For simplicity, a cleaned entity dictionary dumped from","the entire KB is used to detect entity mentions in Q. Algorithm 2: QP-based Question Translation 1 T = ∅; 2 foreach entity mention eQ ∈ Q do 3 Qpattern = replace eQ in Q with [Slot]; 4 foreach question pattern QP do 5 if Qpattern == QPpattern then 6 E = Disambiguate(eQ, QPpredicate); 7 foreach e ∈ E do 8 create a new triple query q; 9 q = {e, QPpredicate, ?}; 10 {Ai} = AnswerRetrieve(q, KB); 11 foreach A ∈ {Ai} do 12 create a new formal triple t; 13 t = {q.esbj, q.p, A}; 14 t.score = 1.0; 15 insert t to T ; 16 end 17 end 18 end 19 end 20 end 21 return T . symbol [Slot], and a KB predicate QPpredicate, which denotes the meaning expressed by the context words in QPpattern.","Algorithm 2 shows how to generate formal triples for a span Q based on question patterns (QP-based question translation). For each entity mention eQ ∈ Q, we replace it with [Slot] and obtain a pattern string Qpattern (Line 3). If Qpattern can match one QPpattern, then we construct a triple query q (Line 9) using QPpredicate as its predicate and one of the KB entities returned by Disambiguate(eQ, QPpredicate) as its subject entity (Line 6). Here, the objective of Disambiguate(eQ, QPpredicate) is to output a set of disambiguated KB entities E in KB. The name of each entity returned equals the input entity mention eQ and occurs in some assertions where QPpredicate are the predicates. The underlying idea is to use the context (predicate) information to help entity disambiguation. The answers of q are returned by AnswerRetrieve(q, KB) based on q and KB (Line 10), each of which is used to construct a formal triple and added to T for Q (from Line 11 to Line 16). Figure 2 gives an example.","Question patterns are collected as follows: First, 5W queries, which begin with What, Where, Who, When, or Which, are selected from a large scale query log of a commercial search engine; Then, a cleaned entity dictionary is used to annotate each query by replacing all entity mentions it contains with the symbol [Slot]. Only high-frequent query patterns which contain one [Slot] are maintained; 969 Q : who is the director of Forrest Gump QPpattern : who is the director of [Slot] QPpredicate : Film.Film.Director q : <Forrest Gump, Film.Film.Director, ?> t : <Forrest Gump, Film.Film.Director, Robert Zemeckis> KB Figure 2: QP-based question translation example Lastly, annotators try to manually label the mostfrequent 50,000 query patterns with their corresponding predicates, and 4,764 question patterns with single labeled predicates are obtained.","From experiments (Table 3 in Section 4.3) we can see that, question pattern based question translation can achieve high end-to-end accuracy. But as human efforts are needed in the mining procedure, this method cannot be extended to large scale very easily. Besides, different users often type the questions with the same meaning in different NL expressions. For example, although the question Forrest Gump was directed by which moviemaker means the same as the question Q in Figure 2, no question pattern can cover it. We need to find an alternative way to alleviate such coverage issue. 2.3.2 Relation Expression-based Translation Aiming to alleviate the coverage issue occurring in QP-based method, an alternative relation expression (RE) -based method is proposed, and will be used when the QP-based method fails.","We define REp as a relation expression set for a given KB predicate p ∈ KB. Each relation expression RE ∈ REp includes an expression string REexpression, which must contain at least one content word, and a weight REweight, which denotes the confidence that REexpression can represent p’s meaning in NL. For example, is the director of is one relation expression string for the predicate Film.Film.Director, which means it is usually used to express this relation (predicate) in NL.","Algorithm 3 shows how to generate triples for a question Q based on relation expressions. For each possible entity mention eQ ∈ Q and a KB predicate p ∈ KB that is related to a KB entity e whose name equals eQ, Sim(eQ, Q, REp) is computed (Line 5) based on the similarity between question context and REp, which measures how likely Q can be transformed into a triple query Algorithm 3: RE-based Question Translation 1 T = ∅; 2 foreach entity mention eQ ∈ Q do 3 foreach e ∈ KB s.t. e.name==eQ do 4 foreach predicate p ∈ KB related to e do 5 score = Sim(eQ, Q, REp); 6 if score > 0 then 7 create a new triple query q; 8 q = {e, p, ?}; 9 {Ai} = AnswerRetrieve(q, KB); 10 foreach A ∈ {Ai} do 11 create a new formal triple t; 12 t = {q.esbj, q.p, A}; 13 t.score = score; 14 insert t to T ; 15 end 16 end 17 end 18 end 19 end 20 sort T based on the score of each t ∈ T ; 21 return T . q = {e, p, ?}. If this score is larger than 0, which means there are overlaps between Q’s context and REp, then q will be used as the triple query of Q, and a set of formal triples will be generated based on q and KB (from Line 7 to Line 15). The computation of Sim(eQ, Q, REp) is defined as follows: ∑ n","1 |Q| − n + 1 · { ∑ ωn∈Q,ωn ⋂ eQ=φ P (ωn|REp)} where n is the n-gram order which ranges from 1 to 5, ωn is an n-gram occurring in Q without over-lapping with eQ and containing at least one content word, P (ωn|REp) is the posterior probability which is computed by: P (ωn|REp) = Count(ωn, REp)","∑ ω′ n∈REp Count(ω ′ n, REp) Count(ω, REp) denotes the weighted sum of times that ω occurs in REp: Count(ω, REp) = ∑ RE∈REp {#ω(RE) · REweight} where #ω(RE) denotes the number of times that ω occurs in REexpression, and REweight is decided by the relation expression extraction component.","Figure 3 gives an example, where n-grams with rectangles are the ones that occur in both Q’s context and the relation expression set of a given predicate p = F ilm.F ilm.Director. Unlike the QP-based method which needs a perfect match, the 970 Q : Forrest Gump was directed by which moviemaker","REFilm.Film.Director : is directed by was directed and written by is the moviemaker of was famous as the director of ... q : <Forrest Gump, Film.Film.Director, ?> t : <Forrest Gump, Film.Film.Director, Robert Zemeckis> KB Figure 3: RE-based question translation example RE-based method allows fuzzy matching between Q and REp, and records this (Line 13) in generated triples, which is used as features later.","Relation expressions are mined as follows: Given a set of KB assertions with an identical predicate p, we first extract all sentences from English Wiki pages4",", each of which contains at least one pair of entities occurring in one assertion. Then, we extract the shortest path between paired entities in the dependency tree of each sentence as an RE candidate for the given predicate. The intuition is that any sentence containing such entity pairs occur in an assertion is likely to express the predicate of that assertion in some way. Last, all relation expressions extracted are filtered by heuristic rules, i.e., the frequency must be larger than 4, the length must be shorter than 10, and then weighted by the pattern scoring methods proposed in (Gerber and Ngomo, 2011; Gerber and Ngomo, 2012). For each predicate, we only keep the relation expressions whose pattern scores are larger than a pre-defined threshold. Figure 4 gives one relation expression extraction example. The statistics and overall quality of the relation expressions are listed in Section 4.1. {Forrest Gump, Robert Zemeckis} {Titanic, James Cameron} {The Dark Knight Rises, Christopher Nolan} Paired entity of a KB predicate p=Film.Film.Director Passage retrieval from Wiki pages","Relation expression weighting Robert Zemeckis is the director of Forrest Gump James Cameron is the moviemaker of Titanic The Dark Knight Rises is directed by Christopher Nolan is the director of ||| 0.25 is the moviemaker of ||| 0.23 is directed by ||| 0.20 Figure 4: RE extraction example 4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database download 2.3.3 Question Decomposition Sometimes, a question may provide multiple constraints to its answers. movie starred by Tom Hanks in 1994 is one such question. All the films as the answers of this question should satisfy the following two constraints: (1) starred by Tom Hanks; and (2) released in 1994. It is easy to see that such questions cannot be translated to single triples.","We propose a dependency tree-based method to handle such multiple-constraint questions by (i) decomposing the original question into a set of sub-questions using syntax-based patterns; and (ii) intersecting the answers of all sub-questions as the final answers of the original question. Note, question decomposition only operates on the original question and question spans covered by complete dependency subtrees. Four syntax-based patterns (Figure 5) are used for question decomposition. If a question matches any one of these patterns, then sub-questions are generated by collecting the path-s between n0 and each ni(i > 0) in the pattern, where each n denotes a complete subtree with a noun, number, or question word as its root node, the symbol ∗ above prep∗","denotes this preposition can be skipped in matching. For the question mentioned at the beginning, its two sub-questions generated are movie starred by Tom Hanks and movie starred in 1994, as its dependency form matches pattern (a).

The more constraints an answer satisfies, the better. Obviously, current patterns used can’t cover all cases but most-common ones. We leave a more general pattern mining method for future work. 2.4 Feature Design The objective of our KB-QA system is to seek the derivation ⟨ D̂, Â⟩ that maximizes the probability P (⟨D, A⟩|KB, Q) described in Section 2.1 as:","⟨ D̂, Â⟩ = argmax ⟨D,A⟩∈H(Q) P (⟨D, A⟩|KB, Q)","= argmax ⟨D,A⟩∈H(Q) M ∑ i=1 λi · hi(⟨D, A⟩, KB, Q) We now introduce the feature sets {hi(·)} that are used in the above linear model:","• hquestion word(·), which counts the number of original question words occurring in A. It penalizes those partially answered questions.","• hspan(·), which counts the number of spans in Q that are converted to formal triples. It controls the granularity of the spans used in question translation.","• hsyntax subtree(·), which counts the number of spans in Q that are (1) converted to formal triples, whose predicates are not N ull, and (2) covered by complete dependency subtrees at the same time. The underlying intuition is that, dependency subtrees of Q should be treated as units for question translation.","• hsyntax constraint(·), which counts the number of triples in D that are converted from sub-questions generated by the question decomposition component.","• htriple(·), which counts the number of triples in D, whose predicates are not N ull.","• htripleweight(·), which sums the scores of all triples {ti} in D as","∑ ti∈D ti.score.","• hQPcount(·), which counts the number of triples in D that are generated by QP-based question translation method.","• hREcount(·), which counts the number of triples in D that are generated by RE-based question translation method.","• hstaticranksbj (·), which sums the static rank scores of all subject entities in D’s triple set as","∑ ti∈D ti.esbj.static rank.","• hstaticrankobj (·), which sums the static rank scores of all object entities in D’s triple set as∑","ti∈D ti.eobj.static rank.","• hconfidenceobj (·), which sums the confidence scores of all object entities in D’s triple set as∑","t∈D t.eobj.conf idence.

These three scores are used as features to rank answers generated in QA procedure. 2.5 Feature Weight Tuning Given a set of question-answer pairs {Qi, A","ref","i } as the development (dev) set, we use the minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) algorithm to tune the feature weights λM","i in our proposed model. The training criterion is to seek the feature weights that can minimize the accumulated errors of the top-1 answer of questions in the dev set:","λ̂M","1 = argmin","λM","1 N ∑ i=1","Err(Aref i , Âi; λM","1 ) N is the number of questions in the dev set, Aref","i is the correct answers as references of the ith","question in the dev set, Âi is the top-1 answer candidate of the ith","question in the dev set based on feature weights λM","1 , Err(·) is the error function which is defined as: Err(A ref i , Âi; λM","1 ) = 1 − δ(A ref i , Âi) where δ(Aref","i , Âi) is an indicator function which equals 1 when Âi is included in the reference set Aref","i , and 0 otherwise."]},{"title":"3 Comparison with Previous Work","paragraphs":["Our work intersects with two research directions: semantic parsing and question answering.","Some previous works on semantic parsing (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Wong and Mooney, 2006; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007; Wong and Mooney,","5","The static rank score of an entity represents a general indicator of the overall quality of that entity. 972 2007; Kwiatkowski et al., 2010; Kwiatkowski et al., 2011) require manually annotated logical forms as supervision, and are hard to extend result-ing parsers from limited domains, such as GEO, JOBS and ATIS, to open domains. Recent works (Clarke and Lapata, 2010; Liang et al., 2013) have alleviated such issues using question-answer pairs as weak supervision, but still with the shortcoming of using limited lexical triggers to link NL phrases to predicates. Poon (2013) has proposed an unsupervised method by adopting grounded-learning to leverage the database for indirect supervision. But transformation from NL questions to MRs heavily depends on dependency parsing results. Besides, the KB used (ATIS) is limited as well. Kwiatkowski et al. (2013) use Wiktionary and a limited manual lexicon to map POS tags to a set of predefined CCG lexical categories, which aims to reduce the need for learning lexicon from training data. But it still needs human efforts to define lexical categories, which usually can not cover all the semantic phenomena.","Berant et al. (2013) have not only enlarged the KB used for Freebase (Google, 2013), but also used a bigger lexicon trigger set extracted by the open IE method (Lin et al., 2012) for NL phrases to predicates linking. In comparison, our method has further advantages: (1) Question answering and semantic parsing are performed in an join-t way under a unified framework; (2) A robust method is proposed to map NL questions to their formal triple queries, which trades off the mapping quality by using question patterns and relation expressions in a cascaded way; and (3) We use domain independent feature set which allowing us to use a relatively small number of question-answer pairs to tune model parameters.","Fader et al. (2013) map questions to formal (triple) queries over a large scale, open-domain database of facts extracted from a raw corpus by ReVerb (Fader et al., 2011). Compared to their work, our method gains an improvement in two aspects: (1) Instead of using facts extracted using the open IE method, we leverage a large scale, high-quality knowledge base; (2) We can handle multiple-relation questions, instead of single-relation queries only, based on our translation based KB-QA framework.","Espana-Bonet and Comas (2012) have proposed an MT-based method for factoid QA. But MT in there work means to translate questions into n-best translations, which are used for finding similar sentences in the document collection that probably contain answers. Echihabi and Marcu (2003) have developed a noisy-channel model for QA, which explains how a sentence containing an answer to a given question can be rewritten into that question through a sequence of stochastic operations. Compared to the above two MT-motivated QA work, our method uses MT methodology to translate questions to answers directly."]},{"title":"4 Experiment 4.1 Data Sets","paragraphs":["Following Berant et al.

For evaluation, we follow Berant et al.

Since Freebase is completely contained by our KB, we disallow all entities which are not included by Freebase. By doing so, our KB provides the same knowledge as Freebase does, which means we do not gain any extra advantage by using a larger KB. But we still allow ourselves to use the static rank scores and confidence scores of entities as features, as we described in Section 2.4. 4.3 Evaluation Results We first show the overall evaluation results of our KB-QA system and compare them with baseline’s results on Dev and Test.

Accuracy is defined as the number of correctly answered questions divided by the total number of questions.","Table 3 shows our KB-QA method outperforms baseline on both Dev and Test. We think the potential reasons of this improvement include:","• Different methods are used to map NL phrases to KB predicates. Berant et al. (2013) have used a lexicon extracted from a subset of ReVerb triples (Lin et al., 2012), which is similar to the relation expression set used in question translation. But as our relation expressions are extracted by an in-house extractor, we can record their extraction-related statistics as extra information, and use them as features to measure the mapping quality. Besides, as a portion of entities in our KB are extracted from Wiki, we know the one-to-one correspondence between such entities and Wiki pages, and use this information in relation expression extraction for entity disambiguation. A lower disambiguation error rate results in better relation expressions.","• Question patterns are used to map NL context to KB predicates. Context can be either continuous or discontinues phrases. Although the size of this set is limited, they can actually cover head questions/queries6","very well. The underlying intuition of using patterns is that those high-frequent questions/queries should and can be treated and solved in the QA task, by involving human effort at a relative small price but with very impressive accuracy.","In order to figure out the impacts of question patterns and relation expressions, another experiment (Table 4) is designed to evaluate their independent influences, where QPonly and REonly denote the results of KB-QA systems which only allow question patterns and relation expressions in question translation respectively. Settings Test (Accuracy) Test (Precision) QPonly 11.8% 97.5% REonly 32.5% 73.2% Table 4: Impacts of question patterns and relation expressions.

We think this improvement comes from two aspects: (1) The quality of the relation expressions is better than the quality of the lexicon entries used in the baseline; and (2) We use the extraction-related statistics of relation expressions as features, which brings more information to measure the confidence of mapping between NL phrases and KB predicates, and makes the model to be more flexible. Meanwhile, QPonly perform worse (11.8%) than REonly, due to coverage issue. But by comparing the precision-s of these two settings, we find QPonly (97.5%) outperforms REonly (73.2%) significantly, due to its high quality. This means how to extract high-quality question patterns is worth to be studied for the question answering task.","As the performance of our KB-QA system relies heavily on the k-best beam approximation, we evaluate the impact of the beam size and list the comparison results in Figure 6. We can see that as","6","Head questions/queries mean the questions/queries with high frequency and clear patterns. 974 we increase k incrementally, the accuracy increase at the same time. However, a larger k (e.g. 200) cannot bring significant improvements comparing to a smaller one (e.g., 20), but using a large k has a tremendous impact on system efficiency. So we choose k = 20 as the optimal value in above experiments, which trades off between accuracy and efficiency. 00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.40.45 5 20 50 100 200 Accuracy on Test Accuracy Figure 6: Impacts of beam size on accuracy.","Actually, the size of our system’s search space is much smaller than the one of the semantic parser used in the baseline.This is due to the fact that, if triple queries generated by the question translation component cannot derive any answer from KB, we will discard such triple queries directly during the QA procedure. We can see that using a small k can achieve better results than baseline, where the beam size is set to be 200. 4.4 Error Analysis 4.4.1 Entity Detection Since named entity recognizers trained on Penn TreeBank usually perform poorly on web queries, We instead use a simple string-match method to detect entity mentions in the question using a cleaned entity dictionary dumped from our KB. One problem of doing so is the entity detection issue. For example, in the question who was Esther’s husband ?, we cannot detect Esther as an entity, as it is just part of an entity name. We need an ad-hoc entity detection component to handle such issues, especially for a web scenario, where users often type entity names in their partial or abbreviation forms. 4.4.2 Predicate Mapping Some questions lack sufficient evidences to detect predicates. where is Byron Nelson 2012 ? is an example. Since each relation expression must contain at least one content word, this question cannot match any relation expression. Except for Byron Nelson and 2012, all the others are non-content words.","Besides, ambiguous entries contained in relation expression sets of different predicates can bring mapping errors as well. For the following question who did Steve Spurrier play pro football for? as an example, since the unigram play exists in both Film.Film.Actor and Ameri-can Football.Player.Current Team ’s relation expression sets, we made a wrong prediction, which led to wrong answers. 4.4.3 Specific Questions Sometimes, we cannot give exact answers to superlative questions like what is the first book Sherlock Holmes appeared in?. For this example, we can give all book names where Sherlock Holmes appeared in, but we cannot rank them based on their publication date , as we cannot learn the alignment between the constraint word first occurred in the question and the predicate Book.Written Work.Date Of First Publication from training data automatically. Although we have followed some work (Poon, 2013; Liang et al., 2013) to handle such special linguistic phenomena by defining some specific operators, it is still hard to cover all unseen cases. We leave this to future work as an independent topic."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["This paper presents a translation-based KB-QA method that integrates semantic parsing and QA in one unified framework. Comparing to the baseline system using an independent semantic parser with state-of-the-art performance, we achieve better results on a general domain evaluation set.","Several directions can be further explored in the future: (i) We plan to design a method that can extract question patterns automatically, using existing labeled question patterns and KB as weak supervision. As we discussed in the experiment part, how to mine high-quality question patterns is worth further study for the QA task; (ii) We plan to integrate an ad-hoc NER into our KB-QA system to alleviate the entity detection issue; (iii) In fact, our proposed QA framework can be general-ized to other intelligence besides knowledge bases as well. Any method that can generate answers to questions, such as the Web-based QA approach, can be integrated into this framework, by using them in the question translation component. 975"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Yoav Artzi and Luke S.
