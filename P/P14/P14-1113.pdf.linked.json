They are the main components of ontologies or semantic thesauri (Miller, 1995; Suchanek et al., 2008). In the WordNet hierarchy, senses are organized according to the “is-a” relations. For example, “ dog” and “ canine” are connected by a directed edge. Here, “ canine” is called a hypernym of “ dog.” Conversely, “ dog” is a hyponym of “ canine.” As key sources of knowledge, semantic thesauri and ontologies can support many natural language processing applications. However, these semantic resources are limited in its scope and domain, and their manual construction is knowledge intensive and time consuming. Therefore, many researchers","∗","Email correspondence. 生物 organism 植物 plant","毛茛科 Ranunculaceae 乌头属 Aconitum","乌头","aconite","植物药","medicinal plant 药品 medicine 生物 organism 植物 plant","毛茛科 Ranunculaceae 乌头属 Aconitum 乌头 aconite","植物药 medicinal plant 药品 medicine Figure 1: An example of semantic hierarchy construction. have attempted to automatically extract semantic relations or to construct taxonomies.","A major challenge for this task is the automatic discovery of hypernym-hyponym relations. Fu et al. (2013) propose a distant supervision method to extract hypernyms for entities from multiple sources. The output of their model is a list of hypernyms for a given enity (left panel, Figure 1). However, there usually also exists hypernym–hyponym relations among these hypernyms. For instance, “ 植 物 (plant)” and “ 毛 茛 科 (Ranunculaceae)” are both hypernyms of the entity “ 乌 头 (aconit),” and “ 植 物 (plant)” is also a hypernym of “ 毛 茛 科 (Ranunculaceae).” Given a list of hypernyms of an entity, our goal in the present work is to construct a semantic hierarchy of these hypernyms (right panel, Figure 1).1","Some previous works extend and refine manually-built semantic hierarchies by using other resources (e.g., Wikipedia) (Suchanek et al., 2008). However, the coverage is limited by the scope of the resources. Several other works relied heavily on lexical patterns, which would suffer from deficiency because such patterns can only cover a small proportion of complex linguistic circumstances (Hearst, 1992; Snow et al., 2005).","1","In this study, we focus on Chinese semantic hierarchy construction. The proposed method can be easily adapted to other languages. 1199 Besides, distributional similarity methods (Kotlerman et al., 2010; Lenci and Benotto, 2012) are based on the assumption that a term can only be used in contexts where its hypernyms can be used and that a term might be used in any contexts where its hyponyms are used. However, it is not always rational. Our previous method based on web mining (Fu et al., 2013) works well for hypernym extraction of entity names, but it is unsuitable for semantic hierarchy construction which in-volves many words with broad semantics. More-over, all of these methods do not use the word semantics effectively.","This paper proposes a novel approach for semantic hierarchy construction based on word embeddings. Word embeddings, also known as distributed word representations, typically represent words with dense, low-dimensional and realvalued vectors. Word embeddings have been empirically shown to preserve linguistic regularities, such as the semantic relationship between words (Mikolov et al., 2013b). For example, v(king) − v(queen) ≈ v(man) − v(woman), where v(w) is the embedding of the word w. We observe that a similar property also applies to the hypernym–hyponym relationship (Section 3.3), which is the main inspiration of the present study.","However, we further observe that hypernym– hyponym relations are more complicated than a single offset can represent. To address this challenge, we propose a more sophisticated and general method — learning a linear projection which maps words to their hypernyms (Section 3.3.1). Furthermore, we propose a piecewise linear projection method based on relation clustering to better model hypernym–hyponym relations (Section 3.3.2). Subsequently, we identify whether an unknown word pair is a hypernym–hyponym relation using the projections (Section 3.4). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply word embeddings to this task.","For evaluation, we manually annotate a dataset containing 418 Chinese entities and their hypernym hierarchies, which is the first dataset for this task as far as we know. The experimental results show that our method achieves an F-score of 73.74% which significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, combining our method with the manually-built hierarchy extension method proposed by Suchanek et al. (2008) can further improve F-score to 80.29%."]},{"title":"2 Background","paragraphs":["As main components of ontologies, semantic hierarchies have been studied by many researchers. Some have established concept hierarchies based on manually-built semantic resources such as WordNet (Miller, 1995). Such hierarchies have good structures and high accuracy, but their coverage is limited to fine-grained concepts (e.g., “ Ranunculaceae” is not included in WordNet.). We have made similar obsevation that about a half of hypernym–hyponym relations are absent in a Chinese semantic thesaurus. Therefore, a broader range of resources is needed to supplement the manually built resources. In the construction of the famous ontology YAGO, Suchanek et al. (2008) link the categories in Wikipedia onto WordNet. However, the coverage is still limited by the scope of Wikipedia.","Several other methods are based on lexical patterns. They use manually or automatically constructed lexical patterns to mine hypernym– hyponym relations from text corpora. A hierarchy can then be built based on these pairwise relations. The pioneer work by Hearst (1992) has found out that linking two noun phrases (NPs) via certain lexical constructions often implies hypernym relations. For example, NP1 is a hypernym of NP2 in the lexical pattern “such NP 1 as NP2.” Snow et al. (2005) propose to automatically extract large numbers of lexico-syntactic patterns and subsequently detect hypernym relations from a large newswire corpus. Their method relies on accurate syntactic parsers, and the quality of the automatically extracted patterns is difficult to guarantee. Generally speaking, these pattern-based methods often suffer from low recall or precision because of the coverage or the quality of the patterns.","The distributional methods assume that the contexts of hypernyms are broader than the ones of their hyponyms. For distributional similarity computing, each word is represented as a semantic vector composed of the pointwise mutual information (PMI) with its contexts. Kotlerman et al. (2010) design a directional distributional measure to infer hypernym–hyponym relations based on the standard IR Average Precision evaluation measure. Lenci and Benotto (2012) propose another measure focusing on the contexts that hypernyms do not share with their hyponyms. However, broader semantics may not always infer broader contexts. For example, for terms “ Obama’ and 1200 “ American people”, it is hard to say whose contexts are broader.","Our previous work (Fu et al., 2013) applies a web mining method to discover the hypernyms of Chinese entities from multiple sources. We assume that the hypernyms of an entity co-occur with it frequently. It works well for named entities. But for class names (e.g., singers in Hong Kong, tropical fruits) with wider range of meanings, this assumption may fail.","In this paper, we aim to identify hypernym– hyponym relations using word embeddings, which have been shown to preserve good properties for capturing semantic relationship between words."]},{"title":"3 Method","paragraphs":["In this section, we first define the task formally. Then we elaborate on our proposed method composed of three major steps, namely, word embedding training, projection learning, and hypernym– hyponym relation identification. 3.1 Task Definition Given a list of hypernyms of an entity, our goal is to construct a semantic hierarchy on it (Figure 1). We represent the hierarchy as a directed graph G, in which the nodes denote the words, and the edges denote the hypernym–hyponym relations. Hypernym-hyponym relations are asymmetric and transitive when words are unambiguous: • ∀x, y ∈ L : x H −→y ⇒ ¬(y H −→x) • ∀x, y, z ∈ L : (x H −→z ∧ z H −→y) ⇒ x H −→y Here, L denotes the list of hypernyms. x, y and z denote the hypernyms in L. We use","H","−→ to represent a hypernym–hyponym relation in this paper. Actually, x, y and z are unambiguous as the hypernyms of a certain entity. Therefore, G should be a directed acyclic graph (DAG). 3.2 Word Embedding Training Various models for learning word embeddings have been proposed, including neural net language models (Bengio et al., 2003; Mnih and Hinton, 2008; Mikolov et al., 2013b) and spectral models (Dhillon et al., 2011). More recently, Mikolov et al. (2013a) propose two log-linear models, namely the Skip-gram and CBOW model, to efficiently induce word embeddings. These two models can be trained very efficiently on a large-scale corpus because of their low time complexity. No. Examples 1","v(虾) − v(对虾) ≈ v(鱼) − v(金鱼) v(shrimp) − v(prawn) ≈ v(fish) − v(gold fish) 2","v(工人) − v(木匠) ≈ v(演员) − v(小丑) v(laborer) − v(carpenter) ≈ v(actor) − v(clown) 3","v(工人) − v(木匠) ̸≈ v(鱼) − v(金鱼) v(laborer) − v(carpenter) ̸≈ v(fish) − v(gold fish) Table 1: Embedding offsets on a sample of hypernym–hyponym word pairs. Additionally, their experiment results have shown that the Skip-gram model performs best in identifying semantic relationship among words. Therefore, we employ the Skip-gram model for estimat-ing word embeddings in this study.","The Skip-gram model adopts log-linear classifiers to predict context words given the current word w(t) as input. First, w(t) is projected to its embedding. Then, log-linear classifiers are employed, taking the embedding as input and predict w(t)’s context words within a certain range, e.g. k words in the left and k words in the right. After maximizing the log-likelihood over the entire dataset using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the embeddings are learned. 3.3 Projection Learning Mikolov et al. (2013b) observe that word embeddings preserve interesting linguistic regularities, capturing a considerable amount of syntactic/semantic relations. Looking at the well-known example: v(king) − v(queen) ≈ v(man) − v(woman), it indicates that the embedding offsets indeed represent the shared semantic relation between the two word pairs.","We observe that the same property also applies to some hypernym–hyponym relations. As a preliminary experiment, we compute the embedding offsets between some randomly sampled hypernym–hyponym word pairs and measure their similarities. The results are shown in Table 1.","The first two examples imply that a word can also be mapped to its hypernym by utilizing word embedding offsets. However, the offset from “ carpenter” to “ laborer” is distant from the one from “ gold fish” to “ fish,” indicat-ing that hypernym–hyponym relations should be more complicated than a single vector offset can represent. To verify this hypothesis, we compute the embedding offsets over all hypernym– 1201 运动员-足球球员 sportsman - footballer 职员-公务员 staff - civil servant 工人-园丁 laborer - gardener","海员-领航员","seaman - navigator","演员-歌手","actor - singer","演员-主角 actor - protagonist演员-小丑","actor - clown","职位-校长 position - headmaster 演员-斗牛士 actor - matador","工人-临时工 laborer - temporary worker 工人-木匠 laborer - carpenter","职位-总领事 position – consul general","职员-空姐","staff - airline hostess职员-售货员","staff - salesclerk","职员-售票员","staff - conductor鸡-公鸡","chicken - cock 羊-小尾寒羊","sheep - small-tail Han sheep 羊-公羊 sheep - ram 马-斑马 equus - zebra 虾-对虾 shrimp - prawn 狗-警犬","dog - police dog","兔-长毛兔 rabbit - wool rabbit","海豚-白鳍豚 dolphin - white-flag dolphin","鱼-鲨鱼","fish - shark 鱼-热带鱼 fish - tropical fish鱼-金鱼 fish - gold fish 蟹-海蟹 crab - sea crab","驴-野驴 donkey - wild ass Figure 2: Clusters of the vector offsets in training data.

Moreover, the relations about animals are spatially close, but separate from the relations about people’s occupations.","To address this challenge, we propose to learn the hypernym–hyponym relations using projection matrices. 3.3.1 A Uniform Linear Projection Intuitively, we assume that all words can be projected to their hypernyms based on a uniform transition matrix. That is, given a word x and its hypernym y, there exists a matrix Φ so that y = Φx. For simplicity, we use the same symbols as the words to represent the embedding vectors. Obtaining a consistent exact Φ for the projection of all hypernym–hyponym pairs is difficult. Instead, we can learn an approximate Φ using Equation 1 on the training data, which minimizes the meansquared error:","Φ∗ = arg min","Φ 1 N ∑ (x,y)","∥ Φx − y ∥2 (1) where N is the number of (x, y) word pairs in the training data. This is a typical linear regression problem. The only difference is that our predictions are multi-dimensional vectors instead of scalar values. We use SGD for optimization. 2 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for di-","mensionality reduction. 3.3.2 Piecewise Linear Projections A uniform linear projection may still be underrepresentative for fitting all of the hypernym– hyponym word pairs, because the relations are rather diverse, as shown in Figure 2. To better model the various kinds of hypernym–hyponym relations, we apply the idea of piecewise linear regression (Ritzema, 1994) in this study.","Specifically, the input space is first segmented into several regions. That is, all word pairs (x, y) in the training data are first clustered into several groups, where word pairs in each group are expected to exhibit similar hypernym–hyponym relations. Each word pair (x, y) is represented with their vector offsets: y − x for clustering. The reasons are twofold: (1) Mikolov’s work has shown that the vector offsets imply a certain level of semantic relationship. (2) The vector offsets distribute in clusters well, and the word pairs which are close indeed represent similar relations, as shown in Figure 2.","Then we learn a separate projection for each cluster, respectively (Equation 2). Φ∗ k = arg min","Φk 1 Nk ∑ (x,y)∈Ck","∥ Φkx − y ∥2 (2) where Nk is the amount of word pairs in the kth cluster Ck.","We use the k-means algorithm for clustering, where k is tuned on a development dataset. 3.3.3 Training Data To learn the projection matrices, we extract training data from a Chinese semantic thesaurus, Tongyi Cilin (Extended) (CilinE for short) which 1202 ... ... ... ... ...

Each word in CilinE has one or more sense codes (some words are polysemous) that indicate its position in the hierarchy.","The senses of words in the first level, such as “ 物 (object)” and “ 时间 (time),” are very general. The fourth level only has sense codes without real words. Therefore, we extract words in the second, third and fifth levels to constitute hypernym– hyponym pairs (left panel, Figure 3).","Note that mapping one hyponym to multiple hypernyms with the same projection (Φx is unique) is difficult. Therefore, the pairs with the same hyponym but different hypernyms are expected to be clustered into separate groups. Figure 3 shows that the word “ dragonfly” in the fifth level has two hypernyms: “insect” in the third level and “ animal” in the second level. Hence the relations dragonfly H −→ insect and dragonfly H −→ animal should fall into different clusters.","In our implementation, we apply this constraint by simply dividing the training data into two categories, namely, direct and indirect. Hypernym-hyponym word pair (x, y) is classified into thedirect category, only if there doesn’t exist another word z in the training data, which is a hypernym of x and a hyponym of y. Otherwise, (x, y) is classified into theindirect category. Then, data in these two categories are clustered separately. 3 www.ltp-cloud.com/download/"]},{"title":"x y Φ","paragraphs":["k δ"]},{"title":"x' Φ","paragraphs":["l Figure 4: In this example, Φkx is located in the circle with center y and radius δ.

Given two words x and y, we find cluster Ck whose center is closest to the offset y − x, and obtain the corresponding projection Φk. For y to be considered a hypernym of x, one of the two conditions below must hold.","Condition 1: The projection Φk puts Φkx close enough to y (Figure 4). Formally, the euclidean distance between Φkx and y: d(Φkx, y) must be less than a threshold δ.","d(Φkx, y) =∥ Φkx − y ∥2 < δ (3)","Condition 2: There exists another word z satisfying x H −→z and z","H","−→y. In this case, we use the transitivity of hypernym–hyponym relations.","Besides, the final hierarchy should be a DAG as discussed in Section 3.1. However, the projection method cannot guarantee that theoretically, because the projections are learned from pairwise hypernym–hyponym relations without the w-hole hierarchy structure. All pairwise hypernym– hyponym relation identification methods would suffer from this problem actually. It is an interesting problem how to construct a globally opti-1203 mal semantic hierarchy conforming to the form of a DAG. But this is not the focus of this paper. So if some conflicts occur, that is, a relation circle exists, we remove or reverse the weakest path heuristically (Figure 5). If a circle has only two nodes, we remove the weakest path. If a circle has more than two nodes, we reverse the weakest path to form an indirect hypernym–hyponym relation."]},{"title":"4 Experimental Setup 4.1 Experimental Data","paragraphs":["In this work, we learn word embeddings from a Chinese encyclopedia corpus named Baidubaike4",", which contains about 30 million sentences (about 780 million words). The Chinese segmentation is provided by the open-source Chinese language processing platform LTP5","(Che et al., 2010). Then, we employ the Skip-gram method (Section 3.2) to train word embeddings. Finally we obtain the embedding vectors of 0.56 million words.","The training data for projection learning is collected from CilinE (Section 3.3.3). We obtain 15,247 word pairs of hypernym–hyponym relations (9,288 for direct relations and 5,959 for indirect relations).","For evaluation, we collect the hypernyms for 418 entities, which are selected randomly from Baidubaike, following Fu et al.

The final data set contains 655 unique hypernyms and 1,391 hypernym–hyponym relations among them. We randomly split the labeled data into 1/5 for development and 4/5 for testing (Table 2). The hierarchies are represented as relations of pairwise words. We measure the inter-annotator agreement using the kappa coefficient (Siegel and Castellan Jr, 1988). The kappa value is 0.96, which indicates a good strength of agreement. 4.2 Evaluation Metrics We use precision, recall, and F-score as our metrics to evaluate the performances of the methods.","Since hypernym–hyponym relations and its reverse (hyponym–hypernym) have one-to-one correspondence, their performances are equal.

Table 3 shows that this method achieves a high precision but also a low recall, mainly because of the limited scope of Wikipedia.","MP attern refers to the pattern-based method of Hearst (1992). We extract hypernym–hyponym relations in the Baidubaike corpus, which is also used to train word embeddings (Section 4.1). We use the Chinese Hearst-style patterns (Table 4) proposed by Fu et al. (2013), in which w represents a word, and h represents one of its hypernyms. The result shows that only a small part of the hypernyms can be extracted based on these patterns because only a few hypernym relations are expressed in these fixed patterns, and many are expressed in highly flexible manners.","In the same corpus, we apply the method MSnow originally proposed by Snow et al.

Lexico-syntactic patterns are extracted from the Baidubaike corpus by using the seeds. We then develop a logistic regression classifier based on the patterns to recognize hypernym–hyponym relations. This method relies on an accurate syntactic parser, and the quality of the automatically extracted patterns is difficult to guarantee.","We re-implement two previous distributional methods MbalApinc (Kotlerman et al., 2010) and MinvCL (Lenci and Benotto, 2012) in the Baidubaike corpus. Each word is represented as a feature vector in which each dimension is the PMI value of the word and its context words. We compute a score for each word pair and apply a threshold to identify whether it is a hypernym–hyponym relation.","MF u refers to our previous web mining method (Fu et al., 2013). This method mines hypernyms of a given word w from multiple sources and returns a ranked list of the hypernyms. We select the hypernyms with scores over a threshold of each word in the test set for evaluation. This method assumes that frequent co-occurrence of a noun or noun phrase n in multiple sources with w indicate possibility of n being a hypernym of w. The results presented in Fu et al. (2013) show that the method works well when w is an entity, but not when w is a word with a common semantic concept. The main reason may be that there are relatively more introductory pages about entities than about common words in the Web.","MEmb is the proposed method based on word embeddings.

We can see that there is only one general relation “ 植物 (plant)” H −→ “ 生物 (organism)” existing in CilinE. Some fine-grained relations exist in Wikipedia, but the coverage is limited. Our method based on word embeddings can discover more hypernym– hyponym relations than the previous methods can. When we combine the methods together, we get the correct hierarchy.","Figure 8 shows that our method loses the relation “ 乌 头 属 (Aconitum)”","H","−→ “ 毛 茛 科 (Ranunculaceae).” It is because they are very semantically similar (their cosine similarity is 0.9038). Their representations are so close to each other in the embedding space that we have not find projections suitable for these pairs. The 1206 error statistics show that when the cosine similarities of word pairs are greater than 0.8, the recall is only 9.5%. This kind of error accounted for about 10.9% among all the errors in our test set. One possible solution may be adding more data of this kind to the training set."]},{"title":"6 Related Work","paragraphs":["In addition to the works mentioned in Section 2, we introduce another set of related studies in this section.","Evans (2004), Ortega-Mendoza et al. (2007), and Sang (2007) consider web data as a large corpus and use search engines to identify hypernyms based on the lexical patterns of Hearst (1992). However, the low quality of the sentences in the search results negatively influence the precision of hypernym extraction.","Following the method for discovering patterns automatically (Snow et al., 2005), McNamee et al. (2008) apply the same method to extract hypernyms of entities in order to improve the performance of a question answering system. Ritter et al. (2009) propose a method based on patterns to find hypernyms on arbitrary noun phrases. They use a support vector machine classifier to identify the correct hypernyms from the candidates that match the patterns. As our experiments show, pattern-based methods suffer from low recall because of the low coverage of patterns.","Besides Kotlerman et al. (2010) and Lenci and Benotto (2012), other researchers also propose directional distributional similarity methods (Weeds et al., 2004; Geffet and Dagan, 2005; Bhagat et al., 2007; Szpektor et al., 2007; Clarke, 2009). However, their basic assumption that a hyponym can only be used in contexts where its hypernyms can be used and that a hypernym might be used in all of the contexts where its hyponyms are used may not always rational.","Snow et al. (2006) provides a global optimiza-tion scheme for extending WordNet, which is different from the above-mentioned pairwise relationships identification methods.","Word embeddings have been successfully applied in many applications, such as in sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2011b), paraphrase detec-tion (Socher et al., 2011a), chunking, and named entity recognition (Turian et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011). These applications mainly utilize the representing power of word embeddings to al-leviate the problem of data sparsity. Mikolov et al. (2013a) and Mikolov et al. (2013b) further observe that the semantic relationship of words can be induced by performing simple algebraic operations with word vectors. Their work indicates that word embeddings preserve some interesting linguistic regularities, which might provide support for many applications. In this paper, we improve on their work by learning multiple linear projections in the embedding space, to model hypernym–hyponym relationships within different clusters."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["This paper proposes a novel method for semantic hierarchy construction based on word embeddings, which are trained using a large-scale corpus. Using the word embeddings, we learn the hypernym–hyponym relationship by estimat-ing projection matrices which map words to their hypernyms. Further improvements are made using a cluster-based approach in order to model the more fine-grained relations. Then we propose a few simple criteria to identity whether a new word pair is a hypernym–hyponym relation. Based on the pairwise hypernym–hyponym relations, we build semantic hierarchies automatically.","In our experiments, the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves the best F1-score of 73.74% on a manually labeled test dataset. Further experiments show that our method is complementary to the previous manually-built hierarchy extension methods.","For future work, we aim to improve word embedding learning under the guidance of hypernym–hyponym relations. By including the hypernym–hyponym relation constraints while training word embeddings, we expect to improve the embeddings such that they become more suitable for this task."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) via grant 61133012, 61273321 and the National 863 Leading Technology Research Project via grant 2012AA011102.
