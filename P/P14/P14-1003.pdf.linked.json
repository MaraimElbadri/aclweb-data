In this paper, we present the limitations of constituency based discourse parsing and first propose to use dependency structure to directly represent the relations between elementary discourse units (EDUs). The state-of-the-art dependency parsing techniques, the Eisner algorithm and maximum spanning tree (MST) algorithm, are adopted to parse an optimal discourse dependency tree based on the arc-factored model and the large-margin learning techniques. Experiments show that our discourse dependency parsers achieve a competitive performance on text-level discourse parsing."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["It is widely agreed that no units of the text can be understood in isolation, but in relation to their context. Researches in discourse parsing aim to acquire such relations in text, which is fundamental to many natural language processing applications such as question answering, automatic summarization and so on.","One important issue behind discourse parsing is the representation of discourse structure. Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988), one of the most influential discourse theories, posits a hierarchical generative tree representation, as illustrated in Figure 1. The leaves of a tree correspond to contiguous text spans called Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs)1",". The adjacent EDUs are combined into  1 EDU segmentation is a relatively trivial step in discourse parsing. Since our work focus here is not EDU segmentation but discourse parsing. We assume EDUs are already known. the larger text spans by rhetorical relations (e.g., Contrast and Elaboration) and the larger text spans continue to be combined until the whole text constitutes a parse tree. The text spans linked by rhetorical relations are annotated as either nucleus or satellite depending on how salient they are for interpretation. It is attractive and challenging to parse the whole text into one tree.","Since such a hierarchical discourse tree is analogous to a constituency based syntactic tree except that the constituents in the discourse trees are text spans, previous researches have explored different constituency based syntactic parsing techniques (eg. CKY and chart parsing) and various features (eg. length, position et al.) for discourse parsing (Soricut and Marcu, 2003; Joty et al., 2012; Reitter, 2003; LeThanh et al., 2004; Baldridge and Lascarides, 2005; Subba and Di Eugenio, 2009; Sagae, 2009; Hernault et al., 2010b; Feng and Hirst, 2012). However, the existing approaches suffer from at least one of the following three problems. First, it is difficult to design a set of production rules as in syntactic parsing, since there are no determinate generative rules for the interior text spans. Second, the different levels of discourse units (e.g. EDUs or larger text spans) occurring in the generative process are better represented with different features, and thus a uniform framework for discourse analysis is hard to develop. Third, to reduce the time complexity of the state-of-the-art constituency based parsing techniques, the approximate parsing approaches are prone to trap in local maximum.","In this paper, we propose to adopt the dependency structure in discourse representation to overcome the limitations mentioned above. Here is the basic idea: the discourse structure consists of EDUs which are linked by the binary, asymmetrical relations called dependency relations. A dependency relation holds between a subordinate EDU called the dependent, and another EDU on 25 which it depends called the head, as illustrated in Figure 2. Each EDU has one head. So, the dependency structure can be seen as a set of head-dependent links, which are labeled by functional relations. Now, we can analyze the relations between EDUs directly, without worrying about any interior text spans. Since dependency trees contain much fewer nodes and on average they are simpler than constituency based trees, the current dependency parsers can have a relatively low computational complexity. Moreover, concerning linearization, it is well known that dependency structures can deal with non-projective relations, while constituency-based models need the addition of complex mechanisms like transformations, movements and so on. In our work, we adopt the graph based dependency parsing techniques learned from large sets of annotated dependency trees. The Eisner (1996) algorithm and maximum spanning tree (MST) algorithm are used respectively to parse the optimal projective and non-projective dependency trees with the large-margin learning technique (Crammer and Singer, 2003). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply the dependency structure and introduce the dependency parsing techniques into discourse analysis.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formally defines discourse dependency structure and introduces how to build a discourse dependency treebank from the existing RST corpus. Section 3 presents the discourse parsing approach based on the Eisner and MST algorithms. Section 4 elaborates on the large-margin learning technique as well as the features we use. Section 5 discusses the experimental results. Section 6 introduces the related work and Section 7 concludes the paper. e1 e2 e1-e2* e3","e1-e2* -e3 e1 e2 e1-e2* e3 e1-e2-e3* e1 e2","e1* -e2 e3 e1-e2-e3* e1 e2","e1* -e2 e3","e1* -e2-e3 e1 e2","e2* -e3 e3","e1-e2* -e3 e1 e2 e3 e1 e2 e3","e1* -e2-e3","e2* -e3 e2-e3*","e1* -e2-e3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8e1 e2 e3 e1-e2-e3* e2-e3*","","Figure 1: Headed Constituency based Discourse Tree Structure (e1,e2 and e3 denote three EDUs, and * denotes the NUCLEUS constituent) e1 e2 e3 e1 e2 e3 e1 e2 e3 e1 e2 e3","e1 e2 e3e1 e2 e3 e1 e2 e3e1 e2 e3 1' 2' 3' 4' 5' 6' 7' 8' 9'e1 e2 e3 e0e0 e0 e0 e0 e0 e0 e0 e0","","Figure 2: Discourse Dependency Tree Structures (e1,e2 and e3 denote three EDUS, and the directed arcs denote one dependency relations.

This treatment will simplify both formal definitions and computational implementations. Normally, we assume that each EDU should have one and only one head except for e0. A labeled directed arc is used to represent the dependency relation from one head to its dependent. Then, discourse dependency structure can be formalized as the labeled directed graph, where nodes correspond to EDUs and labeled arcs correspond to labeled dependency relations. 26 We assume that the text 2","T is composed of n+1 EDUs including the artificial e0.

It is costly to manually construct such a treebank from scratch. Fortunately, RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DT) (Carlson et al., 2001) is an available resource to help with.","A RST tree constitutes a hierarchical structure for one document through rhetorical relations. A total of 110 fine-grained relations (e.g. Elaboration-part-whole and List) were used for tagging RST-DT. They can be categorized into 18 classes (e.g. Elaboration and Joint). All these relations can be hypotactic (“mononuclear”) or paratactic (“multi-nuclear”). A hypotactic relation holds between a nucleus span and an adjacent satellite span, while a paratactic relation connects two or more equally important adjacent nucleus spans. For convenience of computation, we convert the n-ary (n>2) RST trees 3","to binary trees through adding a new node for the latter n-1 nodes and assume each relation is connected to only one nucleus4",". This departure from the original theory  2 The two terms “text” and “document” are used interchangeably and represent the same meaning. 3 According to our statistics, there are totally 381 n-ary relations in RST-DT. 4 We set the first nucleus as the only nucleus. is not such a major step as it may appear, since any nucleus is known to contribute to the essential meaning. Now, each RST tree can be seen as a headed constituency based binary tree where the nuclei are heads and the children of each node are linearly ordered. Given three EDUs 5",", Figure 1 shows the possible 8 headed constituency based trees where the superscript * denotes the heads (nuclei). We use dependency trees to simulate the headed constituency based trees.","Contrasting Figure 1 with Figure 2, we use dependency tree 1’ to simulate binary trees 1 and 8, and dependency tress 2’- 7’ to simulate binary trees 2-7 correspondingly. The rhetorical relations in RST trees are kept as the functional relations which link the two EDUs in dependency trees. With this kind of conversion, we can get our discourse dependency treebank.

The basic idea of the Eisner algorithm is to parse the left and right dependents of an EDU independently and combine them at a later stage. This reduces the overhead of index-ing heads. Only two binary variables, i.e. c and d, are required to specify whether the heads occur leftmost or rightmost and whether an item is complete.

A dynamic programming table E[i,j,d,c] is used to represent the highest scored subtree spanning ei to ej. d indicates whether ei is the head (d=1) or ej is head (d=0). c indicates whether the subtree will not take any more dependents (c=1) or it needs to be completed (c=0). The algorithm begins by initializing all length-one subtrees to a score of 0.0. In the inner loop, the first two steps (Lines 7 and 8) are to construct the new dependency arcs by taking the maximum over all the internal indices (iqj) in the span, and calculating the value of merging the two subtrees and adding one new arc. The last two steps (Lines 10 and 11) attempt to achieve an optimal left/right subtree in the span by adding the corresponding left/right subtree to the arcs that have been added previously. This algorithm considers all the possible subtrees. We can then get the optimal dependency tree with the score E[0,n,1,1] ."]},{"title":"3.3 Maximum Spanning Tree Algorithm","paragraphs":["As the bottom-up Eisner Algorithm must maintain the nested structural constraint, it cannot parse the non-projective dependency trees like 8’ and 9’ in Figure 2. However, the non-projective dependency does exist in real discourse. For example, the earlier text mainly talks about the topic A with mentioning the topic B, while the latter text gives a supplementary explanation for the topic B. This example can constitute a non-projective tree and its pictorial diagram is exhibited in Figure 4.

Figure 5 shows the details of the Chu-Liu/Edmonds algorithm for discourse parsing. Each node in the graph greedily selects the incoming arc with the highest score. If one tree results, the algorithm ends. Otherwise, there must exist a cycle. The algorithm contracts the identified cycle into a single node and recalculates the scores of the arcs which go in and out of the cycle. Next, the algorithm recursively call itself on the contracted graph. Finally, those arcs which go in or out of one cycle will recover themselves to connect with the original nodes in V.

Each row denotes one feature: the left part before the symbol “&” is from one of the 6 feature types and the right part denotes a specific relation. From Table 5 and Table 6, we can see that some features are reasonable. For example, The sixth feature in Table 5 represents that the dependency relation is preferred to be labeled Explanation with the fact that “because” is the first word of the dependent EDU. From these two tables, we also observe that most of the heavily weighted features are usually related to those highly distributed relations. When using the coarse-grained relations, the popular relations (eg. Elaboration, Attribution and Joint) are always preferred to be labeled. When using the fine-grained relations, the large relations including List and Elaboration-object-attribute-e are given the precedence of labeling. This phenomenon is mainly caused by the sparseness of the training corpus and the imbalance of relations. To solve this problem, the augment of training corpus is necessary."," Feature description Weight 1 Last two words in dependent EDU are","“appeals court” & Joint 0.475 2 First word in dependent EDU is “racked” & Elaboration 0.445 3 First two words in head EDU are “I ‘d” & Attribution 0.324 4 Last word in dependent EDU is “in” & Elaboration -0.323 5 The res_similarity between two EDUs is 0 & Elaboration 0.322","6 First word in dependent EDU is “because” & Explanation 0.306 7 First POS in head EDU is “DT” & Joint -0.299 8 First two words in dependent EDU are “that required” & Elaboration 0.287 9 First two words in dependent EDU are “that the” & Elaboration 0.277","10 First word in dependent EDU is “because” & Cause 0.265 Table 5: Top 10 Feature Weights for Coarse-grained Relation Labeling (Eisner Algorithm) Features Weight 1 Last two words in dependent EDU are “ap-","peals court” & List 0.576 2 First two words in head EDU are “I ‘d”","& Attribution 0.385 3 First two words in dependent EDU is “that","the” & Elaboration-object-attribute-e 0.348 4 First POS in head EDU is “DT” & List -0.323 5 Last word in dependent EDU is “in” & List -0.286 6 First word in dependent EDU is “racked” &","Elaboration-object-attribute-e 0.445","7 First two word pairs are <”In an”,”But even”> & List -0.252","8 Dependent EDU has a dominating node tagged “CD”& Elaboration-object-attribute-e -0.244 9 First two words in dependent EDU are “pa-","tents disputes” & Purpose 0.231 10 First word in dependent EDU is “to”","& Purpose 0.230 Table 6: Top 10 Feature Weights for Coarse-grained Relation Labeling (Eisner Algorithm)","Unlike previous discourse parsing approaches, our methods combine tree building and relation labeling into a uniform framework naturally. This means that relations play a role in building the dependency tree structure. From Table 3 and Table 4, we can see that fine-grained relations are more helpful to building unlabeled discourse 31 trees more than the coarse-grained relations. The best result of unlabeled accuracy using 111 relations is 0.7506, better than the best performance (0.7447) using 19 relations. We can also see that the labeled accuracy using the fine-grained relations can achieve 0.4309, only 0.06 lower than the best labeled accuracy (0.4915) using the coarse-grained relations.","In addition, comparing the MST algorithm with the Eisner algorithm, Table 3 and Table 4 show that their performances are not significantly different from each other. But we think that MST algorithm has more potential in discourse dependency parsing, because our converted discourse dependency treebank contains only projective trees and somewhat suppresses the MST algorithm to exhibit its advantage of parsing non-projective trees. In fact, we observe that some non-projective dependencies produced by the MST algorithm are even reasonable than what they are in the dependency treebank. Thus, it is important to build a manually labeled discourse dependency treebank, which will be our future work."]},{"title":"5.3 Comparison with Other Systems","paragraphs":["The state-of-the-art discourse parsing methods normally produce the constituency based discourse trees. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of a labeled constituency tree, the blank tree structure (‘S’), the tree structure with nuclearity indication (‘N’), and the tree structure with rhetorical relation indication but no nuclearity indication (‘R’) are evaluated respectively using the F measure (Marcu 2000).","To compare our discourse parsers with others, we adopt MIRA and Eisner algorithm to conduct discourse parsing with all the 6 types of features and then convert the produced projective dependency trees to constituency based trees through their correspondence as stated in Section 2. Our parsers using two relation sets are named Our-coarse and Our-fine respectively. The inputted EDUs of our parsers are from the standard segmentation of RST-DT. Other text-level discourse parsing methods include: (1) Percep-coarse: we replace MIRA with the averaged perceptron learning algorithm and the other settings are the same with Our-coarse; (2) HILDA-manual and HILDA-seg are from Hernault (2010b)’s work, and their inputted EDUs are from RST-DT and their own EDU segmenter respectively; (3) LeThanh indicates the results given by LeThanh el al. (2004), which built a multi-level rule based parser and used 14 relations evaluated on 21 documents from RST-DT; (4) Marcu denotes the results given by Marcu(2000)’s decision-tree based parser which used 15 relations evaluated on unspecified documents.","Table 7 shows the performance comparison for all the parsers mentioned above. Human denotes the manual agreement between two human annotators. From this table, we can see that both our parsers perform better than all the other parsers as a whole, though our parsers are not developed directly for constituency based trees. Our parsers do not exhibit obvious advantage than HILDA-manual on labeling the blank tree structure, because our parsers and HILDA-manual all perform over 94% of Human and this performance level somewhat reaches a bottleneck to promote more. However, our parsers outperform the other parsers on both nuclearity and relation labeling. Our-coarse achieves 94.2% and 91.8% of the human F-scores, on labeling nuclearity and relation respectively, while Our-fine achieves 95.2% and 87.6%. We can also see that the averaged perceptron learning algorithm, though simple, can achieve a comparable performance, better than HILDA-manual. The parsers HILDA-seg, LeThanh and Marcu use their own automatic EDU segmenters and exhibit a relatively low performance. This means that EDU segmentation is important to a practical discourse parser and worth further investigation.","","S N R","Our-coarse 82.9 73.0 60.6","Our-fine 83.4 73.8 57.8","Percep-coarse 82.3 72.6 59.4","HILDA-manual 83.0 68.4 55.3","HILDA-seg 72.3 59.1 47.8","LeThanh 53.7 47.1 39.9","Marcu 44.8 30.9 18.8","Human 88.1 77.5 66.0","Table 7: Full Parser Evaluation MAFS WAFS Acc Our-coarse 0.454 0.643 66.84 Percep-coarse 0.438 0.633 65.37 Feng 0.440 0.607 65.30 HILDA-manual 0.428 0.604 64.18 Baseline - - 35.82","Table 8: Relation Labeling Performance","To further compare the performance of relation labeling, we follow Hernault el al. (2010a) and use Macro-averaged F-score (MAFS) to evaluate each relation. Due to space limitation, we do not list the F scores for each relation. Macro-averaged F-score is not influenced by the number of instances that are contained in each 32 relation. Weight-averaged F-score (WAFS) weights the performance of each relation by the number of its existing instances. Table 8 compares our parser Our-coarse with other parsers HILDA-manual, Feng (Feng and Hirst, 2012) and Baseline. Feng (Feng and Hirst, 2012) can be seen as a strengthened version of HILDA which adopts more features and conducts feature selection. Baseline always picks the most frequent relation (i.e. Elaboration). From the results, we find that Our-coarse consistently provides superior performance for most relations over other parsers, and therefore results in higher MAFS and WAFS."]},{"title":"6 Related Work","paragraphs":["So far, the existing discourse parsing techniques are mainly based on two well-known treebanks. One is the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2007) and the other is RST-DT.","PDTB adopts the predicate-arguments representation by taking an implicit/explicit connec-tive as a predication of two adjacent sentences (arguments). Then the discourse relation between each pair of sentences is annotated independently to characterize its predication. A majority of researches regard discourse parsing as a classification task and mainly focus on exploiting various linguistic features and classifiers when using PDTB (Wellner et al., 2006; Pitler et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010). However, the predicate-arguments annotation scheme itself has such a limitation that one can only obtain the local discourse relations without knowing the rich context.","In contrast, RST and its treebank enable people to derive a complete representation of the whole discourse. Researches have begun to in-vestigate how to construct a RST tree for the given text. Since the RST tree is similar to the constituency based syntactic tree except that the constituent nodes are different, the syntactic parsing techniques have been borrowed for discourse parsing (Soricut and Marcu, 2003; Baldridge and Lascarides, 2005; Sagae, 2009; Hernault et al., 2010b; Feng and Hirst, 2012). Soricut and Marcu (2003) use a standard bottom-up chart parsing algorithm to determine the discourse structure of sentences. Baldridge and Lascarides (2005) model the process of discourse parsing with the probabilistic head driven parsing techniques. Sagae (2009) apply a transition based constituent parsing approach to construct a RST tree for a document. Hernault et al. (2010b) develop a greedy bottom-up tree building strategy for discourse parsing. The two adjacent text spans with the closest relations are combined in each iteration. As the extension of Hernault’s work, Feng and Hirst (2012) further explore various features aiming to achieve better performance. However, as analyzed in Section 1, there exist three limitations with the constituency based discourse representation and parsing. We innovatively adopt the dependency structure, which can be benefited from the existing RST-DT, to represent the discourse. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply dependency structure and dependency parsing techniques in discourse analysis."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this paper, we present the benefits and feasibility of applying dependency structure in text-level discourse parsing. Through the correspondence between constituency-based trees and dependency trees, we build a discourse dependency treebank by converting the existing RST-DT. Based on dependency structure, we are able to directly analyze the relations between the EDUs without worrying about the additional interior text spans, and apply the existing state-of-the-art dependency parsing techniques which have a relatively low time complexity. In our work, we use the graph based dependency parsing techniques learned from the annotated dependency trees. The Eisner algorithm and the MST algorithm are applied to parse the optimal projective and non-projective dependency trees respectively based on the arc-factored model. To calculate the score for each arc, six types of features are explored to represent the arcs and the feature weights are learned based on the MIRA learning technique. Experimental results exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. In the future, we will focus on non-projective discourse dependency parsing and explore more effective features."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was partially supported by National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (No. 2012AA011101), National Key Basic Research Program of China (No. 2014CB340504), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61273278), and National Key Technology R&D Program (No: 2011BAH10B04-03).
