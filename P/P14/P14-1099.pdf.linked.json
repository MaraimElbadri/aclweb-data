The standard approach to parameter estimation in L-PCFGs is the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977), which has the usual problems with local optima. Recent work (Cohen et al., 2012) has introduced an alternative algorithm, based on spectral methods, which has provable guarantees. Unfortunately this algorithm does not return parameter estimates for the underlying L-PCFG, instead returning the parameter values up to an (unknown) linear trans-form. In practice, this is a limitation.","We describe an algorithm that, like EM, returns estimates of the original parameters of an L-PCFG, but, unlike EM, does not suffer from problems of local optima. The algorithm relies on two key ideas:","1) A matrix decomposition algorithm (section 5) which is applicable to matrices Q of the form Qf,g =","∑","h p(h)p(f | h)p(g | h) where p(h), p(f | h) and p(g | h) are multinomial distributions. This matrix form has clear relevance to latent variable models. We apply the matrix decomposition algorithm to a co-occurrence matrix that can be estimated directly from a training set consisting of parse trees without latent annotations. The resulting parameter estimates give us significant leverage over the learning problem.","2) Optimization of a convex objective function using EM. We show that once the matrix decomposition step has been applied, parameter estimation of the L-PCFG can be reduced to a convex optimization problem that is easily solved by EM.","The algorithm provably learns the parameters of an L-PCFG (theorem 1), under an assumption that each latent state has at least one “pivot” feature. This assumption is similar to the “pivot word” assumption used by Arora et al. (2013) and Arora et al. (2012) in the context of learning topic models.","We describe experiments on learning of L-PCFGs, and also on learning of the latent-variable language model of Saul and Pereira (1997). A hybrid method, which uses our algorithm as an initializer for EM, performs at the same accuracy as EM, but requires significantly fewer iterations for convergence: for example in our L-PCFG experiments, it typically requires 2 EM iterations for convergence, as opposed to 20-40 EM iterations for initializers used in previous work.","While this paper’s focus is on L-PCFGs, the techniques we describe are likely to be applicable to many other latent-variable models used in NLP."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Recently a number of researchers have developed provably correct algorithms for parameter estimation in latent variable models such as hidden Markov models, topic models, directed graphical models with latent variables, and so on (Hsu et al., 2009; Bailly et al., 2010; Siddiqi et al., 2010; Parikh et al., 2011; Balle et al., 2011; Arora et al., 2013; Dhillon et al., 2012; Anandkumar et al., 2012; Arora et al., 2012; Arora et al., 2013). Many of these algorithms have their roots in spectral methods such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) (Hotelling, 1936), or higher-order tensor decompositions. Previous work (Cohen et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2013) has developed a spectral method for learning of L-PCFGs; this method learns parameters of the model up to an unknown 1052 linear transformation, which cancels in the inside-outside calculations for marginalization over latent states in the L-PCFG. The lack of direct parameter estimates from this method leads to problems with negative or unnormalized probablities; the method does not give parameters that are interpretable, or that can be used in conjunction with other algorithms, for example as an initializer for EM steps that refine the model.","Our work is most directly related to the algorithm for parameter estimation in topic models described by Arora et al. (2013). This algorithm forms the core of the matrix decomposition algorithm described in section 5."]},{"title":"3 Background","paragraphs":["This section gives definitions and notation for L-PCFGs, taken from (Cohen et al., 2012). 3.1 L-PCFGs: Basic Definitions An L-PCFG is an 8-tuple (N , I, P, m, n, π, t, q) where: N is the set of non-terminal symbols in the grammar. I ⊂ N is a finite set of in-terminals. P ⊂ N is a finite set of pre-terminals. We assume that N = I ∪ P, and I ∩ P = ∅. Hence we have partitioned the set of non-terminals into two subsets. [m] is the set of possible hidden states.1","[n] is the set of possible words. For all (a, b, c) ∈ I × N × N , and (h1, h2, h3) ∈ [m] × [m] × [m], we have a context-free rule a(h1) → b(h2) c(h3). The rule has an associated parameter t(a → b c, h2, h3 | a, h1). For all a ∈ P, h ∈ [m], x ∈ [n], we have a context-free rule a(h) → x. The rule has an associated parameter q(a → x | a, h). For all a ∈ I, h ∈ [m], π(a, h) is a parameter specifying the probability of a(h) being at the root of a tree.","A skeletal tree (s-tree) is a sequence of rules r1 . . . rN where each ri is either of the form a → b c or a → x. The rule sequence forms a top-down, left-most derivation under a CFG with skeletal rules.","A full tree consists of an s-tree r1 . . . rN , to-gether with values h1 . . . hN . Each hi is the value for the hidden variable for the left-hand-side of rule ri. Each hi can take any value in [m].","For a given skeletal tree r1 . . . rN , define ai to be the non-terminal on the left-hand-side of rule ri. For any i ∈ [N ] such that ri is of the form a → b c, define h(2)","i and h(3)","i as the hidden state 1 For any integer n, we use [n] to denote the set","{1, 2, . . . n}. value of the left and right child respectively. The model then defines a distribution as p(r1 . . . rN , h1 . . . hN ) = π(a1, h1) ∏","i:a i∈I","t(ri, h(2) i , h(3)","i | ai, hi) ∏","i:a i∈P q(ri | ai, hi)","The distribution over skeletal trees is p(r1 . . . rN ) =","∑ h1...hN p(r1 . . . rN , h1 . . . hN ). 3.2 Definition of Random Variables Throughout this paper we will make reference to random variables derived from the distribution over full trees from an L-PCFG. These random variables are defined as follows. First, we select a random internal node, from a random tree, as follows: 1) Sample a full tree r1 . . . rN , h1 . . . hN from the PMF p(r1 . . . rN , h1 . . . hN ); 2) Choose a node i uniformly at random from [N ]. We then give the following definition: Definition 1 (Random Variables). If the rule ri for the node i is of the form a → b c, we define random variables as follows: R1 is equal to the rule ri (e.g., NP → D N). A, B, C are the labels for node i, the left child of node i, and the right child of node i respectively. (E.g., A = NP, B = D, C = N.) T1 is the inside tree rooted at node i. T2 is the inside tree rooted at the left child of node i, and T3 is the inside tree rooted at the right child of node i. O is the outside tree at node i. H1, H2, H3 are the hidden variables associated with node i, the left child of node i, and the right child of node i respectively. E is equal to 1 if node i is at the root of the tree (i.e., i = 1), 0 otherwise.","If the rule ri for the selected node i is of the form a → x, we have random variables R1, T1, H1, A1, O, E as defined above, but H2, H3, T2, T3, B, and C are not defined."]},{"title":"4 The Learning Algorithm for L-PCFGs","paragraphs":["Our goal is to design a learning algorithm for L-PCFGs. The input to the algorithm will be a training set consisting of skeletal trees, assumed to be sampled from some underlying L-PCFG. The output of the algorithm will be estimates for the π, t, and q parameters. The training set does not include values for the latent variables; this is the main challenge in learning.","This section focuses on an algorithm for recovery of the t parameters. A description of the algorithms for recovery of the π and q parameters is deferred until section 6.1 of this paper; these 1053 steps are straightforward once we have derived the method for the t parameters.","We describe an algorithm that correctly recovers the parameters of an L-PCFG as the size of the training set goes to infinity (this statement is made more precise in section 4.2). The algorithm relies on an assumption—the “pivot” assumption—that we now describe. 4.1 Features, and the Pivot Assumption We assume a function τ from inside trees to a finite set F , and a function ρ that maps outside trees to a finite set G. The function τ (t) (ρ(o)) can be thought of as a function that maps an inside tree t (outside tree o) to an underlying feature. As one example, the function τ (t) might return the context-free rule at the root of the inside tree t; in this case the set F would be equal to the set of all context-free rules in the grammar. As an-other example, the function ρ(o) might return the context-free rule at the foot of the outside tree o.","In the more general case, we might have K separate functions τ (k)","(t) for k = 1 . . . K mapping inside trees to K separate features, and similarly we might have multiple features for outside trees. Cohen et al. (2013) describe one such feature definition, where features track single context-free rules as well as larger fragments such as two or three-level sub-trees. For simplicity of presenta-tion we describe the case of single features τ (t) and ρ(o) for the majority of this paper. The extension to multiple features is straightforward, and is discussed in section 6.2; the flexibility allowed by multiple features is important, and we use multiple features in our experiments.","Given functions τ and ρ, we define additional random variables: F = τ (T1), F2 = τ (T2), F3 = τ (T3), and G = ρ(O).","We can now give the following assumption: Assumption 1 (The Pivot Assumption). Under the L-PCFG being learned, there exist values α > 0 and β > 0 such that for each non-terminal a, for each hidden state h ∈ [m], the following state-ments are true: 1) ∃f ∈ F such that P (F = f | H1 = h, A = a) > α and for all h′","̸= h, P (F = f | H1 = h′",", A = a) = 0; 2) ∃g ∈ G such that P (G = g | H1 = h, A = a) > β and for all h′","̸= h, P (G = g | H1 = h′",", A = a) = 0.","This assumption is very similar to the assumption made by Arora et al. (2012) in the context of learning topic models. It implies that for each (a, h) pair, there are inside and outside tree features—which following Arora et al. (2012) we refer to as pivot features—that occur only2","in the presence of latent-state value h. As in (Arora et al., 2012), the pivot features will give us consider-able leverage in learning of the model. 4.2 The Learning Algorithm Figure 1 shows the learning algorithm for L-PCFGs. The algorithm consists of the following steps:","Step 0: Calculate estimates p̂(a → b c | a), p̂(g, f2, f3 | a → b c) and p̂(f, g | a). These estimates are easily calculated using counts taken from the training examples.","Step 1: Calculate values r̂(f | h, a) and ŝ(g | h, a); these are estimates of p(f | h1, a) and p(g | h1, a) respectively. This step is achieved using a matrix decomposition algorithm, described in section 5 of this paper, on the matrix Q̂a","with entries [ Q̂a","]f,g = p̂(f, g | a).","Step 2: Use the EM algorithm to find t̂ values that maximize the objective function in Eq. 1 (see figure 1). Crucially, this is a convex optimization problem, and the EM algorithm will converge to the global maximum of this likelihood function.","Step 3: Rule estimates are calculated using an application of the laws of probability.","Before giving a theorem concerning correctness of the algorithm we introduce two assumptions: Assumption 2 (Strict Convexity). If we have the equalities ŝ(g | h1, a) = P (G = g | H1 = h1, A = a), r̂(f2 | h2, b) = P (F2 = f2 | H2 = h2, B = b) and r̂(f3 | h3, c) = P (F3 = f3 | H2 = h3, C = c), then the function in Eq. 1 (figure 1) is strictly concave.","The function in Eq. 1 is always concave; this assumption adds the restriction that the function must be strictly concave—that is, it has a unique global maximum—in the case that the r̂ and ŝ estimates are exact estimates. Assumption 3 (Infinite Data). After running Step 0 of the algorithm we have p̂(a → b c | a) = p(a → b c | a) p̂(g, f2, f3 | a → b c) = p(g, f2, f3 | a → b c) p̂(f, g | a) = p(f, g | a) where p(. . .) is the probability under the underlying L-PCFG.","2","The requirements P (F = f | H1 = h′",", A = a) = 0 and P (G = g | H1 = h′",", A = a) = 0 are almost certainly overly strict; in theory and practice these probabilities should be able to take small but strictly positive values. 1054 We use the term “infinite data” because under standard arguments, p̂(. . .) converges to p(. . .) as M goes to ∞. The theorem is then as follows: Theorem 1. Consider the algorithm in figure 1. Assume that assumptions 1-3 (the pivot, strong convexity, and infinite data assumptions) hold for the underlying L-PCFG. Then there is some permutation σ : [m] → [m] such that for all a → b c, h1, h2, h3, t̂(a → b c, h2, h3 | a → b c, h1) = t(a → b c, σ(h2), σ(h3) | a → b c, σ(h1)) where t̂ are the parameters in the output, and t are the parameters of the underlying L-PCFG.","This theorem states that under assumptions 1-3, the algorithm correctly learns the t parameters of an L-PCFG, up to a permutation over the latent states defined byσ. Given the assumptions we have made, it is not possible to do better than recovering the correct parameter values up to a permutation, due to symmetries in the model. As-suming that the π and q parameters are recovered in addition to the t parameters (see section 6.1), the resulting model will define exactly the same distribution over full trees as the underlying L-PCFG up to this permutation, and will define exactly the same distribution over skeletal trees, so in this sense the permutation is benign.","Proof of theorem 1: Under the assumptions of the theorem, Q̂a","f,g = p(f, g | a) =","∑","h p(h | a)p(f | h, a)p(g | h, a). Under the pivot assumption, and theorem 2 of section 5, step 1 (the matrix decomposition step) will therefore recover values r̂ and ŝ such that r̂(f | h, a) = p(f | σ(h), a) and ŝ(g | h, a) = p(g | σ(h), a) for some permutation σ : [m] → [m]. For simplicity, assume that σ(j) = j for all j ∈ [m] (the argument for other permutations involves a straightforward extension of the following argument). Under the assumptions of the theorem, p̂(g, f2, f3 | a → b c) = p(g, f2, f3 | a → b c), hence the function being optimized in Eq. 1 is equal to","∑ g,f2,f3 p(g, f2, f3 | a → b c) log κ(g, f2, f3) where κ(g, f2, f3) = ∑ h1,h2,h3 ( t̂(h1, h2, h3 | a → b c) ×p(g | h1, a)p(f2 | h2, b)p(f3 | h3, c)) Now consider the optimization problem in Eq. 1. By standard results for cross entropy, the maximum of the function ∑ g,f2,f3 p(g, f2, f3 | a → b c) log q(g, f2, f3 | a → b c) with respect to the q values is achieved at q(g, f2, f3 | a → b c) = p(g, f2, f3 | a → b c). In addition, under the assumptions of the L-PCFG, p(g, f2, f3 | a → b c) = ∑ h1,h2,h3 (p(h1, h2, h3 | a → b c) ×p(g | h1, a)p(f2 | h2, b)p(f3 | h3, c)) Hence the maximum of Eq. 1 is achieved at t̂(h1, h2, h3 | a → b c) = p(h1, h2, h3 | a → b c)","(2) because this gives κ(g, f2, f3) = p(g, f2, f3 | a → b c). Under the strict convexity assumption the maximum of Eq. 1 is unique, hence the t̂ values must satisfy Eq. 2. Finally, it follows from Eq. 2, and the equality p̂(a → b c | a) = p(a → b c | a), that Step 3 of the algorithm gives t̂(a → b c, h2, h3 | a, h1) = t(a → b c, h2, h3 | a, h1).","We can now see how the strict convexity assumption is needed. Without this assumption, there may be multiple settings for t̂ that achieve κ(g, f2, f3) = p(g, f2, f3 | a → b c); the values t̂(h1, h2, h3 | a → b c) = p(h1, h2, h3 | a → b c) will be included in this set of solutions, but other, inconsistent solutions will also be included.","As an extreme example of the failure of the strict convexity assumption, consider a feature-vector definition with |F | = |G| = 1. In this case the function in Eq. 1 reduces to log","∑ h1,h2,h3","t̂(h1, h2, h3 | a → b c). This function has a maximum value of 0, achieved at all values of t̂. Intuitively, this definition of inside and outside tree features loses all information about the latent states, and does not allow successful learning of the underlying L-PCFG. More generally, it is clear that the strict convexity assumption will depend directly on the choice of feature functions τ (t) and ρ(o). Remark: The infinite data assumption, and sample complexity. The infinite data assumption deserves more discussion. It is clearly a strong assumption that there is sufficient data for 1055 Input: A set of M skeletal trees sampled from some underlying L-PCFG. The count[. . .] function counts the number of times that event . . . occurs in the training sample. For example, count[A = a] is the number of times random variable A takes value a in the training sample. Step 0: Calculate the following estimates from the training samples: • p̂(a → b c | a) = count[R1 = a → b c]/count[A = a] • p̂(g, f2, f3 | a → b c) = count[G = g, F2 = f2, F3 = f3, R1 = a → b c]/count[R1 = a → b c] • p̂(f, g | a) = count[F = f, G = g, A = a]/count[A = a]","• ∀a ∈ I, define a matrix Q̂a ∈ Rd×d′","where d = |F| and d′ = |G| as [ Q̂a","]f,g = p̂(f, g | a).","Step 1: ∀a ∈ I, use the algorithm in figure 2 with input Q̂a to derive estimates r̂(f | h, a) and ŝ(g | h, a). Remark: These quantities are estimates of P (F1 = f | H1 = h, A = a) and P (G = g | H = h, A = a) respectively. Note that under the independence assumptions of the L-PCFG, P (F1 = f | H1 = h, A = a) = P (F2 = f | H2 = h, A2 = a) = P (F3 = f | H3 = h, A3 = a). Step 2: For each rule a → b c, findt̂(h1, h2, h3 | a → b c) values that maximize ∑","g,f 2,f","3 p̂(g, f2, f3 | a → b c) log ∑","h 1,h 2,h","3 t̂(h1, h2, h3 | a → b c)ŝ(g | h1, a)r̂(f2 | h2, b)r̂(f3 | h3, c) (1) under the constraints t̂(h1, h2, h3 | a → b c) ≥ 0, and","∑ h 1,h","2,h","3 t̂(h1, h2, h3 | a → b c) = 1. Remark: the function in Eq. 1 is concave in the values t̂ being optimized over. We use the EM algorithm, which converges to a global optimum. Step 3: ∀a → b c, h1, h2, h3, calculate rule parameters as follows: t̂(a → b c, h2, h3 | a, h1) = t̂(a → b c, h1, h2, h3 | a)/ ∑","b,c,h 2,h","3 t̂(a → b c, h1, h2, h3 | a) where t̂(a → b c, h1, h2, h3 | a) = p̂(a → b c | a) × t̂(h1, h2, h3 | a → b c).

A more detailed analysis of the algorithm would derive sample complexity results, giving guarantees on the sample size M required to reach a level of accuracy ε in the estimates, with probability at least 1 − δ, as a function of ε, δ, and other relevant quantities such as n, d, d′",", m, α, β and so on.","In spite of the strength of the infinite data assumption, we stress the importance of this result as a guarantee for the algorithm. First, a guarantee of correct parameter values in the limit of infinite data is typically the starting point for a sample complexity result (see for example (Hsu et al., 2009; Anandkumar et al., 2012)). Second, our sense is that a sample complexity result can be derived for our algorithm using standard methods: specifically, the analysis in (Arora et al., 2012) gives one set of guarantees; the remaining optimization problems we solve are convex maximum-likelihood problems, which are also relatively easy to analyze. Note that several pieces of previous work on spectral methods for latent-variable models focus on algorithms that are correct under the infinite data assumption."]},{"title":"5 The Matrix Decomposition Algorithm","paragraphs":["This section describes the matrix decomposition algorithm used in Step 1 of the learning algorithm. 5.1 Problem Setting Our goal will be to solve the following matrix decomposition problem: Matrix Decomposition Problem (MDP) 1.

Inputs: As in Matrix Decomposition Problem 1. Assumptions: As in Matrix Decomposition Problem 1. Algorithm: Step 1. Run the algorithm of section 5.2 on the matrix Q to derive estimates r̂(f | h) and π̂(h).

Find t̂(h′ | h) for all h, h′","∈ [m] that maximize ∑ f,g Qf,g log ∑ h,h′","r̂(h | f)t̂(h′ | h)ŝ(g | h′",") (3)","subject to t̂(h′","| h) ≥ 0, and ∀h, ∑","h′ t̂(h′","| h) = 1.","Remark: the function in Eq. 3 is concave in the t̂ parame-","ters. We use the EM algorithm to find a global optimum. Step 4. Return the following values:","• π̂(h) for all h, as an estimate of π(σ(h)) for some permutation σ.","• r̂(f | h) for all f, h as an estimate of r(f | σ(h)) for the same permutation σ. •","∑ h′ t̂(h′","| h)ŝ(g | h′",") as an estimate of s(f | σ(h))","for the same permutation σ. Figure 2: The algorithm for Matrix Decomposition Problem 1","Under these assumptions, the algorithm in figure 1 recovers estimates π̂(a, h) and q̂(a → x | a, h).

Note that p̂(h | a) can be derived from the matrix decomposition step when applied to Q̂a",", and p̂(a) is easily recovered from the training examples. 6.2 Extension to Include Multiple Features We now describe an extension to allow K separate functions τ (k)","(t) for k = 1 . . . K mapping inside trees to features, and L feature functions ρ(l)","(o) for l = 1 . . . L over outside trees.","The algorithm in figure 1 can be extended as follows. First, Step 1 of the algorithm (the matrix 1058 decomposition step) can be extended to provide estimates r̂(k)","(f (k)","| h, a) and ŝ(l)","(g(l)","| h, a). In brief, this involves running CCA on a matrix E[φ(T )(ψ(O))⊤","| A = a] where φ and ψ are inside and outside binary feature vectors derived directly from the inside and outside features, using a one-hot representation. CCA results in a lowdimensional representation that can be used in the steps described in section 5.2; the remainder of the algorithm is the same. In practice, the addition of multiple features may lead to better CCA representations.","Next, we modify the objective function in Eq. 1 to be the following: ∑ i,j,k ∑","gi ,fj 2 ,fk","3","p(gi",", f j","2 , f k","3 | a → b c) log κi,j,k","(gi",", f j","2 , f k","3 ) where","κi,j,k","(gi , f j","2 , f k","3 ) = ∑ h1,h2,h3 ( t̂(h1, h2, h3 | a → b c)","×ŝi (gi","| h","1, a)r̂j","(f j 2 | h2, b)r̂k","(f k","3 | h3, c)) Thus the new objective function consists of a sum of L×M 2","terms, each corresponding to a different combination of inside and outside features. The function remains concave. 6.3 Use as an Initializer for EM The learning algorithm for L-PCFGs can be used as an initializer for the EM algorithm for L-PCFGs. Two-step estimation methods such as these are well known in statistics; there are guarantees for example that if the first estimator is consistent, and the second step finds the closest local maxima of the likelihood function, then the resulting estimator is both consistent and efficient (in terms of number of samples required). See for example page 453 or Theorem 4.3 (page 454) of (Lehmann and Casella, 1998)."]},{"title":"7 Experiments on Parsing","paragraphs":["This section describes parsing experiments using the learning algorithm for L-PCFGs.

With EM and Pivot+EM, the number of iterations for EM to reach convergence is given below the perplexity. The best result for each column (for each m value) is in bold. The “test” column gives perplexity results on the test set. Each perplexity calculation on the test set is done using the best model on the development set. bi-KN+int and tri-KN+int are bigram and trigram Kneser-Ney interpolated models (Kneser and Ney, 1995), using the SRILM toolkit. s(w2 | h) are parameters of the approach. The conventional approach to estimation of the parameters r(h | w1) and s(w2 | h) from a corpus is to use the EM algorithm. In this section we compare the EM algorithm to a pivot-based method. It is straightforward to represent this model as an L-PCFG, and hence to use our implementation for estimation.","In this special case, the L-PCFG learning algorithm is equivalent to a simple algorithm, with the following steps: 1) define the matrix Q with entries Qw1,w2 = count(w1, w2)/N where count(w1, w2) is the number of times that bigram (w1, w2) is seen in the data, and N =∑","w1,w2 count(w1, w2).

First, because in this case the L-PCFG algorithm reduces to a simple algorithm, it allows us to evaluate the core ideas in the method very directly. Second, it allows us to test the pivot method on the very large datasets that are available for language modeling.","We use two corpora for our experiments. The first is the Brown corpus, as used by Bengio et al. (2006) in language modeling experiments. Following Bengio et al. (2006), we use the first 800K words for training (and replace all words that appear once with an UNK token), the next 200K words for development, and the remaining data (165,171 tokens) as a test set. The size of the vocabulary is 24,488 words. The second corpus we use is the New York Times portion of the Gigaword corpus. Here, the training set consists of 1.31 billion tokens. We use 159 million tokens for development set and 156 million tokens for test. All words that appeared less than 20 times in the training set were replaced with the UNK token. The size of the vocabulary is 235,223 words. Unknown words in test data are ignored when calculating perplexity (this is the standard set-up in the SRILM toolkit).","In our experiments we use the first half of each development set to optimize the number of iterations of the EM or Pivot+EM algorithms. As be-fore, Pivot+EM uses 1 or more EM steps with parameter initialization from the Pivot method.","Table 2 gives perplexity results for the different algorithms. As in the parsing experiments, the Pivot method alone performs worse than EM, but the Pivot+EM method gives results that are competitive with EM. The Pivot+EM method requires fewer iterations of EM than the EM algorithm. On the Brown corpus the difference is quite dramatic, with only 1 or 2 iterations required, as opposed to 10 or more for EM. For the NYT corpus the Pivot+EM method requires more iterations (around 10 or 20), but still requires significantly fewer iterations than the EM algorithm.","On the Gigaword corpus, with m = 256, EM takes 12h57m (32 iterations at 24m18s per itera-tion) compared to 1h50m for the Pivot method. On Brown, EM takes 1m47s (8 iterations) compared to 5m44s for the Pivot method. Both the EM and pivot algorithm implementations were highly optimized, and written in Matlab. Results at other values of m are similar. From these results the Pivot method appears to become more competitive speed-wise as the data size increases (the Gigaword corpus is more than 1,300 times larger than the Brown corpus)."]},{"title":"9 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have described a new algorithm for parameter estimation in L-PCFGs.
