With its aim to identify and classify the semantic relationship between two entities (ACE 2002-2007), relation extraction is of great significance to many NLP applications, such as question answering, information fusion, social network construction, and knowledge mining and population etc. * Corresponding author","In the literature, the mainstream research on relation extraction adopts statistical machine learning methods, which can be grouped into supervised learning (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Soresen, 2004; Zhou et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006; Qian et al., 2008; Chan and Roth, 2011), semi-supervised learning (Zhang et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2008; Qian et al., 2010) and unsupervised learning (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005) in terms of the amount of labeled training data they need. Usually the extraction performance depends heavily on the quality and quantity of the labeled data, however, the manual annotation of a large-scale corpus is labor-intensive and timeconsuming. In the last decade researchers have turned to another effective learning paradigm-- active learning (AL), which, given a small number of labeled instances and a large number of unlabeled instances, selects the most informative unlabeled instances to be manually annotated and add them into the training data in an iterative fashion. Essentially active learning attempts to decrease the quantity of labeled instances by enhancing their quality, gauged by their informativeness to the learner. Since its emergence, active learning has been successfully applied to many tasks in NLP (Engelson and Dagan, 1996; Hwa, 2004; Tomanek et al., 2007; Settles and Craven, 2008).","It is trivial to validate, as we will do later in this paper, that active learning can also alleviate the annotation burden for relation extraction in one language while retaining the extraction performance. However, there are cases when we may exploit relation extraction in multiple languages and there are corpora with relation instances annotated for more than one language, such as the ACE RDC 2005 English and Chinese corpora. Hu et al. (2013) shows that supervised relation extraction in one language (e.g. Chinese) 582 can be enhanced by relation instances translated from another language (e.g. English). This demonstrates that there is some complementariness between relation instances in two languages, particularly when the training data is scarce. One natural question is: Can this characteristic be made full use of so that active learning can maximally benefit relation extraction in two languages? To the best of our knowledge, so far the issue of joint active learning in two languages has yet been addressed. Moreover, the success of joint bilingual learning may lend itself to many inherent multilingual NLP tasks such as POS tagging (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001), name entity recognition (Yarowsky et al., 2001), sentiment analysis (Wan, 2009), and semantic role labeling (Sebastian and Lapata, 2009) etc.","This paper proposes a bilingual active learning (BAL) paradigm to relation classification with a small number of labeled relation instances and a large number of unlabeled instances in two languages (non-parallel). Instead of using a parallel corpus which should have entity/relation alignment information and is thus difficult to obtain, this paper employs an off-the-shelf machine translator to translate both labeled and unlabeled instances from one language into the other language, forming pseudo parallel corpora. These translated instances along with the original instances are then fed into a bilingual active learning engine. Findings obtained from experiments with relation classification on the ACE 2005 corpora show that this kind of pseudo-parallel corpora can significantly improve the classification performance for both languages in a BAL framework.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the previous work on relation extraction while Section 3 describes our baseline systems. Section 4 elaborates on the bilingual active learning paradigm and Section 5 discusses the experimental results. Finally conclusions and directions for future work are presented in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["While there are many studies in monolingual relation extraction, there are only a few on multilingual relation extraction in the literature.","Monolingual relation extraction: A wide range of studies on relation extraction focus on monolingual resources. As far as representation of relation instances is concerned, there are feature-based methods (Zhao et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2005; Chan and Roth, 2011) and kernel-based methods (Zelenko et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2006; Qian et al., 2008), mainly for the English language. Both methods are also widely used in relation extraction in other languages, such as those in Chinese relation extraction (Che et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2010).","Multilingual relation extraction: There are only two studies related to multilingual relation extraction. Kim et al. (2010) propose a cross-lingual annotation projection approach which uses parallel corpora to acquire a relation detector on the target language. However, the mapping of two entities involved in a relation instance may leads to errors. Therefore, Kim and Lee (2012) further employ a graph-based semi-supervised learning method, namely Label Propagation (LP), to indirectly propagate labels from the source language to the target language in an iterative fashion. Both studies transfer relation annotations via parallel corpora from the resource-rich language (English) to the resourcepoor language (Korean), but not vice versa. Based on a small number of labeled instances and a large number of unlabeled instances in both languages, our method differs from theirs in that we adopt a bilingual active learning paradigm via machine translation and improve the performance for both languages simultaneously.","Active Learning in NLP: Active learning has become an active research topic due to its potential to significantly reduce the amount of labeled training data while achieving comparable performance with supervised learning. It has been successfully applied to many NLP applications, such as POS tagging (Engelson and Dagan, 1996; Ringger et al., 2007), word sense disambiguation (Chan and Ng, 2007; Zhu and Hovy, 2007), sentiment detection (Brew et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012), syntactical parsing (Hwa, 2004; Osborne and Baldridge, 2004), and named entity recognition (Shen et al., 2004; Tomanek et al., 2007; Tomanek and Hahn, 2009) etc.","Different from these AL studies on a single task, Reichart et al. (2008) introduce a multi-task active learning (MTAL) paradigm, where unlabeled instances are selected for two annotation tasks (i.e. named entity and syntactic parse tree). They demonstrate that MTAL in the same language outperforms one-sided and random selection AL. From a different perspective, we propose an active learning framework for the same task, but across two different languages.","Another related study (Haffari and Sarkar, 2009) deals with active learning for multilingual 583 machine translation, which make use of multilingual corpora to decrease human annotation efforts by selecting highly informative sentences for a newly added language in multilingual parallel corpora. While machine translation inherently deals with multilingual parallel corpora, our task focuses on relation extraction by pseudo parallel corpora in two languages."]},{"title":"3 Baseline Systems","paragraphs":["This section first introduces the fundamental supervised learning method, and then describes a baseline active learning algorithm. 3.1 Supervised Learning","We adopt the feature-based method for funda-","mental supervised relation classification, rather","than the tree kernel-based method, since active","learning needs a large number of iterations and","the kernel-based method usually performs much","slower than the feature-based one.

During iterations a batch of unlabeled instances are chosen in terms of their informativeness to the current classifier, labeled by an oracle and in turn added into the labeled data to retrain the classifier. Due to our focus on the effectiveness of bilingual active learning on relation classification, we only use uncertainty sampling without incorporating more complex measures, such as diversity and representativeness (Settles and Craven, 2008), and leave them for future work.

Pool-based active learning with uncertainty sampling","Since the SVMLIB package used in this paper can output probabilities assigned to the class labels on an instance, we have three uncertainty metrics readily available, i.e., least confidence (LC), margin (M) and entropy (E). The NER experimental results on multiple corpora (Settles and Craven, 2008) show that there is no single clear winner among these three metrics. This conclusion is also validated by our preliminary experiments on the task of active learning relation extraction, thus we adopt the LC metric for simplicity. Specifically, with a sequence of K probabilities for a relation instance at some iteration, denoted as {p1,p2,...pK} in the descending order, the LC metric of the relation instance can be simply picked as the first one, i.e.","1pH LC","= (1)","Where K denotes the total number of relation classes. Note that this metric actually reflects prediction reliability (i.e. reverse uncertainty) rather than uncertainty in order to facilitate joint 584 confidence calculation for two languages (cf. §4.4).

Suppose we have a small number of labeled instances in both languages, denoted as Lc and Le (non-parallel) respectively, and a large number of unlabeled instances in both languages, denoted as Uc and Ue (non-parallel). The test instances in both languages are represented as Tc and Te. In order to take full advantage of bilingual resources, we translate both labeled and unlabeled instances in one language to ones in the other language as follows: Lc ̆Let Uc ̆Uet Le ̆Lct Ue ̆Lct","The objective is to learn SVM classifiers in both languages, denoted as SVMc and SVMe respectively, in a BAL fashion to improve their classification performance. 4.2 Bilingual Active Learning Framework Currently, AL is widely used in NLP tasks in a single language, i.e., during iterations unlabeled instances least confident only in one language are picked and manually labeled to augment the training data. The only exception is AL for machine translation (Haffari et al., 2009; Haffari and Sarkar, 2009), whose purpose is to select the most informative sentences in the source language to be manually translated into the target language. Previous studies (Reichart et al., 2008; Haffari and Sarkar, 2009) show that multi-task active learning (MTAL) can yield promising overall results, no matter whether they are two different tasks or the task of machine translation on multiple language pairs. If a specific NLP task on two languages, such as relation classification, can be regarded as two tasks, it is reasonable to argue that these two tasks can benefit each other when jointly performed in the BAL framework. Yet, to our knowledge, this issue remains unexplored.","An important issue for bilingual learning is how to obtain two language views for relation instances from multilingual resources. There are three solutions to this problem, i.e. parallel corpora (Lu et al., 2011), translated corpora (aka. pseudo parallel corpora) (Wan 2009), and bilingual lexicons (Oh et al., 2009). We adopt the one with pseudo parallel corpora, using the machine translation method to generate instances from one language to the other in the BAL paradigm, as depicted in Fig. 2.

Framework of bilingual active learning In order to make full use of pseudo parallel","corpora, translated labeled and unlabeled in-","stances are augmented in the following two ways:","z For labeled Chinese instances (Lc) and English instances (Le), their translated counterparts (Let and Lct), along with their labels, are directly added into the labeled instances in the other language;","z For unlabeled Chinese instances (Uc) and English instances (Ue), during an active learning iteration the top n unlabeled instances in Uc and Uet which are least confidently jointly 585 predicted by SVMc and SVMe are labeled by an oracle and added to Lc and Le respectively. (cf. §4.4) 4.3 Instance Projection via MT Among the several off-the-shelf machine translation services, we select the Google Translator1"," because of its high quality and easy accessibility. Both the mentions of relation instances and the mentions of two involved entities are first translated into the other language via machine translation. Then, two entities in the original instance are aligned with their counterparts in the translated instance in order to form an aligned bilingual relation instance pair. Instance translation All the positive instances in the ACE 2005 Chinese and English corpora are translated to another language respectively, i.e. Chinese to English and vice versa. The relation instance is represented as the word sequence between two entities. This word sequence, rather than the whole sentence, is then translated to another language by the Google Translator. The reason is that, al-though this sequence loses partial contextual information of the relation instance, its translation quality is supposed to be better. Our preliminary experiments indicate that the addition of contextual information fail to benefit the task. After translation, word segmentation is performed on Chinese instances translated from English while tokenization is needed for translated English instances. Entity alignment The objective of entity alignment is to build a mapping from the entities in the original instances to the entities in the translated instances. Put in another way, entity alignment automatically marks the entity mentions in the translated instance, thereby the feature vector correspond-ing to the translated instance can be constructed. Entity alignment is vital in cross-language relation extraction whose difficulty lies in the fact that the same entity mention as an isolated phrase and as an integral phrase in the relation instance can be translated to different phrases. For example, the Chinese entity mention “官员” (officer) is translated to “officer” in isolation, it is, however, translated to “officials” when in the relation instance “叙利亚 官员” (Syrian officials). 1 http://translate.google.com","Input: - Me, entity mention in English - Re, relation instance in English - Mct, translation of Me in Chinese - Rc, translation of Re in Chinese - L, a lexicon consisting of entries like (ei, ci, pi),","where pi is the translation probability from ei to ci - α, probability threshold","Output: - Mc, the counterpart of Me in Rc","Steps: 1. If Mct can be exactly found in Rc, then return","Mct 2. If the rightmost part of Mct can be found in Rc,","then this part can be returned 3. For very word we in Me,","a) If there exists a word wc in Rc and (we, wc, p)","in L and p>α, then (we, wc) is a match of two words","b) Return a successive sequence of matching","words wc 4. Return null Algorithm entity alignment Figure 3. Entity alignment algorithm","Therefore, we devise some heuristics to align entity mentions between Chinese and English. The basic idea is that the word sequence in one mention successively matches the word sequence in the other mention. Take entity alignment from English to Chinese as an example, given entity mention Me in relation instance Re in English and their respective translations Mct and Rc in Chinese, the objective of entity alignment is to find Mc, the counterpart of Me in Rc. The procedure of entity alignment algorithm can be described in Fig. 3.","In the algorithm, the probability threshold α is empirically set to 0.002 where the precision and recall of entity alignment are balanced. Our lexicon is derived from the FBIS parallel corpus (#LDC2003E14), which is widely used in machine translation between English and Chinese. It should be noted that the process of relation translation and entity alignment are far from perfec-tion, leading to reduction in the number of instances being mapping to the other language, i.e.","|Lc| > |Let|","|Uc| > |Uet|","|Le| > |Lct|","|Ue| > |Lct| 4.4 Bilingual Active Learning Algorithm The basic idea of our BAL paradigm is that, while unlabeled instances uncertain in one lan-586 guage are informative to the learner in that language, unlabeled instances jointly uncertain in both languages are informative to the learners in both languages, thus potentially improving classification performance for both languages more than their individual active learners do. This idea is embodied in the BAL algorithm in Fig. 4, where n is the batch size, i.e., the number of instances selected, labeled and augmented at each iteration. Figure 4. Bilingual active learning algorithm","The key point of this algorithm lies in Step 5 and Step 6, where unlabeled instances from Uc and Ue are selected and labeled respectively. Take Chinese for an example, when gauging the prediction uncertainty for an unlabeled instance in Uc, not only its own uncertainty measure Hc predicted by SVMc is considered, but also the uncertainty measure Het for its translation counterpart in Uet, which is predicted by SVMe, is considered. Generally, in order to jointly consider these two measures, there are three methods to compute their means, namely, arithmetic mean, geometric mean and harmonic mean. Preliminary experiments show that among these three means, there is no single winner, so we simply take the geometric mean defined as follows: etcg HHH *= (2)","Considering that we adopt the LC measure as the uncertainty score, when an instance in Uc can’t find its translation counterpart in Uet due to translation error or entity alignment failure, Het is set to 1, i.e. the maximum. Since the bigger H is, the more confident the prediction is, the less likely the instance will be chosen, in this way we discourage the unlabeled instances without translation counterparts."]},{"title":"5 Experimentation","paragraphs":["We have systematically evaluated our BAL paradigm on the relation classification task using ACE RDC 2005 RDC Chinese and English corpora. 5.1 Experimental Settings Corpora and Preprocessing We use the ACE 2005 RDC Chinese and English corpora as the benchmark data (hereafter we refer to them as the Chinese corpus (ACE2005c) and the English corpus (ACE2005e) respectively). Both corpora have the same entity/relation hierarchies, which define 7 entity types, 6 major relation types. However, the Chinese corpus contains 633 documents and 9,147 positive relation instances while the English corpus only contains 498 files and 6,253 positive instances. Therefore, in order to balance the corpus scale to fairly evaluate bilingual active learning impact on relation classification, we randomly select 458 Chinese files and thus get 6,268 positive instances, comparable to the English corpus.","Preprocessing steps for both corpora include sentence splitting and tokenization (word segmentation for Chinese using ICTCLAS2",").

The training parameters C (SVM) is set to 2.4 according to our previous work on relation extraction (Qian et al., 2010). Relation classification performance is evaluated using the standard Precision (P), Recall (R) and their harmonic average (F1) as well as deficiency measure (cf. latter in this section.). Overall performance scores are averaged over 10 runs. For each run, 1/40 and 1/5 randomly selected instances are used as the training and test set respectively while the remaining instances are used as the unlabeled set for further labeling during active learning iterations. Methods for Comparison For fair comparison, two baseline methods of supervised learning are included to augment their training sets with labeled instances during iterations. However, these labeled instances are chosen randomly from the corpus.","SL-MO (Supervised Learning with monolingual labeled instances): only the monolingual labeled instances are fed to the SVM classifiers for both Chinese and English relation classification respectively. The initial training data only contain Lc and Le for Chinese and English respectively.","SL-CR (Supervised Learning with cross-lingual labeled instances): in addition to monolingual labeled instances (SL-MO), the training data for supervised learning contain labeled instances translated from the other language. That is, the initial training data contain Lc and Lct for Chinese, or Le and Let for English. More important, at each iteration not only the labeled instances are added to the training data of its own language, but their translated instances are also added to the training data of the other language.","AL-MO (Active Learning with monolingual instances): labeled and unlabeled data for active learning only contain monolingual instances. No translated instances are involved. That is, the data contain Lc and Uc for Chinese, or Le and Ue for English respectively. This is the normal active learning method applied to a single language.","AL-CR (Active Learning with cross-lingual instances): both the manually labeled instances and their translated ones are added to the respective training data.

Their translated instances in Uet and Uct are also added to the English/Chinese training data respectively.","AL-BI (Active Learning with bilingual labeled and unlabeled instances): similar to AL-CR with the exception that the unlabeled instances are chosen not by uncertainty scores in one language, but by the joint uncertainty scores in two languages.

Experiments with the task of relation classification on the ACE RDC 2005 Chinese and English corpora show that bilingual active learning can significantly outperforms monolingual active learning for both Chinese and English simultaneously. Moreover, we demonstrate that BAL across two languages can compete against monolingual AL when the annotation scale is limited, though the overall number of labeled instances remains the same.","For future work, on one hand, we plan to combine uncertainty sampling with diversity and informativeness measures; on the other hand, we intend to combine BAL with semi-supervised learning to further reduce human annotation efforts."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This research is supported by Grants 61373096, 61305088, 61273320, and 61331011 under the National Natural Science Foundation of China; Project 2012AA011102 under the “863” National High-Tech Research and Development of China; Grant 11KJA520003 under the Education Bureau of Jiangsu, China.
