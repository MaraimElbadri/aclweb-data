For example, sentence (1) could be interpreted as it is not the case that he stopped. (1) He didn't stop.","Negation expressions are common in natural language text. According to the statistics on biomedical literature genre (Vincze et al., 2008), 19.44% of sentences contain negative expressions. The percentage rises to 22.5% on Conan Doyle stories (Morante and Daelemans, 2012). It is interesting that a negative sentence may have both negative and positive meanings. For example, sentence (2) could be interpreted as He stopped, but not until he got to Jackson Hole with positive part he stopped and negative part until he got to Jackson Hole. Moreover, a nega- * Corresponding author tive expression normally interacts with some special part in the sentence, referred as negation focus in linguistics. Formally, negation focus is defined as the special part in the sentence, which is most prominently or explicitly negated by a negative expression. Hereafter, we denote negative expression in boldface and negation focus underlined. (2) He didn't stop until he got to Jackson Hole.","While people tend to employ stress or intonation in speech to emphasize negation focus and thus it is easy to identify negation focus in speech corpora, such stress or intonation information often misses in the dominating text corpora. This poses serious challenges on negation focus identification. Current studies (e.g., Blanco and Moldovan, 2011; Rosenberg and Bergler, 2012) sort to various kinds of intra-sentence information, such as lexical features, syntactic features, semantic role features and so on, ignoring less-obvious inter-sentence information. This largely defers the performance of negation focus identification and its wide applications, since such contextual discourse information plays a critical role on negation focus identification. Take following sentence as an example.","(3) Helen didn’t allow her youngest son to play the violin.","In sentence (3), there are several scenarios on identification of negation focus, with regard to negation expression n’t, given different contexts: Scenario A: Given sentence But her husband did as next sentence, the negation focus should be Helen, yielding interpretation the person who didn’t allow the youngest son to play the violin is Helen but not her husband. Scenario B: Given sentence She thought that he didn’t have the artistic talent like her eldest son as next sentence, the negation focus should be the youngest son, yielding interpretation Helen 522 thought that her eldest son had the talent to play the violin, but the youngest son didn’t. Scenario C: Given sentence Because of her neighbors’ protests as previous sentence, the negation focus should be play the violin, yielding interpretation Helen didn’t allow her youngest son to play the violin, but it didn’t show whether he was allowed to do other things.","In this paper, to well accommodate such contextual discourse information in negation focus identification, we propose a graph model to enrich normal intra-sentence features with various kinds of inter-sentence features from both lexical and topic perspectives. Besides, the standard PageRank algorithm is employed to optimize the graph model. Evaluation on the *SEM 2012 shared task corpus (Morante and Blanco, 2012) justifies our approach over several strong baselines.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 overviews the related work. Section 3 presents several strong baselines on negation focus identification with only intra-sentence features. Section 4 introduces our topic-driven word-based graph model with contextual discourse information. Section 5 reports the experimental results and analysis. Finally, we conclude our work in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Earlier studies of negation were almost in linguistics (e.g. Horn, 1989; van der Wouden, 1997), and there were only a few in natural language processing with focus on negation recognition in the biomedical domain. For example, Chapman et al. (2001) developed a rule-based negation recognition system, NegEx, to determine whether a finding mentioned within narra-tive medical reports is present or absent. Since the release of the BioScope corpus (Vincze et al., 2008), a freely available resource consisting of medical and biological texts, machine learning approaches begin to dominate the research on negation recognition (e.g. Morante et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010).","Generally, negation recognition includes three subtasks: cue detection, which detects and identifies possible negative expressions in a sentence, scope resolution, which determines the grammatical scope in a sentence affected by a negative expression, and focus identification, which identifies the constituent in a sentence most prominently or explicitly negated by a negative expression. This paper concentrates on the third subtask, negation focus identification.","Due to the increasing demand on deep understanding of natural language text, negation recognition has been drawing more and more attention in recent years, with a series of shared tasks and workshops, however, with focus on cue detection and scope resolution, such as the BioNLP 2009 shared task for negative event detection (Kim et al., 2009) and the ACL 2010 Workshop for scope resolution of negation and speculation (Morante and Sporleder, 2010), followed by a special issue of Computational Linguistics (Morante and Sporleder, 2012) for modality and negation.","The research on negation focus identification was pioneered by Blanco and Moldovan (2011), who investigated the negation phenomenon in semantic relations and proposed a supervised learning approach to identify the focus of a negation expression. However, although Morante and Blanco (2012) proposed negation focus identification as one of the *SEM’2012 shared tasks, only one team (Rosenberg and Bergler, 2012) 1"," participated in this task. They identified negation focus using three kinds of heuristics and achieved 58.40 in F1-measure. This indicates great expectation in negation focus identification.","The key problem in current research on negation focus identification is its focus on intra-sentence information and large ignorance of in-ter-sentence information, which plays a critical role in the success of negation focus identification. For example, Ding (2011) made a qualita-tive analysis on implied negations in conversa-tion and attempted to determine whether a sentence was negated by context information, from the linguistic perspective. Moreover, a negation focus is always associated with authors’ intention in article. This indicates the great challenges in negation focus identification."]},{"title":"3 Baselines","paragraphs":["Negation focus identification in *SEM’2012 shared tasks is restricted to verbal negations annotated with MNEG in PropBank, with only the constituent belonging to a semantic role selected as negation focus.

Section 1 illustrates the necessity of such contextual discourse information in negation focus identification by giving three scenarios of different discourse contexts for negation expression n’t in sentence (3).","For better illustration of the importance of contextual discourse information, Table 1 shows the statistics of intra- and inter-sentence information necessary for manual negation focus identification with 100 instances randomly extracted from the held-out dataset of *SEM'2012 shared task corpus. It shows that only 17 instances can be identified by intra-sentence information. It is surprising that inter-sentence information is indispensable in 77 instances, among which 42 instances need only inter-sentence information and 35 instances need both intra- and inter-sentence information. This indicates the great importance of contextual discourse information on negation focus identification. It is also interesting to note 6 instances are hard to determine even given both intra- and inter-sentence information.","Info Number #Intra-Sentence Only 17 #Inter-Sentence Only 42","#Both 35","#Hard to Identify 6","(Note: \"Hard to Identify\" means that it is hard for a","human being to identify the negation focus even","given both intra- and inter-sentence information.) Table 1. Statistics of intra- and inter-sentence information on negation focus identification.","Statistically, we find that negation focus is always related with what authors repeatedly states in discourse context. This explains why contextual discourse information could help identify negation focus. While inter-sentence information provides the global characteristics from the discourse context perspective and intra-sentence information provides the local features from lexical, syntactic and semantic perspectives, both have their own contributions on negation focus identification.","In this paper, we first propose a graph model to gauge the importance of contextual discourse 524 information. Then, we incorporate both intra-and inter-sentence features into a machine learning-based framework for negation focus identification."]},{"title":"4.1 Graph Model","paragraphs":["Graph models have been proven successful in many NLP applications, especially in representing the link relationships between words or sentences (Wan and Yang, 2008; Li et al., 2009). Generally, such models could construct a graph to compute the relevance between document theme and words.","In this paper, we propose a graph model to represent the contextual discourse information from both lexical and topic perspectives. In particular, a word-based graph model is proposed to represent the explicit relatedness among words in a discourse from the lexical perspective, while a topic-driven word-based model is proposed to enrich the implicit relatedness between words, by adding one more layer to the word-based graph model in representing the global topic distribu-tion of the whole dataset. Besides, the PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1998) is adopted to optimize the graph model. Word-based Graph Model: A word-based graph model can be defined as Gword (W, E), where W={wi} is the set of words in one document and E={eij|wi, wj ∈W} is the set of directed edges between these words, as shown in Figure 1.  Figure 1. Word-based graph model.","In the word-based graph model, word node wi is weighted to represent the correlation of the word with authors’ intention. Since such correlation is more from the semantic perspective than the grammatical perspective, only content words are considered in our graph model, ignoring functional words (e.g., the, to,...). Especially, the content words limited to those with part-of-speech tags of JJ, NN, PRP, and VB. For simplicity, the weight of word node wi is initialized to 1.","In addition, directed edge eij is weighted to represent the relatedness between word wi and word wj in a document with transition probability P(j|i) from i to j, which is normalized as follows: | , ∑ , (1) where k represents the nodes in discourse, and Sim(wi,wj) denotes the similarity between wi and wj. In this paper, two kinds of information are used to calculate the similarity between words. One is word co-occurrence (if word wi and word wj occur in the same sentence or in the adjacent sentences, Sim(wi,wj) increases 1), and the other is WordNet (Miller, 1995) based similarity. Please note that Sim(wi,wi) = 0 to avoid self-transition, and Sim(wi,wj) and Sim(wj,wi) may not be equal.","Finally, the weights of word nodes are calculated using the PageRank algorithm as follows: ","1 ","∑","| 1 (2) where d is the damping factor as in the PageRank algorithm. Topic-driven Word-based Graph Model While the above word-based graph model can well capture the relatedness between content words, it can only partially model the focus of a negation expression since negation focus is more directly related with topic than content. In order to reduce the gap, we propose a topic-driven word-based model by adding one more layer to refine the word-based graph model over the global topic distribution, as shown in Figure 2."," Figure 2. Topic-driven word-based graph model. 525","Here, the topics are extracted from all the documents in the *SEM 2012 shared task using the LDA Gibbs Sampling algorithm (Griffiths, 2002). In the topic-driven word-based graph model, the first layer denotes the relatedness among content words as captured in the above word-based graph model, and the second layer denotes the topic distribution, with the dashed lines between these two layers indicating the word-topic model return by LDA.","Formally, the topic-driven word-based two-layer graph is defined as Gtopic (W, T, Ew, Et), where W={wi} is the set of words in one document and T={ti} is the set of topics in all documents; Ew={ewij|wi, wj ∈W} is the set of directed edges between words and Et ={etij|wi∈W, tj ∈T} is the set of undirected edges between words and topics; transition probability Pw(j|i) of ewij is defined as the same as P(j|i) of the word-based graph model. Besides, transition probability Pt (i,m) of etij in the word-topic model is defined as: , , ∑ , (3) where Rel(wi, tm) is the weight of word wi in topic tm calculated by the LDA Gibbs Sampling algorithm. On the basis, the transition probability Pw (j|i) of ewij is updated by calculating as following: ′| θ∙| 1θ∙ ,, ∑ ,,  (4) where k represents all topics linked to both word wi and word wj, and θ∈[0,1] is the coefficient controlling the relative contributions from the lexical information in current document and the topic information in all documents.","Finally, the weights of word nodes are calculated using the PageRank algorithm as follows: ","1 ","∑","′| 1 (5) where d is the damping factor as in the PageRank algorithm."]},{"title":"4.2 Negation Focus Identification via Graph Model","paragraphs":["Given the graph models and the PageRank optimization algorithm discussed above, four kinds of contextual discourse information are extracted as inter-sentence features (Table 2).","In particular, the total weight and the max","weight of words in the focus candidate are calcu-","lated as follows: ∑","(6) max","(7) where i represents the content words in the focus candidate.

As a freely downloadable resource, the *SEM shared task corpus is annotated on top of PropBank, which uses the WSJ section of the Penn TreeBank. In particular, negation focus annotation on this corpus is restricted to verbal negations (with corresponding mark 2 http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/sem2012-st-neg/ 526 MNEG in PropBank). On 50% of the corpus annotated by two annotators, the inter-annotator agreement was 0.72 (Blanco and Moldovan, 2011). Along with negation focus annotation, this corpus also contains other annotations, such as POS tag, named entity, chunk, constituent tree, dependency tree, and semantic role.","In total, this corpus provides 3,544 instances of negation focus annotations. For fair comparison, we adopt the same partition as *SEM’2012 shared task in all our experiments, i.e., with 2,302 for training, 530 for development, and 712 for testing.

Evaluation Metrics Same as the *SEM'2012 shared task, the evalua-tion is made using precision, recall, and F1-score. Especially, a true positive (TP) requires an exact match for the negation focus, a false positive (FP) occurs when a system predicts a non-existing negation focus, and a false negative (FN) occurs when the gold annotations specify a negation focus but the system makes no prediction.

If there lacks relevant information in a discourse context, negation focus will become difficult to be identified only by inter-sentence features.","Error analysis also shows that some of the negation focuses are very difficult to be identified, even for a human being. Consider the sentence (3) in Section 1, if given sentence because of her neighbors' protests, but her husband doesn’t think so as its following context, both Helen and to play the violin can become the negation focus.
