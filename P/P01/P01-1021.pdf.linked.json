Alexander Dikovsky Université de Nantes, IRIN, 2, rue de la Houssinière BP 92208 F 44322 Nantes cedex 3 France Alexandre.Dikovsky@irin.univ-nantes.fr Abstract","paragraphs":["Polarized dependency (PD-) grammars are proposed as a means of efficient treatment of discontinuous constructions. PD-grammars describe two kinds of dependencies : local, explicitly derived by the rules, and long, implicitly specified by negative and positive valencies of words. If in a PD-grammar the number of non-saturated valencies in derived structures is bounded by a constant, then it is weakly equivalent to a cf-grammar and has a ","- time parsing algorithm. It happens that such bounded PD-grammars are strong enough to express such phenomena as unbounded raising, extraction and extraposition."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Syntactic theories based on the concept of dependency have a long tradition. Tesnière (Tesnière, 1959) was the first who systematically described the sentence structure in terms of binary relations between words (dependencies), which form a dependency tree (D-tree for short). D-tree itself does not presume a linear order on words. However, any its surface realization projects some linear order relation (called also precedence). Some properties of surface syntactic structure can be expressed only in terms of both dependency (or its transitive closure called dominance) and precedence. One of such properties, projectivity, requires that any word occurring between a word ","and a word","dependent on","be dominated by ","In first dependency grammars (Gaifman, 1961) and in some more recent proposals: link grammars (Sleator and Temperly, 1993), projective dependency grammars (Lombardo and Lesmo, 1996) the projectivity is implied by definition. In some other theories, e.g. in word grammar (Hudson, 1984), it is used as one of the axioms defining acceptable surface structures. In presence of this property, D-trees are in a sense equivalent to phrase structures with head selection 1",". It is for this reason that D-trees determined by grammars of Robinson (Robinson, 1970), categorial grammars (Bar-Hillel et al., 1960), classi-cal Lambek calculus (Lambek, 1958), and some other formalisms are projective. Projectivity affects the complexity of parsing : as a rule, it allows dynamic programming technics which lead to polynomial time algorithms (cf.","  ","-time algorithm for link grammars in (Sleator and Temperly, 1993)). Meanwhile, the projectivity is not the norm in natural languages. For example, in most European languages there are such regular non-projective constructions as WH- or relative clause extraction, topicalization, comparative constructions, and some constructions specific to a language, e.g. French pronominal clitics or left dislocation. In terms of phrase structure, non-projectivity corresponds to discontinuity. In this form it is in the center of discussions till 70-ies. There are various dependency based approaches to this problem. In the framework of Meaning-Text Theory (Mel’čuk and Pertsov, 1987), dependencies between (some-1 See (Dikovsky and Modina, 2000) for more details. times non adjacent) words are determined in terms of their local neighborhood, which leads to non-tractable parsing (the NP-hardness argument of (Neuhaus and Bröker, 1997) applies to them). More recent versions of dependency grammars (see e.g.(Kahane et al., 1998; Lombardo and Lesmo, 1998; Bröker, 1998)) impose on non-projective D-trees some constraints weaker than projectivity (cf. meta-projectivity (Nasr, 1995) or pseudo-projectivity (Kahane et al., 1998)), sufficient for existence of a polynomial time parsing algorithm. Still another approach is developed in the context of intuitionistic resource-dependent logics, where D-trees are constructed from derivations (cf. e.g. a method in (Lecomte, 1992) for Lambek calculus). In this context, non-projective D-trees are determined with the use of hypotheti-cal reasoning and of structural rules such as commutativity and associativity (see e.g. (Moortgat, 1990)).","In this paper, we put forward a novel approach to handling discontinuity in terms of dependency structures. We propose a notion of a polarized dependency (PD-) grammar combining several ideas from cf-tree grammars, dependency grammars and resource-dependent logics. As most dependency grammars, the PD-grammars are analyzing. They reduce continuous groups to their types using local (context-free) reduction rules and simultaneously assign partial dependency structures to reduced groups. The valencies (positive for governors and negative for subordinates) are used to specify discontinuous (long) dependencies lacking in partial dependency structures. The mechanism of establishing long dependencies is orthogonal to reduction and is implemented by a universal and simple rule of valencies saturation. A simplified version of PD-grammars adapted for the theoretical analysis is introduced and explored in (Dikovsky, 2001). In this paper, we describe a notion of PD-grammar more adapted for practical tasks."]},{"title":"2 Dependency structures","paragraphs":["We fix finite alphabets","of terminals (words), of nonterminals (syntactic types or classes), and ","of dependency names.

Even if in a reduction to an axiom all valencies are saturated, this does not guarantee that a D-tree is derived: the graph may have cycles. In (Dikovsky, 2001) we give a sufficient condition for a PD-grammar of never producing cycles while FA-saturation. We call the grammars satisfying this condition lc- (locally cycle-) free. For the space reasons, we don’t cite its definition, the more so that the linguistic PD-grammars should certainly be lc-free. In (Dikovsky, 2001) we prove the following theorem. Theorem 1. For any lc-free PD-grammar ","of bounded defect there is an equivalent cf-grammar.","Together with this we show an example of a DT-language which cannot be determined by local PD-grammars.

In fact, it is the classical Earley algorithm in charter form (the charters being DV-structures). To apply this algorithm in practice, we should analyze the asymptotic factor which depends on the size of the grammar. The idea of theorem 1 is that the integral valency being bounded, it can be compiled into types. This means that a reduction rule","","","should be substituted by rules "," ","","","",""," ","","","","with","types keeping all possible integral valencies not","causing cycles.

Practi-","cally, the effect may be that some local rules will","have variants propagating upwards a certain va-","lency:"," ",""," ","","","","The actual prob-","lem lies elsewhere. Let us analyze the illustration","grammar ","","and the reduction in Fig. 5. This","reduction is successful due to the fact that the","negative valency   "," is assigned to the preposition    and the corresponding positive valency   "," is assigned to the verb    ","What might serve the formal basis for these assignments? Let us start with    ","This verb has the strong government over prepositions       ","In the clause in Fig. 4, the group of the preposition is moved, which is of course a sufficient condition for assigning the positive valency to the verb. But this condition is not available in the dictionary, nor even through morphological analysis (   ","may occur at a certain distance from the end of the clause). So it can only be derived in the course of reduction, but strict PD-grammars have no rules assigning valencies. Theoretically, there is no problem: we should just introduce into the dictionary both variants of the verb description – with the local dependency    "," to the right and with the positive valency   ","","to the left. Practically, this “solution” is inacceptable because such a lexical ambiguity will lead to a brute force search. The same argument shows that we shouldn’t assign the negative valency   "," to   ","in the dictionary, but rather “calculate” it in the reduction. If we compare the clause in Fig. 4 with the clauses what theories we may rely upon; what kind of theories we may rely upon; the dependency theories of what kind we may rely upon etc., we see that we can assign a","valency to wh-words in the dictionary and then raise negative valencies till the FA-saturation. The problem is that in the strict PD-grammars there are no rules of valency raising. For these reasons we extend the reduction rules by side effects sufficient for the calculations of both kinds. Definition 8. We introduce two kinds of side effects: valency raising              and valency assignment      "," ","being valency names and  an integer.
