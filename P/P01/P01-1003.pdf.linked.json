Statistical language models have gained considerable acceptance due to the efficiency demonstrated in the fields in which they have been applied (Bahal et al., 1983; Jelinek et al., 1991; Ratnapharkhi, 1998; Borthwick, 1999).","Traditional statistical language models calculate the probability of a sentence","using the chain rule:","","","","  "," ","  ","","(1)  This work has been partially supported by the Spanish","CYCIT under contract (TIC98/0423-C06).

The effort in the language","modeling techniques is usually directed to the es-","timation of","","","",". The language model defined","by the expression","","","","is named the condi-","tional language model. In principle, the deter-","mination of the conditional probability in (1) is","expensive, because the possible number of word","sequences is very great. Traditional conditional","language models assume that the probability of","the word  does not depend on the entire history,","and the history is limited by an equivalence rela-","tion",", and (1) is rewritten as:","","","   ","","","  "," ","","","   ","","","(2)","The most commonly used conditional language model is the n-gram model. In the n-gram model, the history is reduced (by the equivalence rela-tion) to the last","words. The power of the n-gram model resides in: its consistence with the training data, its simple formulation, and its easy implementation. However, the n-gram model only uses the information provided by the last ","words to predict the next word and so only makes use of local information. In addition, the value of n must be low (",") because for there are problems with the parameter estimation.","Hybrid models have been proposed, in an at-tempt to supplement the local information with long-distance information. They combine different types of models, like n-grams, with long-distance information, generally by means of linear interpolation, as has been shown in (Bellegarda, 1998; Chelba and Jelinek, 2000; Benedı́ and Sánchez, 2000).","A formal framework to include long-distance and local information in the same language model is based on the Maximum Entropy principle (ME). Using the ME principle, we can combine information from a variety of sources into the same language model (Berger et al., 1996; Rosenfeld, 1996). The goal of the ME principle is that, given a set of features (pieces of desired information contained in the sentence), a set of functions ","","(measuring the contribution of each","feature to the model) and a set of constraints1",", we","have to find the probability distribution that satis-","fies the constraints and minimizes the relative en-","tropy (Divergence of Kullback-Leibler)","","","","",",","with respect to the distribution",".","The general Maximum Entropy probability dis-","tribution relative to a prior distribution","","is given","by the expression:","","","  ","","","(3) where  is the normalization constant and","","are","parameters to be found. The","","represent the con-","tribution of each feature to the distribution.","From (3) it is easy to derive the Maximum","Entropy conditional language model (Rosenfeld,","1996): if","is the context space and","is the","vocabulary, then","x","is the states space, and if",""," x","then:","   ",""," ",""," ","","(4) and","   :","  ",""," ","","(5) where","","is the normalization constant depend-ing on the context",". Although the conditional ME language model is more flexible than n-gram models, there is an important obstacle to its general use: conditional ME language models have a high computational cost (Rosenfeld, 1996), specially the evaluation of the normalization constant (5).","1","The constraints usually involve the equality between theoretical expectation and the empirical expectation over the training corpus.","Although we can incorporate local information (like n-grams) and some kinds of long-distance information (like triggers) within the conditional ME model, the global information contained in the sentence is poorly encoded in the ME model, as happens with the other conditional models.","There is a language model which is able to take advantage of the local information and at the same time allows for the use of the global properties of the sentence: the Whole Sentence Maximum Entropy model (WSME) (Rosenfeld, 1997). We can include classical information such us n-grams, distance n-grams or triggers and global properties of the sentence, as features into the WSME framework. Besides the fact that the WSME model training procedure is less expensive than the conditional ME model, the most important training step is based on well-developed statistical sampling techniques. In recent works (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999a), WSME models have been successfully trained using features of n-grams and distance n-grams.","In this work, we propose adding information to the WSME model which is provided by the grammatical structure of the sentence. The information is added in the form of features by means of a Stochastic Context-Free Grammar (SCFG). The grammatical information is combined with features of n-grams and triggers.","In section 2, we describe the WSME model and the training procedure in order to estimate the parameters of the model. In section 3, we define the grammatical features and the way of obtaining them from the SCFG. Finally, section 4 presents the experiments carried out using a part of the Wall Street Journal in order evalute the behavior of this proposal."]},{"title":"2 Whole Sentence Maximum Entropy Model","paragraphs":["The whole sentence Maximum Entropy model directly models the probability distribution of the complete sentence2",". The WSME language model has the form of (3). In order to simplify the notation we write","   ",", and define: 2 By sentence, we understand any sequence of linguistic","units that belongs to a certain vocabulary.","    ","    ","(6) so (3) is written as:","","  ","",""," (7)","where","is a sentence and the","","are now the pa-","rameters to be learned.","The training procedure to estimate the parame-","ters of the model is the Improved Iterative Scaling","algorithmn (IIS) (Della Pietra et al., 1995). IIS is","based on the change of the log-likelihood over the","training corpus",", when each of the parameters","changes from","","to","",",","",".

In each iteration of","the IIS, we have to find the value of the improve-","ment","","in the parameters, solving (8) with respect","to for each","",". The main obstacle in the WSME training pro-","cess resides in the calculation of the first sum in","(8). The sum extends over all the sentences","of","a given length. The great number of such sen-","tences makes it impossible, from computing per-","spective, to calculate the sum, even for a moderate","length3",". Nevertheless, such a sum is the statisti-","cal expected value of a function of","with respect","to the distribution",":","   ","",". As is well","known, it could be estimated using the sampling","expectation as:   ","   ",""," ","  ","    ","","   ","(9)","where "," ","is a random sample from and","  ","","",". Note that in (7) the constant ","is unknown,","so direct sampling from","is not possible. In","sampling from such types of probability distribu-","tions, the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)","3","the number of sentences of length","is",""," sampling methods have been successfully used when the distribition is not totally known (Neal, 1993). MCMC are based on the convergence of certain Markov Chains to a target distribution",". In MCMC, a path of the Markov chain is ran for a long time, after which the visited states are considered as a sampling element. The MCMC sampling methods have been used in the parameter estimation of the WSME language models, specially the Independence Metropolis-Hasting (IMH) and the Gibb’s sampling algorithms (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999a; Rosenfeld, 1997). The best results have been obtainded using the (IMH) algorithm.","Although MCMC performs well, the distribution from which the sample is obtained is only an approximation of the target sampling distribution. Therefore samples obtained from such distributions may produce some bias in sample statistics, like sampling mean. Recently, another sampling technique which is also based on Markov Chains has been developed by Propp and Wilson (Propp and Wilson, 1996), the Perfect Sampling (PS) technique. PS is based on the concept of Coupling From the Past. In PS, several paths of the Markov chain are running from the past (one path in each state of the chain). In all the paths, the transition rule of the Markov chain uses the same set of random numbers to transit from one state to another. Thus if two paths coincide in the same state in time",", they will remain in the same states the rest of the time. In such a case, we say that the two paths are collapsed.","Now, if all the paths collapse at any given time, from that point in time, we are sure that we are sampling from the true target distribution",". The Coupling From the Past algorithm, systematically goes to the past and then runs paths in all states and repeats this procedure until a time","has been found. Once","has been found, the paths that be-gin in time","all paths collapse at time",". Then we run a path of the chain from the state at time","to the actual time (","), and the last state arrived is a sample from the target distribution. The reason for going from past to current time is technical, and is detailed in (Propp and Wilson, 1996). If the state space is huge (as is the case where the state space is the set of all sentences), we must define a stochastic order over the state space and then run only two paths: one beginning in the minimum state and the other in the maximum state, following the same mechanism described above for the two paths until they collapse. In this way, it is proved that we get a sample from the exact target distribution and not from an approximate distribution as in MCMC algorithms (Propp and Wilson, 1996). Thus, we hope that in samples generated with perfect sampling, statistical parameter estimators may be less biased than those generated with MCMC.","Recently (Amaya and Benedı́, 2000), the PS was successfully used to estimate the parameters of a WSME language model . In that work, a comparison was made between the performance of WSME models trained using MCMC and WSME models trained using PS. Features of n-grams and features of triggers were used In both kinds of models, and the WSME model trained with PS had better performance. We then considered it appropriate to use PS in the training procedure of the WSME.","The model parameters were completed with the estimation of the global normalization constant  . Using (7), we can deduce that  ","   and thus estimate  using the sampling expectation.

Grammatical information may be helpful in many aplications of computational linguistics. The grammatical structure of the sentence provides long-distance information to the model, thereby complementing the information provided by other sources and improving the performance of the model. Grammatical features give a better weight to such parameters in grammatically correct sentences than in grammatically incorrect sentences, thereby help-ing the model to assign better probabilities to correct sentences from the language of the applica-tion. To capture the grammatical information, we use Stochastic Context-Free Grammars (SCFG).","Over the last decade, there has been an increas-ing interest in Stochastic Context-Free Grammars (SCFGs) for use in different tasks (K., 1979; Jelinek, 1991; Ney, 1992; Sakakibara, 1990). The reason for this can be found in the capability of SCFGs to model the long-term dependencies established between the different lexical units of a sentence, and the possibility to incorporate the stochastic information that allows for an adequate modeling of the variability phenomena. Thus, SCFGs have been successfully used on limited-domain tasks of low perplexity. However, SCFGs work poorly for large vocabulary, generalpurpose tasks, because the parameter learning and the computation of word transition probabilities present serious problems for complex real tasks.","To capture the long-term relations and to solve the main problem derived from the use of SCFGs in large-vocabulary complex tasks,we consider the proposal in (Benedı́ and Sánchez, 2000): define a category-based SCFG and a probabilistic model of word distribution in the categories. The use of categories as terminal of the grammar reduces the number of rules to take into account and thus, the time complexity of the SCFG learning procedure. The use of the probabilistic model of word distribution in the categories, allows us to obtain the best derivation of the sentences in the application.","Actually, we have to solve two problems: the estimation of the parameters of the models and their integration to obtain the best derivation of a sentence.","The parameters of the two models are estimated from a training sample. Each word in the training sample has a part-of-speech tag (POStag) associated to it. These POStags are considered as word categories and are the terminal symbols of our SCFG.","Given a category, the probability distribution of a word is estimated by means of the relative frequency of the word in the category, i.e. the relative frequency which the word","has been labeled with a POStag (a word","may belong to different categories).","To estimate the SCFG parameters, several algorithms have been presented (K. and S.J., 1991; Pereira and Shabes, 1992; Amaya et al., 1999; Sánchez and Benedı́, 1999). Taking into account the good results achieved on real tasks (Sánchez and Benedı́, 1999), we used them to learn our category-based SCFG.","To solve the integration problem, we used an algorithm that computes the probability of the best derivation that generates a sentence, given the category-based grammar and the model of word distribution into categories (Benedı́ and Sánchez, 2000). This algorithm is based on the well-known Viterbi-like scheme for SCFGs.","Once the grammatical framework is defined, we are in position to make use of the information provided by the SCFG. In order to define the grammatical features, we first introduce some notation.","A Context-Free Grammar G is a four-tuple ","",", where","is the finite set of non terminals,","is a finite set of terminals (","",", ","","","is the initial symbol of the grammar and is the finite set of productions or rules of the form"," where "," ","and ","","",".

A Stochastic Context-Free Gramar","","is a pair","","  ","where","is a context-free grammar and","is","a probability distribution over the grammar rules.

As mentioned above, we can compute the","best derivation of the sentence",", using the defined","SCFG and obtain the parse tree of the sentence.

This corpus was automatically labelled and manually checked. There were two kinds of labelling: POStag labelling and syntactic labelling. The POStag vocabulary was composed of 45 labels. The syntactic labels are 14. The corpus was divided into sentences according to the bracketing.","We selected 12 sections of the corpus at random. Six were used as training corpus, three as test set and the other three sections were used as held-out for tuning the smoothing WSME model. The sets are described as follow: the training corpus has 11,201 sentences; the test set has 6,350 sentences and the held-out set has 5,796 sentences.","A base-line Katz back-off smoothed trigram model was trained using the CMU-Cambridge statistical Language Modeling Toolkit 4","and used as prior distribution in (3) i.e.",".

The initial probabilities were randomly generated and three different seeds were tested. However, only one of them is here given that the results were very similar.","The size of the sample used in the ISS was estimated by means of an experimental procedure and was set at 10,000 elements. The procedure used to generate the sample made use of the “diagnosis of convergence” (Neal, 1993), a method by means of which an inicial portion of each run of the Markov chain of sufficient length is discarded. Thus, the states in the remaining portion come from the desired equilibrium distribution. In this work, a discarded portion of 3,000 elements was establiched. Thus in practice, we have to generate 13,000 instances of the Markov chain.","During the IIS, every sample was tagged using the grammar estimated above, and then the grammatical features were extracted, before combining them with other kinds of features. The adequate number of iterations of the IIS was established experimentally in 13.","We trained several WSME models using the Perfect Sampling algorithm in the IIS and a different set of features (including the grammatical features) for each model.
