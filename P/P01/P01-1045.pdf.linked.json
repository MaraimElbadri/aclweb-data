Chunk parsing (Abney, 1991; Abney, 1996) offers a particularly promising and by now widely used example of the former kind. The main insight that underlies the chunk parsing strategy is to isolate the (finite-state) analysis of non-recursive syntactic structure, i.e. chunks, from larger, recursive structures. This results in a highly-efficient parsing architecture that is realized as a cascade of finite-state transducers and that pursues a leftmost longest-match pattern-matching strategy at each level of analysis.","Despite the popularity of the chunk parsing approach, there seems to be a gap in current research:","Chunk parsing research has focused on the recognition of partial constituent structures at the level of individual chunks. By comparison, little or no attention has been paid to the question of how such partial analyses can be combined into larger structures for complete utterances. Such larger structures are not only desirable for a deeper syntactic analysis; they also constitute a necessary prerequisite for assigning function-argument structure.","Automatic assignment of function-argument structure has long been recognized as a desideratum beyond pure syntactic labeling (Marcus et al., 1994)1",". The present paper offers a similarity-","1","With the exception of dependency-grammar-based parsers (Tapanainen and Järvinen, 1997; Bröker et al., 1994; Lesmo and Lombardo, 2000), where functional labels are treated as first-class citizens as relations between words, and recent work on a semi-automatic method for treebank construction (Brants et al., 1997), little has been reported on based algorithm for assigning functional labels such as subject, object, head, complement, etc. to complete syntactic structures on the basis of pre-chunked input. The evaluation of the algorithm has concentrated on measuring the quality of these functional labels."]},{"title":"2 The T üSBL Architecture","paragraphs":["In order to ensure a robust and efficient architecture, T üSBL, a similarity-based chunk parser, is organized in a three-level architecture, with the output of each level serving as input for the next higher level. The first level is part-of-speech (POS) tagging of the input string with the help of the bigram tagger LIKELY (Feldweg, 1993).2 The parts of speech serve as pre-terminal elements for the next step, i.e. the chunk analysis. Chunk parsing is carried out by an adapted version of Abney’s (1996) CASS parser, which is realized as a cascade of finite-state transducers. The chunks, which extend if possible to the simplex clause level, are then remodeled into complete trees in the tree construction level.","The tree construction level is similar to the DOP approach (Bod, 1998; Bod, 2000) in that it uses complete tree structures instead of rules. Contrary to Bod, we only use the complete trees and do not allow tree cuts. Thus the number of possible combinations of partial trees is strictly controlled. The resulting parser is highly efficient (3770 English sentences took 106.5 seconds to parse on an Ultra Sparc 10)."]},{"title":"3 Chunking and Tree Construction","paragraphs":["The division of labor between the chunking and tree construction modules can best be illustrated by an example.","For sentences such as the input shown in Fig. 1, the chunker produces a structure in which some constituents remain unattached or partially annotated in keeping with the chunk-parsing strategy to factor out recursion and to resolve only unambiguous attachments.","Since chunks are by definition non-recursive structures, a chunk of a given category cannot fully automatic recognition of functional labels.","2","The inventory of POS tags is based on the STTS (Schiller et al., 1995) for German and on the Penn Treebank tagset (Santorini, 1990) for English.

In the case at hand, the two prepositional phrases (’prep p’) about nine and in the evening in the chunk output cannot be combined into a single chunk, even though semantically these words constitute a single constituent. At the level of tree construction, as shown in Fig. 2, the prohibition against recursive phrases is suspended. Therefore, the proper PP attachment becomes possible. Additionally, the phrase about nine was wrongly categorized as a ’prep p’. Such miscategorizations can arise if a given word can be assigned more than one POS tag. In the case of about the tags ’in’ (for: preposition) or ’rb’ (for: ad-verb) would be appropriate. However, since the POS tagger cannot resolve this ambiguity from local context, the underspecified tag ’about’ is assigned, instead. However, this can in turn lead to misclassification in the chunker.","The most obvious deficiency of the chunk output shown in Fig. 1 is that the structure does not contain any information about the function-argument structure of the chunked phrases. However, once a (more) complete parse structure is created, the grammatical function of each major constituent needs to be identified. The labels SUBJ (for: subject), HD (for: head), ADJ (for: adjunct) COMP (for: complement), SPR (for: specifier), which appear as edge-labels between tree nodes in Fig. 2, signify the grammatical functions of the constituents in question.

This paradigm is an instance of lazy learning in the sense that these previously encountered instances are stored “as is” and are crucially not abstracted over, as is typically the case in rule-based systems or other learning approaches. Previous applications of","5","Memory-based learning has recently been applied to a variety of NLP classification tasks, including part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase chunking, grapheme-phoneme conversion, word sense disambiguation, and PP attachment (see (Daelemans et al., 1999; Veenstra et al., 2000; Zavrel et al., 1997) for details). memory-based learning to NLP tasks consisted of classification problems in which the set of classes to be learnt was simple in the sense that the class items did not have any internal structure and the number of distinct items was small. Since in the current application, the set of classes are parse trees, the classification task is much more complex. The classification is simple only in those cases where a direct hit is found, i.e. where a complete match of the input with a stored instance exists. In all other cases, the most similar tree from the instance base needs to be modified to match the chunked input. This means that the output tree will group together only those elements from the chunked input for which there is evidence in the instance base. If these strategies fail for complete chunks, T üSBL attempts to match smaller subchunks.","The algorithm used for tree construction is presented in a slightly simplified form in Figs. 5-8. For readability, we assume here that chunks and complete trees share the same data structure so that subroutines like string yield can operate on both of them indiscriminately.","The main routine construct tree in Fig. 5 separates the list of input chunks and passes each one to the subroutine process chunk in Fig. 6 where the chunk is then turned into one or more (partial) trees. process chunk first checks if a complete match with an instance from the instance base is possible.6","If this is not the case, a partial match on the lexical level is attempted. If a partial tree is found, attach next chunk in Fig. 7 and extend tree in Fig. 8 are used to extend the tree by either attaching one more chunk or by resorting to a comparison of the missing parts of the chunk with tree extensions on the POS level. attach next chunk is necessary to ensure that the best possible tree is found even in the rare case that the original segmentation into chunks contains mistakes. If no partial tree is found, the tree construction backs off to finding a complete match at the POS level or to starting the subroutine for processing a chunk recursively with all the subchunks of the present chunk.","The application of memory-based techniques is implemented in the two subroutines complete match and partial match. The presentation of the two cases as two separate subroutines is for expository purposes only. In the actual implementation, the search is carried out only once. The two subroutines exist because of the postprocess-ing of the chosen tree, which is necessary for partial matches and which also deviates from standard memory-based applications. Postprocessing mainly consists of shortening the tree from the instance base so that it covers only those parts of the chunk that could be matched. However, if the match is done on the lexical level, a correction of tagging errors is possible if there is enough evidence in the instance base. T üSBL currently uses an overlap metric, the most basic metric for in-","6","string yield returns the sequence of words included in the input structure, pos yield the sequence of POS tags. stances with symbolic features, as its similarity metric. This overlap metric is based on either lexical or POS features. Instead of applying a more sophisticated metric like the weighted overlap metric, T üSBL uses a backing-off approach that heavily favors similarity of the input with pre-stored instances on the basis of substring identity. Splitting up the classification and adaptation process into different stages allows T üSBL to prefer analyses with a higher likelihood of being correct. This strategy enables corrections of tagging and segmentation errors that may occur in the chunked input."]},{"title":"5 Quantitative Evaluation","paragraphs":["Quantitive evaluations of robust parsers typically focus on the three PARSEVAL measures: labeled precision, labeled recall and crossing accuracy. It has frequently been pointed out that these evaluation parameters provide little or no information as to whether a parser assigns the correct semantic structure to a given input, if the set of category labels comprises only syntactic categories in the narrow sense, i.e. includes only names of lexical and phrasal categories. This justified criticism observes that a measure of semantic accuracy can only be obtained if the gold standard includes an-notations of syntactic-semantic dependencies between bracketed constituents. It is to answer this criticism that the evaluation of the T üSBL system presented here focuses on the correct assignment of functional labels. For an in-depth evaluation that focuses on syntactic categories, we refer the interested reader to (Kübler and Hinrichs, 2001).","The quantitative evaluation of T üSBL has been conducted on the treebanks of German and English described in section 3. Each treebank uses a different annotation scheme at the level of function-argument structure. As shown in Table 1, the English treebank uses a total of 13 functional labels, while the German treebank has a richer set of 36 function labels.","The evaluation consisted of a ten-fold crossvalidation test, where the training data provide an instance base of already seen cases for T üSBL’s tree construction module.

We have, therefore divided the incorrectly matched nodes into three categories: the genuine false positives where a tree structure is found that matches the gold standard, but is assigned the wrong label; nodes which, relative to the gold standard, remain unattached in the output tree; and nodes contained in the gold standard for which no match could be found in the parser output. Our approach follows a strategy of positing and attaching nodes only if sufficient evidence can be found in the instance base. Therefore the latter two categories cannot really be considered errors in the strict sense. Nevertheless, in future research we will attempt to significantly reduce the proportion of unattached and unmatched nodes by exploring matching algorithms that permit a higher level of generaliza-tion when matching the input against the instance base. What is encouraging about the recall results reported in Table 2 is that the parser produces genuine false positives for an average of only 3.03 % for German and 3.25 % for English.","For German, labeled precision for syntactic categories yielded 81.56 % correctness. While these results do not reach the performance reported for other parsers (cf. (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 1997)), it is important to note that the two treebanks consist of transliterated spontaneous speech data. The fragmentary and partially illformed nature of such spoken data makes them harder to analyze than written data such as the Penn treebank typically used as gold standard.","It should also be kept in mind that the basic PARSEVAL measures were developed for parsers that have as their main goal a complete analysis that spans the entire input. This runs counter to the basic philosophy underlying an amended chunk parser such as T üSBL, which has as its main goal robustness of partially analyzed structures.","Labeled precision of functional labels for the German data resulted in a score of 89.73 % correctness. For English, precision of functional labels was 90.40 %. The slightly lower correctness rate for German is a reflection of the larger set of function labels used by the grammar. This raises interesting more general issues about trade-offs in accuracy and granularity of functional annotations."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and Future Research","paragraphs":["The results of 89.73 % (German) and 90.40 % (English) correctly assigned functional labels validate the general approach. We anticipate further improvements by experimenting with more sophisticated similarity metrics7","and by enrich-ing the linguistic information in the instance base. The latter can, for example, be achieved by preserving more structural information contained in the chunk parse. Yet another dimension for experimentation concerns the way in which the algorithm generalizes over the instance base. In the current version of the algorithm, generaliza-tion heavily relies on lexical and part-of-speech information. However, a richer set of backing-off strategies that rely on larger domains of structure are easy to envisage and are likely to significantly improve recall performance.","While we intend to pursue all three dimensions of refining the basic algorithm reported here, we have to leave an experimentation of which modifications yield improved results to future research."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Steven Abney. 1991.
