This additional information could be:","","Simple context information: information of","the words surrounding the word pair;"," Syntactic information: part-of-speech information, syntactic constituent, sentence mood;"," Semantic information: disambiguation information (e.g. from WordNet), current/previous speech or dialog act. To include this additional information within the statistical framework we use the maximum entropy approach. This approach has been applied in natural language processing to a variety of tasks. (Berger et al., 1996) applies this approach to the so-called IBM Candide system to build context dependent models, compute automatic sentence splitting and to improve word reordering in translation. Similar techniques are used in (Papineni et al., 1996; Papineni et al., 1998) for so-called direct translation models instead of those proposed in (Brown et al., 1993). (Foster, 2000) describes two methods for incorporating information about the relative position of bilingual word pairs into a maximum entropy translation model. Other authors have applied this approach to language modeling (Rosenfeld, 1996; Martin et al., 1999; Peters and Klakow, 1999). A short review of the maximum entropy approach is outlined in Section 3."]},{"title":"2 Statistical Machine Translation","paragraphs":["The goal of the translation process in statisti-","cal machine translation can be formulated as fol-","lows: A source language string ","",""," ","is to be translated into a target language string",""," ","","","  .

We use the program GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000b; Och and Ney, 2000a), which is an extension of the training program available in EGYPT (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999).","Berger et al.

Unfortunately, our","-best","extraction algorithm is sub-optimal, i.e. not the","true best translations are extracted. In addition,","so far we had to use a limit of only ","","translations per sentence. Therefore, the results of the translation experiments are only preliminary.","For the evaluation of the translation quality we use the automatically computable Word Error Rate (WER). The WER corresponds to the edit distance between the produced translation and one predefined reference translation. A shortcoming of the WER is the fact that it requires a perfect word order. This is particularly a problem for the Verbmobil task, where the word order of the German-English sentence pair can be quite different. As a result, the word order of the automatically generated target sentence can be different from that of the target sentence, but nevertheless acceptable so that the WER measure alone can be misleading. In order to overcome this problem, we introduce as additional measure the position-independent word error rate (PER). This measure compares the words in the two sentences without taking the word order into account. Depending on whether the translated sentence is longer or shorter than the target translation, the remaining words result in either insertion or dele-tion errors in addition to substitution errors. The PER is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the WER.","We use the top-10 list of hypothesis provided by the translation system described in (Tillmann and Ney, 2000) for rescoring the hypothesis using the ME models and sort them according to the new maximum entropy score. The translation results in terms of error rates are shown in Table 8. We use Model 4 in order to perform the translation experiments because Model 4 typically gives better translation results than Model 5.","We see that the translation quality improves slightly with respect to the WER and PER. The translation quality improvements so far are quite small compared to the perplexity measure improvements. We attribute this to the fact that the algorithm for computing the","-best lists is suboptimal.
