Methods used range from pure frequency counts to information theoretic measures and statistical significance tests. While the mathematical properties of those measures have been extensively discussed,1 the strategies employed for evaluating the identification results are far from adequate. Another crucial but still unsolved issue in statistical collocation identification is the treatment of low-frequency data.","In this paper, we firstspecify requirements for a qualitative evaluation of lexical association mea-","1","See for instance (Manning and Schütze, 1999, chapter 5), (Kilgarriff, 1996), and (Pedersen, 1996). sures (AMs).

See section 3 for a description of the base data. For evaluation of the association measures,  -best strategies (section 4.1) are supplemented with precision and recall graphs (section 4.2) over the complete data sets. Samples comprising particular frequency strata (high versus low frequencies) are examined (section 4.3).

This method leads to a very superficial judgment of AMs for the following reasons:","(1) The identificationresults are based on small subsets of the candidates extracted from the corpus. Consequently, results achieved by individual measures may very well be due to chance (cf. sections 4.1 and 4.2), and evaluation with respect to frequency strata is not possible (cf. section 4.3). (2) For the same reason, it is impossible to determine recall values, which are important for many practical applications. (3) The introduction of new measures or changes to the calculation methods require additional manual evaluation, as new","-best lists are generated. 2.2 Requirements To improve the reliability of the evaluation results, a number of properties need to be controlled. We distinguish between two classes:","(1) Characteristics of the set of candidate data employed for collocation identification: (i) the syntactic homogeneity of the base data, i.e., whether the set of candidate data consists only of adjective-noun, noun-verb, etc. pairs or whether different types of word combinations are mixed; (ii) the grammatical status of the individual word combinations in the base set, i.e., whether they are part of or constitute a phrase or simply co-occur within a given text window; (iii) the percentage of TPs in the base set, which is typically higher among high-frequency data than among low-frequency data.","(2) The evaluation strategies applied: Instead of examining only a small sample of","-best candidates for each measure as it is common practice, we make use of recall and precision values for","- best samples of arbitrary size, which allows us to plot recall and precision curves for the whole set of candidate data. In addition, we compare precision curves for different frequency strata."]},{"title":"3 The Base Data","paragraphs":["The base data for our experiments are extracted from two corpora which differ with respect to size and text type. The base sets also differ with respect to syntactic homogeneity and grammatical correctness. Both candidate sets have been manually inspected for TPs.","The first set comprises bigrams of adjacent, lemmatized AdjN pairs extracted from a small ( ","word) corpus of freely available German law texts.3","Due to the extraction strategy, the data are homogeneous and grammatically correct, i.e., there is (almost) always a grammatical dependency between adjacent adjectives and nouns in running text. Two human annotators independently marked candidate pairs perceived as “typical” combinations, including idioms ((die) hohe See, ‘the high seas’), legal terms (üble Nachrede, ‘slander’), and proper names (Rotes Kreuz, ‘Red Cross’). Candidates accepted by either one of the annotators were considered TPs.","The second set consists of PNV triples extracted from an 8 million word portion of the Frankfurter Rundschau Corpus4",", in which part-of-speech tags and minimal PPs were identified.5 The PNV triples were selected automatically such that the preposition and the noun are constituents of the same PP, and the PP and the verb co-occur within a sentence. Only main verbs were considered and full forms were reduced to bases.6 The PNV data are partially inhomogeneous and not fully grammatically correct, because they in-clude combinations with no grammatical relation between PN and V. PNV collocations were manually annotated. The criteria used for the distinction between collocations and arbitrary word combinations are: There is a grammatical relation between the verb and the PP, and the triple can be interpreted as support verb construction and/or a metaphoric or idiomatic reading is available, e.g.: zur Verfügung stellen (at_the availability put, ‘make available’), am Herzen liegen (at the heart lie, ‘have at heart’).7","3","See (Schmid, 1995) for a description of the part-of-speech tagger used to identify adjectives and nouns in the corpus.","4","The Frankfurter Rundschau Corpus is part of the European Corpus Initiative Multilingual Corpus I.","5","See (Skut and Brants, 1998) for a description of the tagger and chunker.","6","Mmorph – the MULTEXT morphology tool provided by ISSCO/SUISSETRA, Geneva, Switzerland – has been employed for determining verb infinitives.","7","For definitions of and literature on idioms, metaphors and support verb constructions (Funktionsverbgefüge) see for instance (Bußmann, 1990).","AdjN data PNV data","total 11 087 total 294 534",""," 4 652"," ","14 654","colloc. 15.84% colloc. 6.41%","   = 737","","",""," = 939 Table 1: Base sets used for evaluation","General statistics for the AdjN and PNV base sets are given in Table 1.

The picture differs slightly for the PNV data (Figure 2). Here t-test outperforms log-likelihood, and even precision gained by frequency is better than or at least comparable to log-likelihood. These pairings – log-likelihood and t-test for AdjN, and t-test and frequency for PNV – are also visible in the recall curves (Figures 3 and 4). Moreover, for the PNV data the t-test leads to a recall of over 60% when approx. 20% of the SL has been considered.","In the Figures above, there are a number of positions on the","-axis where the precision and recall values of different measures are almost identical.

However, the full curves in Figures 2 and 4 show that t-test is consistently better than frequency. 4.3 Frequency Strata While we have previously considered data from a broad frequency range (i.e., frequencies"," "," for AdjN and"," ","","for PNV), we will now split up the candidate sets into high-frequency and low-frequency occurrences.

This is a widely used strategy, and it is motivated by the fact that it is in general highly problematic to draw conclusions from low-frequency data with statistical methods (cf. Weeber et al. (2000) and Figure 8). A practical reason for cutting off low-frequency data is the need to reduce the amount of manual work when the complete data set has to be evaluated, which is a precondition for the exact calculation of recall and for plotting precision curves.","The major drawback of an approach where all low-frequency candidates are excluded is that a large part of the data is lost for collocation extraction. In our data, for instance, 80% of the full set of PNV data and 58% of the AdjN data are hapaxes. Thus it is important to know how many (and which) true collocations there are among the excluded low-frequency candidates.","5.1 Statistical Estimation of TPs among Low-Frequency Data In this section, we estimate the number of collocations in the data excluded from our experiments (i.e., AdjN pairs with"," "," and PNV triples with","","  ","","). Because of the large num-","ber of candidates in those sets (6 435 for AdjN, 10 According to the -test as described in section 6. 279 880 for PNV), manual inspection of the entire data is impractical. Therefore, we use random samples from the candidate sets to obtain estimates for the proportion","of true collocations among the low-frequency data. We randomly selected 965 items (15%) from the AdjN hapaxes, and 983 items ( ","0.35%) from the low-frequency PNV triples. Manual examination of the samples yielded 31 TPs for AdjN (a proportion of 3.2%) and 6 TPs for PNV (0.6%).","Considering the low proportion of collocations in the samples, we must expect highly skewed frequency distributions (where","is very small), which are problematic for standard statistical tests. In order to obtain reliable estimates, we have used an exact test based on the following model: Assuming a proportion","of TPs in the full low-frequency data (AdjN or PNV), the number of TPs in a random sample of size","is described by a binomially distributed random variable with parameter",".11","Consequently, the probability of finding","or less TPs in the sample is ","      ","","","    ","","  ",".
