By recording rule instances rather than derived facts, a packed representation of the complete set of Datalog derivation trees for a given query can also be obtained in polynomial time by the same technique. Since a Datalog derivation tree uniquely determines a grammar derivation tree, this gives a reduction of context-free recognition and parsing to query evaluation in Datalog.","In this paper, we show that a similar reduction to Datalog is possible for more powerful grammar formalisms with “context-free” derivations, such as (multi-component) tree-adjoining grammars (Joshi and Schabes, 1997; Weir, 1988), IO macro grammars (Fisher, 1968), and (parallel) multiple context-free grammars (Seki et al., 1991).

The reduction can also be used to obtain a tight upper bound, namely LOGCFL, on the computational complexity of the problem of recognition, both for grammaticality of input strings and for surface realizability of input logical forms.","With regard to parsing and recognition of input strings, polynomial-time algorithms and the LOGCFL upper bound on the computational complexity are already known for the grammar formalisms covered by our results (Engelfriet, 1986); nevertheless, we believe that our reduction to Datalog offers valuable insights.

In particular, it shows that the use of higher-order λ-terms for semantic representation need not be avoided for the purpose of achieving computational tractability."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Aoto, Takahito. 1999.
