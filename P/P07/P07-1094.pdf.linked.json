Recently, several new model-based approaches have improved performance on a variety of tasks (Klein and Manning, 2002; Smith and","∗","This work was supported by grants NSF 0631518 and ONR MURI N000140510388. We would also like to thank Noah Smith for providing us with his data sets. Eisner, 2005). Nearly all of these approaches have one aspect in common: the goal of learning is to identify the set of model parameters that maximizes some objective function. Values for the hidden variables in the model are then chosen based on the learned parameterization. Here, we propose a different approach based on Bayesian statistical principles: rather than searching for an optimal set of parameter values, we seek to directly maximize the probability of the hidden variables given the observed data, integrating over all possible parameter values. Using part-of-speech (POS) tagging as an example application, we show that the Bayesian approach provides large performance improvements over maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) for the same model structure. Two factors can explain the improvement. First, integrating over parameter values leads to greater robustness in the choice of tag sequence, since it must have high probability over a range of parameters. Second, integration permits the use of priors favoring sparse distributions, which are typical of natural language. These kinds of priors can lead to degenerate solutions if the parameters are estimated directly.","Before describing our approach in more detail, we briefly review previous work on unsupervised POS tagging. Perhaps the most well-known is that of Merialdo (1994), who used MLE to train a trigram hidden Markov model (HMM). More recent work has shown that improvements can be made by modifying the basic HMM structure (Banko and Moore, 2004), using better smoothing techniques or added constraints (Wang and Schuurmans, 2005), or using a discriminative model rather than an HMM 744 (Smith and Eisner, 2005). Non-model-based approaches have also been proposed (Brill (1995); see also discussion in Banko and Moore (2004)). All of this work is really POS disambiguation: learning is strongly constrained by a dictionary listing the allowable tags for each word in the text. Smith and Eisner (2005) also present results using a diluted dictionary, where infrequent words may have any tag. Haghighi and Klein (2006) use a small list of labeled prototypes and no dictionary.","A different tradition treats the identification of syntactic classes as a knowledge-free clustering problem. Distributional clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques are typically applied when linguistically meaningful classes are desired (Schütze, 1995; Clark, 2000; Finch et al., 1995); probabilistic models have been used to find classes that can improve smoothing and reduce perplexity (Brown et al., 1992; Saul and Pereira, 1997). Unfortunately, due to a lack of standard and informative evaluation techniques, it is difficult to compare the effectiveness of different clustering methods.","In this paper, we hope to unify the problems of POS disambiguation and syntactic clustering by presenting results for conditions ranging from a full tag dictionary to no dictionary at all. We introduce the use of a new information-theoretic criterion, variation of information (Meilǎ, 2002), which can be used to compare a gold standard clustering to the clustering induced from a tagger’s output, regardless of the cluster labels. We also evaluate using tag accuracy when possible. Our system outperforms an HMM trained with MLE on both metrics in all circumstances tested, often by a wide margin. Its accuracy in some cases is close to that of Smith and Eisner’s (2005) discriminative model. Our results show that the Bayesian approach is particularly useful when learning is less constrained, either because less evidence is available (corpus size is small) or because the dictionary contains less information.","In the following section, we discuss the motiva-tion for a Bayesian approach and present our model and search procedure. Section 3 gives results illustrating how the parameters of the prior affect results, and Section 4 describes how to infer a good choice of parameters from unlabeled data. Section 5 presents results for a range of corpus sizes and dictionary information, and Section 6 concludes."]},{"title":"2 A Bayesian HMM 2.1 Motivation","paragraphs":["In model-based approaches to unsupervised language learning, the problem is formulated in terms of identifying latent structure from data. We define a model with parameters θ, some observed variables w (the linguistic input), and some latent variables t (the hidden structure). The goal is to as-sign appropriate values to the latent variables. Standard approaches do so by selecting values for the model parameters, and then choosing the most probable variable assignment based on those parameters. For example, maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) seeks parameters θ̂ such that","θ̂ = argmax θ P (w|θ), (1) where P (w|θ) =","∑","t P (w, t|θ). Sometimes, a non-uniform prior distribution over θ is introduced, in which case θ̂ is the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution for θ:","θ̂ = argmax θ P (w|θ)P (θ). (2) The values of the latent variables are then taken to be those that maximize P (t|w, θ̂).","In contrast, the Bayesian approach we advocate in this paper seeks to identify a distribution over latent variables directly, without ever fixing particular values for the model parameters. The distribution over latent variables given the observed data is obtained by integrating over all possible values of θ: P (t|w) = ∫ P (t|w, θ)P (θ|w)dθ. (3) This distribution can be used in various ways, including choosing the MAP assignment to the latent variables, or estimating expected values for them.","To see why integrating over possible parameter values can be useful when inducing latent structure, consider the following example. We are given a coin, which may be biased (t = 1) or fair (t = 0), each with probability .5. Let θ be the probability of heads. If the coin is biased, we assume a uniform distribution over θ, otherwise θ = .5. We observe w, the outcomes of 10 coin flips, and we wish to determine whether the coin is biased (i.e. the value of 745 t). Assume that we have a uniform prior on θ, with p(θ) = 1 for all θ ∈ [0, 1]. First, we apply the standard methodology of finding the MAP estimate for θ and then selecting the value of t that maximizes P (t|w, θ̂). In this case, an elementary calculation shows that the MAP estimate is θ̂ = nH /10, where nH is the number of heads in w (likewise, nT is the number of tails). Consequently, P (t|w, θ̂) favors t = 1 for any sequence that does not contain exactly five heads, and assigns equal probability to t = 1 and t = 0 for any sequence that does contain exactly five heads — a counterintuitive result. In contrast, using some standard results in Bayesian analysis we can show that applying Equation 3 yields P (t = 1|w) = 1/ ( 1 +","11! nH!nT !210 ) (4) which is significantly less than .5 when nH = 5, and only favors t = 1 for sequences where nH ≥ 8 or nH ≤ 2. This intuitively sensible prediction results from the fact that the Bayesian approach is sensitive to the robustness of a choice of t to the value of θ, as illustrated in Figure 1. Even though a sequence with nH = 6 yields a MAP estimate of θ̂ = 0.6 (Figure 1 (a)), P (t = 1|w, θ) is only greater than 0.5 for a small range of θ around θ̂ (Figure 1 (b)), meaning that the choice of t = 1 is not very robust to variation in θ. In contrast, a sequence with nH = 8 favors t = 1 for a wide range of θ around θ̂. By integrating over θ, Equation 3 takes into account the consequences of possible variation in θ.","Another advantage of integrating over θ is that it permits the use of linguistically appropriate priors. In many linguistic models, including HMMs, the distributions over variables are multinomial. For a multinomial with parameters θ = (θ1, . . . , θK ), a natural choice of prior is the K-dimensional Dirichlet distribution, which is conjugate to the multinomial.1","For simplicity, we initially assume that all K parameters (also known as hyperparameters) of the Dirichlet distribution are equal to β, i.e. the Dirichlet is symmetric. The value of β determines which parameters θ will have high probability: when β = 1, all parameter values are equally likely; when β > 1, multinomials that are closer to uniform are 1 A prior is conjugate to a distribution if the posterior has the","same form as the prior.","0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 θ P ( θ | w )   0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 10 0.5 1 θ P ( t = 1 | w , θ )   w = HHTHTTHHTH w = HHTHHHTHHH w = HHTHTTHHTH w = HHTHHHTHHH (a) (b) Figure 1: The Bayesian approach to estimating the value of a latent variable, t, from observed data, w, chooses a value of t robust to uncertainty in θ.

Consequently, it makes sense to use a Dirichlet prior with β < 1. However, as noted by Johnson et al. (2007), this choice of β leads to difficulties with MAP estimation. For a sequence of draws x = (x1, . . . , xn) from a multinomial distribution θ with observed counts n1, . . . , nK , a symmetric Dirichlet(β) prior over θ yields the MAP estimate θk = nk+β−1","n+K(β−1) . When β ≥ 1, standard MLE techniques such as EM can be used to find the MAP estimate simply by adding “pseudocounts” of size β − 1 to each of the expected counts nk at each iteration. However, when β < 1, the values of θ that set one or more of the θk equal to 0 can have infinitely high posterior probability, meaning that MAP estimation can yield degenerate solutions. If, instead of estimating θ, we integrate over all possible values, we no longer encounter such difficulties. Instead, the probability that outcome xi takes value k given previous outcomes x−i = (x1, . . . , xi−1) is P (k|x−i, β) = ∫ P (k|θ)P (θ|x−i, β) dθ =","nk + β i − 1 + Kβ (5) 746 where nk is the number of times k occurred in x−i. See MacKay and Peto (1995) for a derivation. 2.2 Model Definition Our model has the structure of a standard trigram HMM, with the addition of symmetric Dirichlet priors over the transition and output distributions:","ti|ti−1 = t, ti−2 = t′ , τ (t,t′",")","∼ Mult(τ (t,t′ ) ) wi|ti = t, ω(t)","∼ Mult(ω(t)",")","τ (t,t′ ) |α ∼ Dirichlet(α)","ω(t) |β ∼ Dirichlet(β) where ti and wi are the ith tag and word. We assume that sentence boundaries are marked with a distinguished tag. For a model with T possible tags, each of the transition distributions τ (t,t′",")","has T components, and each of the output distributions ω(t)","has Wt components, where Wt is the number of word types that are permissible outputs for tag t. We will use τ and ω to refer to the entire transition and output parameter sets. This model assumes that the prior over state transitions is the same for all histories, and the prior over output distributions is the same for all states. We relax the latter assumption in Section 4.","Under this model, Equation 5 gives us P (ti|t−i, α) = n(ti−2,ti−1,ti) + α n(ti−2,ti−1) + T α (6) P (wi|ti, t−i, w−i, β) = n(ti,wi) + β n(ti) + Wti β (7) where n(ti−2,ti−1,ti) and n(ti,wi) are the number of occurrences of the trigram (ti−2, ti−1, ti) and the tag-word pair (ti, wi) in the i − 1 previously generated tags and words. Note that, by integrating out the parameters τ and ω, we induce dependencies between the variables in the model. The probability of generating a particular trigram tag sequence (likewise, output) depends on the number of times that sequence (output) has been generated previously. Importantly, trigrams (and outputs) remain exchangeable: the probability of a set of trigrams (outputs) is the same regardless of the order in which it was generated. The property of exchangeability is crucial to the inference algorithm we describe next. 2.3 Inference To perform inference in our model, we use Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984), a stochastic procedure that produces samples from the posterior distribution P (t|w, α, β) ∝ P (w|t, β)P (t|α). We initialize the tags at random, then iteratively resample each tag according to its conditional distribution given the current values of all other tags. Exchangeability allows us to treat the current counts of the other tag trigrams and outputs as “previous” observations. The only complication is that resampling a tag changes the identity of three trigrams at once, and we must account for this in computing its conditional distribution. The sampling distribution for ti is given in Figure 2.","In Bayesian statistical inference, multiple samples from the posterior are often used in order to obtain statistics such as the expected values of model variables. For POS tagging, estimates based on multiple samples might be useful if we were interested in, for example, the probability that two words have the same tag. However, computing such probabilities across all pairs of words does not necessarily lead to a consistent clustering, and the result would be difficult to evaluate. Using a single sample makes standard evaluation methods possible, but yields sub-optimal results because the value for each tag is sampled from a distribution, and some tags will be assigned low-probability values. Our solution is to treat the Gibbs sampler as a stochastic search procedure with the goal of identifying the MAP tag sequence. This can be done using tempering (annealing), where a temperature of φ is equivalent to raising the probabilities in the sampling distribution to the power of 1","φ . As φ approaches 0, even a single sample will provide a good MAP estimate."]},{"title":"3 Fixed Hyperparameter Experiments 3.1 Method","paragraphs":["Our initial experiments follow in the tradition begun by Merialdo (1994), using a tag dictionary to constrain the possible parts of speech allowed for each word. (This also fixes Wt, the number of possible words for tag t.) The dictionary was constructed by listing, for each word, all tags found for that word in the entire WSJ treebank. For the experiments in this section, we used a 24,000-word subset of the tree-747 P (ti|t−i, w, α, β) ∝ n(ti,wi) + β nti + Wti β · n(ti−2,ti−1,ti) + α n(ti−2,ti−1) + T α ·","n(ti−1,ti,ti+1) + I(ti−2 = ti−1 = ti = ti+1) + α n(ti−1,ti) + I(ti−2 = ti−1 = ti) + T α ·","n(ti,ti+1,ti+2) + I(ti−2 = ti = ti+2, ti−1 = ti+1) + I(ti−1 = ti = ti+1 = ti+2) + α n(ti,ti+1) + I(ti−2 = ti, ti−1 = ti+1) + I(ti−1 = ti = ti+1) + T α Figure 2: Conditional distribution for ti.

We varied the values of the hyperparameters α and β and evaluated overall tagging accuracy. For comparison with our Bayesian HMM (BHMM) in this and following sections, we also present results from the Viterbi decoding of an HMM trained using MLE by running EM to convergence (MLHMM). Where direct comparison is possible, we list the scores reported by Smith and Eisner (2005) for their conditional random field model trained using contrastive estimation (CRF/CE).2","For all experiments, we ran our Gibbs sampling algorithm for 20,000 iterations over the entire data set. The algorithm was initialized with a random tag assignment and a temperature of 2, and the temperature was gradually decreased to .08. Since our inference procedure is stochastic, our reported results are an average over 5 independent runs.","Results from our model for a range of hyperparameters are presented in Table 1. With the best choice of hyperparameters (α = .003, β = 1), we achieve average tagging accuracy of 86.8%.

The optimal value of .003 for α reflects the fact that the true transition probability matrix for this corpus is indeed sparse. As α grows larger, the model prefers more uniform transition probabilities, which causes it to perform worse. Although the true output distributions tend to be sparse as well, the level of sparseness depends on the tag (consider function words vs. content words in particular). Therefore, a value of β that accurately reflects the most probable output distributions for some tags may be a poor choice for other tags. This leads to the smaller effect of β, and suggests that performance might be improved by selecting a different β for each tag, as we do in the next section.","A final point worth noting is that even when α = β = 1 (i.e., the Dirichlet priors exert no influence) the BHMM still performs much better than the MLHMM. This result underscores the importance of integrating over model parameters: the BHMM identifies a sequence of tags that have high proba-748 bility over a range of parameter values, rather than choosing tags based on the single best set of parameters. The improved results of the BHMM demonstrate that selecting a sequence that is robust to variations in the parameters leads to better performance."]},{"title":"4 Hyperparameter Inference","paragraphs":["In our initial experiments, we experimented with different fixed values of the hyperparameters and reported results based on their optimal values. However, choosing hyperparameters in this way is timeconsuming at best and impossible at worst, if there is no gold standard available. Luckily, the Bayesian approach allows us to automatically select values for the hyperparameters by treating them as addi-tional variables in the model. We augment the model with priors over the hyperparameters (here, we assume an improper uniform prior), and use a single Metropolis-Hastings update (Gilks et al., 1996) to resample the value of each hyperparameter after each iteration of the Gibbs sampler. Informally, to update the value of hyperparameter α, we sample a proposed new value α′","from a normal distribution with μ = α and σ = .1α.

Hyperparameter inference leads to slightly lower scores than are obtained by oracle hyperparameter selection, but both versions of BHMM are still far superior to MLHMM for all corpus sizes. Not surprisingly, the advantages of BHMM are most pronounced on the smallest corpus: the effects of parameter integration and sensible priors are stronger when less evidence is available from the input. In the limit as corpus size goes to in-finity, the BHMM and MLHMM will make identical predictions. 5.2 Varying dictionary knowledge In unsupervised learning, it is not always reasonable to assume that a large tag dictionary is available. To determine the effects of reduced or absent dictionary information, we ran a set of experiments inspired by those of Smith and Eisner (2005). First, we collapsed the set of 45 treebank tags onto a smaller set of 17 (the same set used by Smith and Eisner). We created a full tag dictionary for this set of tags from the entire treebank, and also created several reduced dictionaries. Each reduced dictionary contains the tag information only for words that appear at least d times in the training corpus (the 24k corpus, for these experiments). All other words are fully ambiguous between all 17 classes. We ran tests with d = 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and ∞ (i.e., knowledge-free syntactic clustering).","With standard accuracy measures, it is difficult to 749","Value of d Accuracy 1 2 3 5 10 ∞ random 69.6 56.7 51.0 45.2 38.6 MLHMM 83.2 70.6 65.5 59.0 50.9 CRF/CE 90.4 77.0 71.7 BHMM1 86.0 76.4 71.0 64.3 58.0 BHMM2 87.3 79.6 65.0 59.2 49.7 σ < .2 .8 .6 .3 1.4 VI random 2.65 3.96 4.38 4.75 5.13 7.29 MLHMM 1.13 2.51 3.00 3.41 3.89 6.50 BHMM1 1.09 2.44 2.82 3.19 3.47 4.30 BHMM2 1.04 1.78 2.31 2.49 2.97 4.04 σ < .02 .03 .04 .03 .07 .17 Corpus stats % ambig. 49.0 61.3 66.3 70.9 75.8 100 tags/token 1.9 4.4 5.5 6.8 8.3 17 Table 3: Percentage of words tagged correctly and variation of information between clusterings induced by the assigned and gold standard tags as the amount of information in the dictionary is varied.

We therefore introduce another evaluation measure for these experiments, a distance metric on clusterings known as variation of information (Meilǎ, 2002). The variation of information (VI) between two clusterings C (the gold standard) and C′ (the found clustering) of a set of data points is a sum of the amount of information lost in moving from C to C′",", and the amount that must be gained. It is defined in terms of entropy H and mutual information I: V I(C, C′",") = H(C) + H(C′",") − 2I(C, C′","). Even when accuracy can be measured, VI may be more informative: two different tag assignments may have the same accuracy but different VI with respect to the gold standard if the errors in one assignment are less consistent than those in the other.","Table 3 gives the results for this set of experiments. One or both versions of BHMM outperform MLHMM in terms of tag accuracy for all values of d, although the differences are not as great as in earlier experiments. The differences in VI are more striking, particularly as the amount of dictionary information is reduced. When ambiguity is greater, both versions of BHMM show less confusion with respect to the true tags than does MLHMM, and BHMM2 performs the best in all circumstances. The confusion matrices in Figure 3 provide a more intuitive picture of the very different sorts of clusterings produced by MLHMM and BHMM2 when no tag dictionary is available. Similar differences hold to a lesser degree when a partial dictionary is provided. With MLHMM, different tokens of the same word type are usually assigned to the same cluster, but types are assigned to clusters more or less at random, and all clusters have approximately the same number of types (542 on average, with a standard deviation of 174). The clusters found by BHMM2 tend to be more coherent and more variable in size: in the 5 runs of BHMM2, the average number of types per cluster ranged from 436 to 465 (i.e., tokens of the same word are spread over fewer clusters than in MLHMM), with a standard deviation between 460 and 674. Determiners, prepositions, the possessive marker, and various kinds of punctuation are mostly clustered coherently. Nouns are spread over a few clusters, partly due to a distinction found between common and proper nouns. Likewise, modal verbs and the copula are mostly separated from other verbs. Errors are often sensible: adjectives and nouns are frequently confused, as are verbs and adverbs.","The kinds of results produced by BHMM1 and BHMM2 are more similar to each other than to the results of MLHMM, but the differences are still informative. Recall that BHMM1 learns a single value for β that is used for all output distributions, while BHMM2 learns separate hyperparameters for each cluster. This leads to different treat-ments of difficult-to-classify low-frequency items. In BHMM1, these items tend to be spread evenly among all clusters, so that all clusters have similarly sparse output distributions. In BHMM2, the system creates one or two clusters consisting entirely of very infrequent items, where the priors on these clusters strongly prefer uniform outputs, and all other clusters prefer extremely sparse outputs (and are more coherent than in BHMM1). This explains the difference in VI between the two systems, as well as the higher accuracy of BHMM1 for d ≥ 3: the single β discourages placing low-frequency items in their own cluster, so they are more likely to be clustered with items that have sim-750 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011121314151617","N","INPUNC ADJ","V DET PREP","ENDPUNC VBG CONJ VBN ADV TO WH PRT POS","LPUNC","RPUNC (a) BHMM2 Found Tags True Tags 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011121314151617","N","INPUNC ADJ","V DET PREP","ENDPUNC VBG CONJ VBN ADV TO WH PRT POS","LPUNC","RPUNC (b) MLHMM Found Tags True Tags Figure 3: Confusion matrices for the dictionary-free clusterings found by (a) BHMM2 and (b) MLHMM. ilar transition probabilities.

Integrating over possible parameter values leads to more robust solutions and allows the use of priors favoring sparse distributions. The Bayesian approach is particularly helpful when learning is less constrained, either because less data is available or because dictionary information is limited or absent. For knowledge-free clustering, our approach can also be extended through the use of infinite models so that the number of clusters need not be specified in advance.
