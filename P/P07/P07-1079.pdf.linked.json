Much of the appeal of these approaches is tied to the use of a simple formalism, which allows for the use of efficient parsing algorithms, as well as straightforward ways to train discriminative models to perform disambiguation. At the same time, there is growing interest in parsing with more sophisticated lexicalized grammar formalisms, such as Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Bresnan, 1982), Lexicalized Tree Adjoin-ing Grammar (LTAG) (Schabes et al., 1988), Headdriven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag, 1994) and Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000), which represent deep syntactic structures that cannot be expressed in a shallower formalism designed to represent only as-pects of surface syntax, such as the dependency formalism used in current mainstream dependency parsing.","We present a novel framework that combines strengths from surface syntactic parsing and deep syntactic parsing, specifically by combining dependency and HPSG parsing. We show that, by using surface dependencies to constrain the application of wide-coverage HPSG rules, we can benefit from a number of parsing techniques designed for high-accuracy dependency parsing, while actually performing deep syntactic analysis. From the point of view of HPSG parsing, accuracy can be improved significantly through the use of highly accurate discriminative dependency models, without the difficulties involved in adapting these models to a more complex and linguistically sophisticated formalism. In addition, improvements in dependency parsing accuracy are converted directly into improvements in HPSG parsing accuracy. From the point of view of dependency parsing, the application of HPSG rules to structures generated by a surface dependency model provides a principled and linguistically motivated way to identify deep syntactic phenomena, such as long-distance dependencies, raising and control.","We begin by describing our dependency and HPSG parsing approaches in section 2. In section 3, we present our framework for HPSG parsing with shallow dependency constraints, and in section 4 we 624 Figure 1: HPSG parsing evaluate this framework empirically. Sections 5 and 6 discuss related work and conclusions."]},{"title":"2 Fast dependency parsing and wide-coverage HPSG parsing 2.1 Data-driven dependency parsing","paragraphs":["Because we use dependency parsing as a step in deep parsing, it is important that we choose a parsing approach that is not only accurate, but also efficient. The deterministic shift/reduce classifier-based dependency parsing approach (Nivre and Scholz, 2004) has been shown to offer state-of-the-art accuracy (Nivre et al., 2006) with high efficiency due to a greedy search strategy. Our approach is based on Nivre and Scholz’s approach, using support vector machines for classification of shift/reduce actions. 2.2 Wide-coverage HPSG parsing HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) is a syntactic the-ory based on lexicalized grammar formalism. In HPSG, a small number of schemas explain general construction rules, and a large number of lexical entries express word-specific syntactic/semantic constraints. Figure 1 shows an example of the process of HPSG parsing. First, lexical entries are assigned to each word in a sentence. In Figure 1, lexical entries express subcategorization frames and predicate argument structures. Parsing proceeds by applying schemas to lexical entries. In this example, the Head-Complement Schema is applied to the lexical entries of “tried” and “running”. We then obtain a phrasal structure for “tried running”. By repeatedly applying schemas to lexical/phrasal structures, Figure 2: Extracting HPSG lexical entries from the Penn Treebank we finally obtain an HPSG parse tree that covers the entire sentence.","In this paper, we use an HPSG parser developed by Miyao and Tsujii (2005). This parser has a wide-coverage HPSG lexicon which is extracted from the Penn Treebank. Figure 2 illustrates their method for extraction of HPSG lexical entries. First, given a parse tree from the Penn Treebank (top), HPSG-style constraints are added and an HPSG-style parse tree is obtained (middle). Lexical entries are then extracted from the terminal nodes of the HPSG parse tree (bottom). This way, in addition to a wide-coverage lexicon, we also obtain an HPSG treebank, which can be used as training data for disambiguation models.","The disambiguation model of this parser is based on a maximum entropy model (Berger et al., 1996). The probability p(T |W ) of an HPSG parse tree T for the sentence W = ⟨w1, . . . , wn⟩ is given as: p(T |W ) = p(T |L, W )p(L|W ) = 1 Z exp ( ∑ i λifi(T ) ) ∏ j p(lj|W ), where L = ⟨l1, . . . , ln⟩ are lexical entries and 625 p(li|W ) is the supertagging probability, i.e., the probability of assignining the lexical entry li to wi (Ninomiya et al., 2006). The probability p(T |L, W ) is a maximum entropy model on HPSG parse trees, where Z is a normalization factor, and feature functions fi(T ) represent syntactic characteristics, such as head words, lengths of phrases, and applied schemas. Given the HPSG treebank as training data, the model parameters λi are estimated so as to maximize the log-likelihood of the training data (Malouf, 2002)."]},{"title":"3 HPSG parsing with dependency constraints","paragraphs":["While a number of fairly straightforward models can be applied successfully to dependency parsing, designing and training HPSG parsing models has been regarded as a significantly more complex task. Although it seems intuitive that a more sophisticated linguistic formalism should be more difficult to parameterize properly, we argue that the difference in complexity between HPSG and dependency structures can be seen as incremental, and that the use of accurate and efficient techniques to determine the surface dependency structure of a sentence provides valuable information that aids HPSG disambiguation. This is largely because HPSG is based on a lexicalized grammar formalism, and as such its syntactic structures have an underlying dependency backbone. However, HPSG syntactic structures includes long-distance dependencies, and the underlying dependency structure described by and HPSG structure is a directed acyclic graph, not a dependency tree (as used by mainstream approaches to data-driven dependency parsing). This difference manifests itself in words that have multiple heads. For example, in the sentence I tried to run, the pronoun I is a dependent of tried and of run. This makes it possible to represent that I is the subject of both verbs, precisely the kind of information that cannot be represented in dependency parsing. If we ignore long-distance dependencies, however, HPSG structures can be seen as lexicalized trees that can be easily converted into dependency trees.","Given that for an HPSG representation of the syntactic structure of a sentence we can determine a dependency tree by removing long-distance dependencies, we can use dependency parsing techniques (such as the deterministic dependency parsing approach mentioned in section 2.1) to determine the underlying dependency trees in HPSG structures. This is the basis for the parsing framework presented here. In this approach, deep dependency analysis is done in two stages. First, a dependency parser determines the shallow dependency tree for the input sentence. This shallow dependency tree corresponds to the underlying dependency graph of the HPSG structure for the input sentence, without dependencies that roughly correspond to deep syntax. The second step is to perform HPSG parsing, as described in section 2.2, but using the shallow dependency tree to constrain the application of HPSG rules. We now discuss these two steps in more detail.","3.1 Determining shallow dependencies in HPSG structures using dependency parsing In order to apply a data-driven dependency approach to the task of identifying the shallow dependency tree in HPSG structures, we first need a corpus of such dependency trees to serve as training data. We created a dependency training corpus based on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), or more specifically on the HPSG Treebank generated from the Penn Treebank (see section 2.2). For each HPSG structure in the HPSG Treebank, a dependency tree is extracted in two steps. First, the HPSG tree is converted into a CFG-style tree, simply by removing long-distance dependency links between nodes. A dependency tree is then extracted from the resulting lexicalized CFG-style tree, as is commonly done for converting constituent trees into dependency trees after the application of a head-percolation table (Collins, 1999).","Once a dependency training corpus is available, it is used to train a dependency parser as described in section 2.1. This is done by training a classifier to determine parser actions based on local features that represent the current state of the parser (Nivre and Scholz, 2004; Sagae and Lavie, 2005). Train-ing data for the classifier is obtained by applying the parsing algorithm over the training sentences (for which the correct dependency structures are known) and recording the appropriate parser actions that result in the formation of the correct dependency trees, coupled with the features that represent the state of 626 the parser mentioned in section 2.1. An evaluation of the resulting dependency parser and its efficacy in aiding HPSG parsing is presented in section 4. 3.2 Parsing with dependency constraints Given a set of dependencies, the bottom-up process of HPSG parsing can be constrained so that it does not violate the given dependencies. This can be achieved by a simple extension of the parsing algorithm, as follows. During parsing, we store the lexical head of each partial parse tree. In each schema application, we can determine which child is the head; for example, the left child is the head when we apply the Head-Complement Schema. Given this information and lexical heads, the parser can identify the dependency produced by this schema application, and can therefore judge whether the schema application violates the dependency constraints.","This method forces the HPSG parser to produce parse trees that strictly conform to the output of the dependency parser. However, this means that the HPSG parser outputs no successful parse results when it cannot find the parse tree that is completely consistent with the given dependencies. This situation may occur when the dependency parser produces structures that are not covered in the HPSG grammar. This is especially likely with a fully data-driven dependency parser that uses local classification, since its output may not be globally consistent grammatically. In addition, the HPSG grammar is extracted from the HPSG Treebank using a corpus-based procedure, and it does not necessarily cover all possible grammatical phenomena in unseen text (Miyao and Tsujii, 2005).","We therefore propose an extension of this approach that uses predetermined dependencies as soft constraints. Violations of schema applications are detected in the same way as before, but instead of strictly prohibiting schema applications, we penalize the log-likelihood of partial parse trees created by schema applications that violate the dependencies constraints. Given a negative value α, we add α to the log-probability of a partial parse tree when the schema application violates the dependency constraints. That is, when a parse tree violates n dependencies, the log-probability of the parse tree is low-ered by nα. The meta parameter α is determined so as to maximize the accuracy on the development set.","Soft dependency constraints can be implemented as explained above as a straightforward extension of the parsing algorithm. In addition, it is easily integrated with beam thresholding methods of parsing. Because beam thresholding discards partial parse trees that have low log-probabilities, we can expect that the parser would discard partial parse trees based on violation of the dependency constraints."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["We evaluate the accuracy of HPSG parsing with dependency constraints on the HPSG Treebank (Miyao et al., 2003), which is extracted from the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993)1",". Sections 02-21 were used for training (for HPSG and dependency parsers), section 22 was used as development data, and final testing was performed on section 23. Following previous work on wide-coverage parsing with lexicalized grammars using the Penn Treebank, we evaluate the parser by measuring the accuracy of predicate-argument relations in the parser’s output. A predicate-argument relation is defined as a tuple ⟨σ, wh, a, wa⟩, where σ is the predicate type (e.g. adjective, intransitive verb), wh is the head word of the predicate, a is the argument label (MODARG, ARG1, ... , ARG4), and wa is the head word of the argument. Labeled precision (LP)/labeled recall (LR) is the ratio of tuples correctly identified by the parser. These predicate-argument relations cover the full range of syntactic dependencies produced by the HPSG parser (includ-ing, long-distance dependencies, raising and control, in addition to surface dependencies).","In the experiments presented in this section, input sentences were automatically tagged with parts-of-speech with about 97% accuracy, using a maximum entropy POS tagger. We also report results on parsing text with gold standard POS tags, where explicitly noted. This provides an upper-bound on what can be expected if a more sophisticated multitagging scheme (James R. Curran and Vadas, 2006) is used, instead of hard assignment of single tags in a preprocessing step as done here. 1 The extraction software can be obtained from http://www-","tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/enju. 627 4.1 Baseline HPSG parsing results using the same HPSG grammar and treebank have recently been reported by Miyao and Tsujii (2005) and Ninomia et al. (2006). By running the HPSG parser described in section 2.2 on the development data without dependency constraints, we obtain similar values of LP (86.8%) and LR (85.6%) as those reported by Miyao and Tsujii (Miyao and Tsujii, 2005). Using the extremely lexicalized framework of (Ninomiya et al., 2006) by performing supertagging before parsing, we obtain similar accuracy as Ninomiya et al. (87.1% LP and 85.9% LR).","4.2 Dependency constraints and the penalty parameter Parsing the development data with hard dependency constraints confirmed the intuition that these constraints often describe dependency structures that do not conform to HPSG schema used in parsing, resulting in parse failures. To determine the upper-bound on HPSG parsing with hard dependency constraints, we set the HPSG parser to disallow the application of any rules that result in the creation of dependencies that violate gold standard dependencies. This results in high precision (96.7%), but recall is low (82.3%) due to parse failures caused by lack of grammatical coverage 2",". Using dependencies produced by the shift-reduce SVM parser, we obtain 91.5% LP and 65.7% LR. This represents a large gain in precision over the baseline, but an even greater loss in recall, which limits the usefulness of the parser, and severely hurts the appeal of hard constraints.","We focus the rest of our experiments on parsing with soft dependency constraints. As explained in section 3, this involves setting the penalty parameter α. During parsing, we subtract α from the log-probability of applying any schema that violates the dependency constraints given to the HPSG parser. Figure 3 illustrates the effect of α when gold standard dependencies (and gold standard POS tags) are used. We note that setting α = 0 causes the parser","2","Although the HPSG grammar does not have perfect coverage of unseen text, it supports complete and mostly correct analyses for all sentences in the development set. However, when we require completely correct analyses by using hard constraints, lack of coverage may cause parse failures. 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96","0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Penalty A c c u r a c y","Precision","Recall","F-score Figure 3: The effect of α on HPSG parsing constrained by gold standard dependencies. to ignore dependency constraints, providing baseline performance. Conversely, setting a high enough value (α = 30 is sufficient, in practice) causes any substructures that violate the dependency constraints to be used only when they are absolutely necessary to produce a valid parse for the input sentence. In figure 3, this corresponds to an upper-bound on the accuracy of parsing with soft dependency constraints (94.7% f-score), since gold standard dependencies are used.","We set α empirically with simple hill climbing on the development set. Because it is expected that the optimal value of α depends on the accuracy of the surface dependency parser, we set separate values for parsing with a POS tagger or with gold standard POS tags. Figure 4 shows the accuracy of HPSG predicate-argument relations obtained with dependency constraints determined by dependency parsing with gold standard POS tags. With both automatically assigned and gold standard POS tags, we observe an improvement of about 0.6% in precision, recall and f-score, when the optimal α value is used in each case. While this corresponds to a relative error reduction of over 6% (or 12%, if we consider the upper-bound dictated by imperfect grammatical coverage), a more interesting aspect of this framework is that it allows techniques designed for improving dependency accuracy to improve HPSG parsing accuracy directly, as we illustrate next. 628 89.4 89.6 89.8 90 90.2 90.4 90.6 90.8 91","0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 Penalty A c c u r a c y","Precision","Recall","F-score Figure 4: The effect of α on HPSG parsing constrained by the output of a dependency parser using gold standard POS tags.","4.3 Determining constraints with dependency parser combination Parser combination has been shown to be a powerful way to obtain very high accuracy in dependency parsing (Sagae and Lavie, 2006). Using dependency constraints allows us to improve HPSG parsing accuracy simply by using an existing parser combination approach. As a first step, we train two additional parsers with the dependencies extracted from the HPSG Treebank. The first uses the same shift-reduce framework described in section 2.1, but it process the input from right to left (RL). This has been found to work well in previous work on dependency parser combination (Zeman and Žabokrtský, 2005; Sagae and Lavie, 2006). The second parser is MSTParser, the large-margin maximum spanning tree parser described in (McDonald et al., 2005)3",".","We examine the use of two combination schemes: one using two parsers, and one using three parsers. The first combination approach is to keep only dependencies for which there is agreement between the two parsers. In other words, dependencies that are proposed by one parser but not the other are simply discarded. Using the left-to-right shift-reduce parser and MSTParser, we find that this results in very high precision of surface dependencies on the development data. In the second approach, combination of 3 Downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mstparser the three dependency parsers is done according to the maximum spanning tree combination scheme of Sagae and Lavie (2006), which results in high accuracy of surface dependencies. For each of the combination approaches, we use the resulting dependencies as constraints for HPSG parsing, determining the optimal value of α on the development set in the same way as done for a single parser. Table 1 summarizes our experiments on development data using parser combinations to produce dependency constraints 4",". The two combination approaches are denoted as C1 and C2.

Our final results are shown in table 2, where we also include the results published in (Ninomiya et al., 2006) for comparison purposes, and the result of using dependency constraints obtained with gold standard POS tags.","By using two unlabeled dependency parsers to provide soft dependency constraints, we obtain a 1% absolute improvement in precision and recall of predicate-argument identification in HPSG parsing over a strong baseline.

It is interesting to note that the results obtained with dependency parser combinations C1 and C2 were very similar, even though in C1 only two parsers were used, and constraints were provided for about 92% of shallow dependencies (with accuracy higher than 96%). Clearly, precision is crucial in dependency constraints.","Finally, although it is necessary to perform dependency parsing to pre-compute dependency constraints, the total time required to perform the entire process of HPSG parsing with dependency constraints is close to that of the baseline HPSG approach. This is due to two reasons: (1) the dependency parsing approaches used to pre-compute constraints are several times faster than the baseline HPSG approach, and (2) the HPSG portion of the process is significantly faster when dependency constraints are used, since the constraints help sharpen the search space, making search more efficient. Using the baseline HPSG approach, it takes approximately 25 minutes to parse the test set. The total time required to parse the test set using HPSG with dependency constraints generated by the shift-reduce parser is 27 minutes. With combination C1, parsing time increases to 30 minutes, since two dependency parsers are used sequentially."]},{"title":"5 Related work","paragraphs":["There are other approaches that combine shallow processing with deep parsing (Crysmann et al., 2002; Frank et al., 2003; Daum et al., 2003) to improve parsing efficiency.
