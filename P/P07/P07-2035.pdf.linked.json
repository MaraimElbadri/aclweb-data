For example, ","home run is associated with the domain SPORTS2",". That is, we aim to make explicit the horizontal relation between words, the domain relation, while thesauri indicate the vertical relation called IS-A.3 1 In fact, there have been a few domain resources in Japanese","like Yoshimoto et al. (1997). But they are not publicly available. 2 Domains are CAPITALIZED in this paper. 3 The lack of the horizontal relationship is also known as the","“tennis problem” (Fellbaum, 1998, p.10)."]},{"title":"2 Two Issues","paragraphs":["You have to address two issues. One is what domains to assume, and the other is how to associate words with domains without document collections.","The former is paraphrased as how people categorize the real world, which is really a hard problem. In this study, we avoid being too involved in the problem and adopt a simple domain system that most people can agree on, which is as follows: CULTURE RECREATION SPORTS HEALTH LIVING DIET TRANSPORTATION EDUCATION SCIENCE BUSINESS MEDIA GOVERNMENT","It has been created based on web directories such as Open Directory Project with some adjustments. In addition, NODOMAIN was prepared for those words that do not belong to any particular domain.","As for the latter issue, you might use keyword extraction techniques; identifying words that represent a domain from the document collection using statistical measures like TF*IDF and matching between extracted words and JFWs. However, you will find that document collections of common domains such as those assumed here are hard to obtain.4","Hence, we had to develop a method that does not require document collections. The next section details it.","4","Initially, we tried collecting web pages in Yahoo! JAPAN. However, we found that most of them were index pages with a few text contents, from which you cannot extract reliable keywords. Though we further tried following links in those index pages to acquire enough texts, extracted words turned out to be site-specific rather than domain-specific since many pages were collected from a particular web site. 137 Table 1: Examples of Keywords for each Domain","Domain Examples of Keywords","CULTURE movie,","music","RECREATION tourism,","firework","SPORTS player,","baseball","HEALTH surgery,","diagnosis","LIVING childcare,","furniture","DIET","chopsticks,","lunch","TRANSPORTATION","station,","road","EDUCATION teacher,","arithmetic","SCIENCE research,","theory","BUSINESS import,","market","MEDIA broadcast,","reporter","GOVERNMENT judicatory,","tax"]},{"title":"3 Domain Dictionary Construction","paragraphs":["To identify which domain a JFW is associated with, we use manually-prepared keywords for each domain rather than document collections. The construction process is as follows: 1 Preparing keywords for each domain (§3.1). 2 Associating JFWs with domains (§3.2). 3 Reassociating JFWs with NODOMAIN (§3.3). 4 Manual correction (§3.5). 3.1 Preparing Keywords for each Domain About 20 keywords for each domain were collected manually from words that appear most frequently in the Web. Table 1 shows examples of the keywords. 3.2 Associating JFWs with Domains A JFW is associated with a domain of the highest Ad score. An Ad score of domain is calculated by summing up the top five Ak scores of the domain. Then, an Ak score, which is definedbetween a JFW and a keyword of a domain, is a measure that shows how strongly the JFW and the keyword are related (Figure 1). Assuming that two words are related if they cooccur more often than chance in a corpus, we adopt the χ2","statistics to calculate an A","k score and use web pages as a corpus. The number of co-occurrences is approximated by the number of search engine hits when the two words are used as queries. Among various alternatives, the combina-tion of the χ2","statistics and web pages is adopted following Sasaki et al. (2006).","Based on Sasaki et al. (2006), Ak score between JFWs JFW1 JFW2 JFW3 · · ·","DOMAIN1 kw1a kw1b · · ·","DOMAIN2 kw2a kw2b · · · · · · Ad score JFWm","kwna kwnb · · · DOMAINn Ak scores Figure 1: Associating JFWs with Domains a JFW (jw) and a keyword (kw) is given as below. Ak(jw, kw) =","n(ad − bc)2 (a + b)(c + d)(a + c)(b + d) where n is the total number of Japanese web pages, a = hits(jw & kw), b = hits(jw) − a, c = hits(kw) − a, d = n − (a + b + c). Note that hits(q) represents the number of search engine hits when q is used as a query. 3.3 Reassociating JFWs with NODOMAIN JFWs that do not belong to any particular domain, i.e. whose highest Ad score is low should be re-associated with NODOMAIN. Thus, a threshold for determining if a JFW’s highest Ad score is low is required. The threshold for a JFW (jw) needs to be changed according to hits(jw); the greater hits(jw) is, the higher the threshold should be.","To establish a function that takes jw and returns the appropriate threshold for it, the following semiautomatic process is required after all JFWs are associated with domains: (i) Sort all tuples of the form < jw, hits(jw), the highest Ad of the jw > by hits(jw).5","(ii) Segment the tuples. (iii) For each segment, extract manually tuples whose jw should be associated with one of the 12 domains and those whose jw should be deemed as NODOMAIN. Note that the former tuples usually have higher Ad scores than the latter tuples. (iv) For each segment, identify a threshold that distinguishes between the former tuples and the latter tuples by their Ad scores. At this point, pairs of the number of hits (represented by each segment) and the appropriate threshold for it are obtained. (v) Approximate the relation between","5","Note that we acquire the number of search engine hits and the Ad score for each jw in the process 2 . 138 the number of hits and its threshold by a linear function using least-square method. Finally, this function indicates the appropriate threshold for each jw. 3.4 Performance of the Proposed Method We applied the method to JFWs installed on JU-MAN (Kurohashi et al., 1994), which are 26,658 words consisting of commonly used nouns and verbs. As an evaluation, we sampled 380 pairs of a JFW and its domain, and measured accuracy.6","As a result, the proposed method attained the accuracy of 81.3% (309/380). 3.5 Manual Correction Our policy is that simpler is better. Thus, as one of our guidelines for manual correction, we avoid associating a JFW with multiple domains as far as possible. JFWs to associate with multiple domains are restricted to those that are EQUALLY relevant to more than one domain."]},{"title":"4 Blog Categorization","paragraphs":["As a task-based evaluation, we categorized blog articles into the domains assumed here. 4.1 Categorization Method (i) Extract JFWs from the article. (ii) Classify the extracted JFWs into the domains using the domain dictionary. (iii) Sort the domains by the number of JFWs classifiedin descending order. (iv) Categorize the article as the top domain. If the top domain is NODOMAIN, the article is categorized as the second domain under the condition below. |W (2ND DOMAIN)| ÷ |W (NODOMAIN)| > 0.03 where |W (D)| is the number of JFWs classifiedinto the domain D. 4.2 Data We prepared two blog collections; Bcontrolled and Brandom.

The former brought about the poor accuracy for MEDIA. That is, some words of MEDIA are often used in other contexts. For example,","live coverage is often used in the SPORTS context. On the other hand, the method worked poorly for RECREATION and LIVING for the latter reason; the method exploits the Web. Namely, some words of the domains, such as","tourism and  ","","shampoo, are often used in the web sites of companies (BUSINESS) that provide services or goods related to RECREATION or LIVING. As a result, the method tends to wrongly associate those words with BUSINESS."]},{"title":"6 Related Work","paragraphs":["HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2006) and WordNet provide domain information for Chinese and English, but there has been no domain resource for Japanese that are publicly available.8","Domain dictionary construction methods that have been developed so far are all based on highly structured lexical resources like LDOCE or WordNet (Guthrie et al., 1991; Agirre et al., 2001) and hence not applicable to languages for which such highly structured lexical resources are not available.","Accordingly, contributions of this study are twofold: (i) We constructed the first Japanese domain dictionary that is fully available.
