Discriminatively trained models based on local character features are used to make the tagging decisions, with Viterbi decoding finding the highest scoring segmentation. In this paper we propose an alternative, word-based segmentor, which uses features based on complete words and word sequences. The generalized perceptron algorithm is used for discriminative training, and we use a beam-search decoder. Closed tests on the first and second SIGHAN bakeoffs show that our system is competitive with the best in the literature, achieving the highest reported F-scores for a number of corpora."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Words are the basic units to process for most NLP tasks. The problem of Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is to find these basic units for a given sentence, which is written as a continuous sequence of characters. It is the initial step for most Chinese processing applications.","Chinese character sequences are ambiguous, often requiring knowledge from a variety of sources for disambiguation. Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are a major source of ambiguity. For example, a difficult case occurs when an OOV word consists","of characters which have themselves been seen as","words; here an automatic segmentor may split the","OOV word into individual single-character words.","Typical examples of unseen words include Chinese","names, translated foreign names and idioms.","The segmentation of known words can also be","ambiguous. For example, “","","","” should be “"," (here)","(flour)” in the sentence “","","","","","","","” (flour and rice are expensive here) or “","(here)",""," (inside)” in the sentence “","","","","","” (it’s","cold inside here). The ambiguity can be resolved","with information about the neighboring words. In","comparison, for the sentences “","","","","","","”,","possible segmentations include “","","(the discus-","sion)","(will)","(very)","","(be successful)” and","“  ","(the discussion meeting)","(very)","","(be","successful)”. The ambiguity can only be resolved","with contextual information outside the sentence.","Human readers often use semantics, contextual in-","formation about the document and world knowledge","to resolve segmentation ambiguities.","There is no fixed standard for Chinese word seg-","mentation. Experiments have shown that there is","only about 75% agreement among native speakers","regarding the correct word segmentation (Sproat et","al., 1996). Also, specific NLP tasks may require dif-","ferent segmentation criteria. For example, “","","","","” could be treated as a single word (Bank of Bei-","jing) for machine translation, while it is more natu-","rally segmented into “","","(Beijing)","","(bank)”","for tasks such as text-to-speech synthesis. There-","fore, supervised learning with specifically defined","training data has become the dominant approach.","Following Xue (2003), the standard approach to 840 supervised learning for CWS is to treat it as a tagging task. Tags are assigned to each character in the sentence, indicating whether the character is a single-character word or the start, middle or end of a multi-character word. The features are usually confined to a five-character window with the current character in the middle. In this way, dynamic programming algorithms such as the Viterbi algorithm can be used for decoding.","Several discriminatively trained models have recently been applied to the CWS problem. Examples include Xue (2003), Peng et al. (2004) and Shi and Wang (2007); these use maximum entropy (ME) and conditional random field (CRF) models (Ratnaparkhi, 1998; Lafferty et al., 2001). An advantage of these models is their flexibility in allowing knowledge from various sources to be encoded as features.","Contextual information plays an important role in word segmentation decisions; especially useful is information about surrounding words. Consider the sentence “","","","","","”, which can be from “"," (among which)","","(foreign)","","(companies)”, or “","","(in China)","","(foreign companies) ","(business)”. Note that the five-character window surrounding “","” is the same in both cases, making the tagging decision for that character difficult given the local window. However, the correct decision can be made by comparison of the two three-word windows containing this character.","In order to explore the potential of word-based models, we adapt the perceptron discriminative learning algorithm to the CWS problem. Collins (2002) proposed the perceptron as an alternative to the CRF method for HMM-style taggers. However, our model does not map the segmentation problem to a tag sequence learning problem, but defines features on segmented sentences directly. Hence we use a beam-search decoder during training and testing; our idea is similar to that of Collins and Roark (2004) who used a beam-search decoder as part of a perceptron parsing model. Our work can also be seen as part of the recent move towards search-based learning methods which do not rely on dynamic programming and are thus able to exploit larger parts of the context for making decisions (Daume III, 2006).","We study several factors that influence the performance of the perceptron word segmentor, including the averaged perceptron method, the size of the beam and the importance of word-based features. We compare the accuracy of our final system to the state-of-the-art CWS systems in the literature using the first and second SIGHAN bakeoff data. Our system is competitive with the best systems, obtaining the highest reported F-scores on a number of the bakeoff corpora. These results demonstrate the importance of word-based features for CWS. Furthermore, our approach provides an example of the potential of search-based discriminative training methods for NLP tasks."]},{"title":"2 The Perceptron Training Algorithm","paragraphs":["We formulate the CWS problem as finding a mapping from an input sentence x ∈ X to an output sentence y ∈ Y , where X is the set of possible raw sentences and Y is the set of possible segmented sentences. Given an input sentence x, the correct output segmentation F (x) satisfies:","F (x) = arg max y∈GEN(x) Score(y) where GEN(x) denotes the set of possible segmentations for an input sentence x, consistent with notation from Collins (2002).","The score for a segmented sentence is computed by first mapping it into a set of features. A feature is an indicator of the occurrence of a certain pattern in a segmented sentence. For example, it can be the occurrence of “","","” as a single word, or the occurrence of “","” separated from “","” in two adjacent words. By defining features, a segmented sentence is mapped into a global feature vector, in which each dimension represents the count of a particular feature in the sentence. The term “global” feature vector is used by Collins (2002) to distinguish between feature count vectors for whole sequences and the “local” feature vectors in ME tagging models, which are Boolean valued vectors containing the indicator features for one element in the sequence.","Denote the global feature vector for segmented sentence y with Φ(y) ∈ Rd",", where d is the total number of features in the model; then Score(y) is computed by the dot product of vector Φ(y) and a parameter vector α ∈ Rd",", where αi is the weight for the ith feature: Score(y) = Φ(y) · α 841 Inputs: training examples (xi, yi) Initialization: set α = 0 Algorithm: for t = 1..T , i = 1..N","calculate zi = arg maxy∈GEN(xi) Φ(y) · α","if zi ̸= yi","α = α + Φ(yi) − Φ(zi) Outputs: α Figure 1: the perceptron learning algorithm, adapted from Collins (2002) The perceptron training algorithm is used to determine the weight values α.","The training algorithm initializes the parameter vector as all zeros, and updates the vector by decoding the training examples. Each training sentence is turned into the raw input form, and then decoded with the current parameter vector. The output segmented sentence is compared with the original training example. If the output is incorrect, the parameter vector is updated by adding the global feature vector of the training example and subtracting the global feature vector of the decoder output. The algorithm can perform multiple passes over the same training sentences. Figure 1 gives the algorithm, where N is the number of training sentences and T is the number of passes over the data.","Note that the algorithm from Collins (2002) was designed for discriminatively training an HMM-style tagger. Features are extracted from an input sequence x and its corresponding tag sequence y: Score(x, y) = Φ(x, y) · α Our algorithm is not based on an HMM. For a given input sequence x, even the length of different candidates y (the number of words) is not fixed. Because the output sequence y (the segmented sentence) contains all the information from the input sequence x (the raw sentence), the global feature vector Φ(x, y) is replaced with Φ(y), which is extracted from the candidate segmented sentences directly.","Despite the above differences, since the theorems of convergence and their proof (Collins, 2002) are only dependent on the feature vectors, and not on the source of the feature definitions, the perceptron algorithm is applicable to the training of our CWS model. 2.1 The averaged perceptron The averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002) was proposed as a way of reducing overfitting on the training data. It was motivated by the voted-perceptron algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1999) and has been shown to give improved accuracy over the non-averaged perceptron on a number of tasks. Let N be the number of training sentences, T the number of training iterations, and αn,t","the parameter vector immediately after the nth sentence in the tth iteration. The averaged parameter vector γ ∈ Rd is defined as: γ = 1 N T ∑ n=1..N,t=1..T αn,t","To compute the averaged parameters γ, the training algorithm in Figure 1 can be modified by keeping a total parameter vector σn,t","= ∑","αn,t",", which is updated using α after each training example. After the final iteration, γ is computed as σn,t","/N T . In the averaged perceptron algorithm, γ is used instead of α as the final parameter vector.","With a large number of features, calculating the total parameter vector σn,t","after each training example is expensive. Since the number of changed dimensions in the parameter vector α after each training example is a small proportion of the total vector, we use a lazy update optimization for the training process.1","Define an update vector τ to record the number of the training sentence n and iteration t when each dimension of the averaged parameter vector was last updated. Then after each training sentence is processed, only update the dimensions of the total parameter vector corresponding to the features in the sentence. (Except for the last example in the last iteration, when each dimension of τ is updated, no matter whether the decoder output is correct or not).","Denote the sth dimension in each vector before processing the nth example in the tth iteration as α n−1,t s , σ n−1,t s and τ","n−1,t","s = (nτ,s, tτ,s). Suppose","that the decoder output zn,t is different from the","training example yn. Now α n,t s , σ n,t s and τ n,t s can 1 Daume III (2006) describes a similar algorithm. 842 be updated in the following way:","σn,t","s = σn−1,t","s + αn−1,t","s × (tN +n −tτ,sN − nτ,s) αn,t s = αn−1,t","s + Φ(yn) − Φ(zn,t) σn,t s = σn,t","s + Φ(yn) − Φ(zn,t) τ n,t s = (n, t)","We found that this lazy update method was significantly faster than the naive method."]},{"title":"3 The Beam-Search Decoder","paragraphs":["The decoder reads characters from the input sentence one at a time, and generates candidate segmentations incrementally. At each stage, the next in-coming character is combined with an existing candidate in two different ways to generate new candidates: it is either appended to the last word in the candidate, or taken as the start of a new word. This method guarantees exhaustive generation of possible segmentations for any input sentence.","Two agendas are used: the source agenda and the target agenda. Initially the source agenda contains an empty sentence and the target agenda is empty. At each processing stage, the decoder reads in a character from the input sentence, combines it with each candidate in the source agenda and puts the generated candidates onto the target agenda. After each character is processed, the items in the target agenda are copied to the source agenda, and then the target agenda is cleaned, so that the newly generated candidates can be combined with the next incom-ing character to generate new candidates. After the last character is processed, the decoder returns the candidate with the best score in the source agenda. Figure 2 gives the decoding algorithm.","For a sentence with length l, there are 2l−1","different possible segmentations. To guarantee reasonable running speed, the size of the target agenda is limited, keeping only the B best candidates."]},{"title":"4 Feature templates","paragraphs":["The feature templates are shown in Table 1. Features 1 and 2 contain only word information, 3 to 5 contain character and length information, 6 and 7 contain only character information, 8 to 12 contain word and character information, while 13 and 14 contain","Input: raw sentence sent – a list of characters","Initialization: set agendas src = [[]], tgt = []","Variables: candidate sentence item – a list of words","Algorithm:","for index = 0..sent.length−1: var char = sent[index] foreach item in src:","// append as a new word to the candidate","var item1 = item","item1.append(char.toWord())","tgt.insert(item1)","// append the character to the last word","if item.length > 1:","var item2 = item","item2[item2.length−1].append(char)","tgt.insert(item2) src = tgt tgt = []","Outputs: src.best item Figure 2: The decoding algorithm word and length information. Any segmented sentence is mapped to a global feature vector according to these templates. There are 356, 337 features with non-zero values after 6 training iterations using the development data.","For this particular feature set, the longest range features are word bigrams. Therefore, among partial candidates ending with the same bigram, the best one will also be in the best final candidate. The decoder can be optimized accordingly: when an in-coming character is combined with candidate items as a new word, only the best candidate is kept among those having the same last word."]},{"title":"5 Comparison with Previous Work","paragraphs":["Among the character-tagging CWS models, Li et al. (2005) uses an uneven margin alteration of the traditional perceptron classifier (Li et al., 2002). Each character is classified independently, using information in the neighboring five-character window. Liang (2005) uses the discriminative perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002) to score whole character tag sequences, finding the best candidate by the global score. It can be seen as an alternative to the ME and CRF models (Xue, 2003; Peng et al., 2004), which 843 1 word w 2 word bigram w1w2 3 single-character word w 4 a word starting with character c and having","length l 5 a word ending with character c and having","length l 6 space-separated characters c1 and c2 7 character bigram c1c2 in any word 8 the first and last characters c1 and c2 of any","word 9 word w immediately before character c 10 character c immediately before word w 11 the starting characters c1 and c2 of two con-","secutive words 12 the ending characters c1 and c2 of two con-","secutive words 13 a word of length l and the previous word w 14 a word of length l and the next word w Table 1: feature templates do not involve word information. Wang et al. (2006) incorporates an N-gram language model in ME tagging, making use of word information to improve the character tagging model. The key difference between our model and the above models is the word-based nature of our system.","One existing method that is based on sub-word information, Zhang et al. (2006), combines a CRF and a rule-based model. Unlike the character-tagging models, the CRF submodel assigns tags to sub-words, which include single-character words and the most frequent multiple-character words from the training corpus. Thus it can be seen as a step towards a word-based model. However, sub-words do not necessarily contain full word information. More-over, sub-word extraction is performed separately from feature extraction. Another difference from our model is the rule-based submodel, which uses a dictionary-based forward maximum match method described by Sproat et al. (1996)."]},{"title":"6 Experiments","paragraphs":["Two sets of experiments were conducted. The first, used for development, was based on the part of Chinese Treebank 4 that is not in Chinese Treebank 3 (since CTB3 was used as part of the first bakeoff). This corpus contains 240K characters (150K words and 4798 sentences). 80% of the sentences (3813) were randomly chosen for training and the rest (985 sentences) were used as development testing data. The accuracies and learning curves for the non-averaged and averaged perceptron were compared. The influence of particular features and the agenda size were also studied.","The second set of experiments used training and testing sets from the first and second international Chinese word segmentation bakeoffs (Sproat and Emerson, 2003; Emerson, 2005). The accuracies are compared to other models in the literature.","F-measure is used as the accuracy measure. Define precision p as the percentage of words in the decoder output that are segmented correctly, and recall r as the percentage of gold standard output words that are correctly segmented by the decoder. The (balanced) F-measure is 2pr/(p + r).","CWS systems are evaluated by two types of tests. The closed tests require that the system is trained only with a designated training corpus. Any extra knowledge is not allowed, including common surnames, Chinese and Arabic numbers, European letters, lexicons, part-of-speech, semantics and so on. The open tests do not impose such restrictions.","Open tests measure a model’s capability to utilize extra information and domain knowledge, which can lead to improved performance, but since this extra information is not standardized, direct comparison between open test results is less informative.","In this paper, we focus only on the closed test. However, the perceptron model allows a wide range of features, and so future work will consider how to integrate open resources into our system. 6.1 Learning curve In this experiment, the agenda size was set to 16, for both training and testing.

The learning curve was used to fix the number of training iterations at 6 for the remaining experiments. 6.2 The influence of agenda size Reducing the agenda size increases the decoding speed, but it could cause loss of accuracy by eliminating potentially good candidates. The agenda size also affects the training time, and resulting model, since the perceptron training algorithm uses the decoder output to adjust the model parameters. Table 3 shows the accuracies with ten different agenda sizes, each used for both training and testing.","Accuracy does not increase beyond B = 16. Moreover, the accuracy is quite competitive even with B as low as 4.

Most of the features in Table 1 are related to words. Table 4 shows the accuracy with various features from the model removed.","Among the features, vocabulary words (feature 1) and length prediction by characters (features 3 to 5) showed strong influence on the accuracy, while word bigrams (feature 2) and special characters in them (features 11 and 12) showed comparatively weak influence. 2","The optimization in Section 4, which has a pruning effect, was applied to this experiment.

This model is an alternative to the existing character-based tagging models, and allows word information to be used as features. One attractive feature of the perceptron training algorithm is its simplicity, consisting of only a decoder and a trivial update process. We use a beam-search decoder, which places our work in the context of recent proposals for search-based discriminative learning algorithms. Closed tests using the first and second SIGHAN CWS bakeoff data demonstrated our system to be competitive with the best in the literature.","Open features, such as knowledge of numbers and European letters, and relationships from semantic networks (Shi and Wang, 2007), have been reported to improve accuracy. Therefore, given the flexibility of the feature-based perceptron model, an obvious next step is the study of open features in the segmentor.","Also, we wish to explore the possibility of in-corporating POS tagging and parsing features into the discriminative model, leading to joint decoding. The advantage is two-fold: higher level syntactic information can be used in word segmentation, while joint decoding helps to prevent bottomup error propagation among the different processing steps."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work is supported by the ORS and Clarendon Fund.
