Besides identifying the task it-self, it is crucial to determine the owner, or person responsible. Occasionally, the name of the responsible party is mentioned explicitly. More usually, the owner is addressed directly and therefore referred to using a second-person pronoun, as in example (1).1 (1)","A: and um if you can get that binding point also","maybe with a nice example that would be helpful","for Johno and me.","B: Oh yeah uh O K.","It can also be important to distinguish between singular and plural reference, as in example (2) where the task is assigned to more than one person: (2) A: So y- so you guys will send to the rest of us um a","version of um, this, and - the - uh, description - B: With sugge- yeah, suggested improvements and - Use of “you” might therefore help us both in de- ∗∗","This work was supported by the CALO project","(DARPA grant NBCH-D-03-0010) and ONR (MURI award","N000140510388).

While there is an increas-ing body of work concerning addressee identification (Katzenmaier et al., 2004; Jovanovic et al., 2006), there is very little investigating the problem of second-person pronoun resolution, and it is this that we address here. Most cases of “you” do not in fact refer to the addressee but are generic, as in example (3); automatic referentiality classification is therefore very important. (3)","B: Well, usually what you do is just wait until you think it’s stopped, and then you patch them up."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Previous linguistic work has recognized that “you” is not always addressee-referring, differentiating between generic and referential uses (Holmes, 1998; Meyers, 1990) as well as idiomatic cases of “you know” . For example, (Jurafsky et al., 2002) found that “you know” covered 47% of cases, the referential class 22%, and the generic class 27%, with no significant differences in surface form (duration or vowel reduction) between the different cases.","While there seems to be no previous work investigating automatic classification, there is related work on classifying “it” , which also takes various referential and non-referential readings: (M üller, 2006) use lexical and syntactic features in a rule-based classifier to detect non-referential uses, achieving raw accuracies around 74-80% and F-scores 63-69%."]},{"title":"3 Data","paragraphs":["We used the Switchboard corpus of two-party telephone conversations (Godfrey et al., 1992), and annotated the data with four classes: generic, referential singular, referential plural and a reported referential class, for mention in reported speech of an 105","Training Testing","Generic 360 79","Referential singular 287 92","Referential plural 17 3","Reported referential 5 1 Ambiguous 4 1","Total 673 176 Table 1: Number of cases found. originally referential use (as the original addressee may not be the current addressee – see example (4)).

Different labelers annotated the training and test sets; none of the authors were involved in labeling the test set.

Features fell into four main categories:2","sentential features which capture lexical features of the utterance itself; part-of-speech features which capture shallow syntactic patterns; dialog act features capturing the discourse function of the current utterance and surrounding context; and context features which give oracle information (i.e., the correct generic/referential label) about preceding uses","2","Currently, features are all based on perfect transcriptions. of “you” . We also investigated using the presence of a question mark in the transcription as a feature, as a possible replacement for some dialog act features. Table 2 presents our features in detail.

We therefore decided to model our problem as a two way classification task, predicting generic versus referential (collapsing referential singular and plural as one category). Note that we expect this to be the major useful distinction for our overall action-item detection task. Baseline A simple baseline involves predicting the dominant class (in the test set, referential). This gives 54.59% accuracy (see Table 1).3 SVM Results We used LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001), a support vector machine classifier trained using an RBF kernel. Table 3 presents results for 3 Precision and recall are of course 54.59% and 100%. 106 Features Accuracy F-Score Ctxt 45.66% 0% Baseline 54.59% 70.63% Sent 67.05% 57.14% Sent + Ctxt + POS 67.05% 57.14% Sent + Ctxt + POS + QM 76.30% 72.84% Sent + Ctxt + POS + Q DA 79.19% 77.50% DA 80.92% 79.75% Sent + Ctxt + POS + QM + DA 84.39% 84.21% Table 3: SVM results: generic versus referential various selected sets of features. The best set of features gave accuracy of 84.39% and f-score 84.21%. Discussion Overall performance is respectable; precision was consistently high (94% for the highest-accuracy result). Perhaps surprisingly, none of the context or part-of-speech features were found to be useful; however, dialog act features proved very useful – using these features alone give us an accuracy of 80.92% – with the referential class strongly associated with question dialog acts.","We used manually produced dialog act tags, and automatic labeling accuracy with this fine-grained tagset will be low; we would therefore prefer to use more robust features if possible. We found that one such heuristic feature, the presence of question mark, cannot entirely substitute: accuracy is reduced to 76.3%. However, using only the binary Q DA feature (which clusters together all the different kinds of question DAs) does better (79.19%). Although worse than performance with a full tagset, this gives hope that using a coarse-grained set of tags might allow reasonable results. As (Stolcke et al., 2000) report good accuracy (87%) for statement vs. question classification on manual Switchboard transcripts, such coarse-grained information might be reliably available.","Surprisingly, using the oracle context features (the correct classification for the previous you) alone performs worse than the baseline; and adding these features to sentential features gives no improvement. This suggests that the generic/referential status of each you may be independent of previous yous.

Mean pitch, intensity and duration were extracted using Praat, both averaged over the entire utterance and just for the word “you” . Classification results are shown in Table 4. Using only prosodic features performs below the baseline; in-cluding prosodic features with the best-performing feature set from Table 3 gives identical performance to that with lexical and contextual features alone.","To see why the prosodic features did not help, we examined the difference between the average pitch, intensity and duration for referential versus generic cases (Table 5). A one-sided t-test shows no significant differences between the average intensity and duration (confirming the results of (Jurafsky et al., 2002), who found no significant change in duration). The difference in the average pitch was found to be significant (p=0.2) – but not enough for this feature alone to cause an increase in overall accuracy."]},{"title":"7 Error Analysis","paragraphs":["We performed an error analysis on our best classifier output on the training set; accuracy was 94.53%, giving a total of 36 errors.","Half of the errors (18 of 36) were ambiguous even for humans (the authors), if looking at the sentence alone without the neighboring context from the actual conversation – see (5a). Treating these examples thus needs a detailed model of dialog context.","The other major class of errors requires detailed 107 knowledge about sentential semantics and/or the world – see e.g. (5b,c), which we can tell are referential because they predicate inter-personal comparison or communication.","In addition, as questions are such a useful feature (see above), the classifier tends to label all question cases as referential. However, generic uses do occur within questions (5d), especially if rhetorical (5e):","(5) a. so uh and if you don’t have the money then use a","credit card b. I’m probably older than you c. although uh I will personally tell you I used to work","at a bank d. Do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter","time? e. my question I guess are they really your peers?"]},{"title":"8 Initial Multi-Party Experiments","paragraphs":["The experiments above used two-person dialog data: we expect that multi-party data is more complex. We performed an initial exploratory study, applying the same classes and features to multi-party meetings.","Two annotators labeled one meeting from the AMI corpus (Carletta et al., 2006), giving a total of 52 utterances containing “you” on which to assess agreement: kappa was 87.18% for two way classification of generic versus referential. One of the authors then labeled a testing set of 203 utterances; 104 are generic and 99 referential, giving a baseline accuracy of 51.23% (and F-score of 67.65%).","We performed experiments for the same task: detecting generic versus referential uses. Due to the small amount of data, we trained the classifier on the Switchboard training set from section 3 (i.e. on two-party rather than multi-party data). Lacking part-of-speech or dialog act features (since the dialog act tagset differs from the Switchboard tagset), we used only the sentential, context and question mark features described in Table 2.","However, the classifier still achieves an accuracy of 73.89% and F-score of 74.15%, comparable to the results on Switchboard without dialog act features (accuracy 76.30%). Precision is lower, though (both precision and recall are 73-75%)."]},{"title":"9 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have presented results on two person and multi-party data for the task of generic versus referential “you” detection. We have seen that the problem is a real one: in both datasets the distribution of the classes is approximately 50/50, and baseline accuracy is low. Classifier accuracy on two-party data is reasonable, and we see promising results on multi-party data with a basic set of features. We expect the accuracy to go up once we train and test on same-genre data and also add features that are more specific to multi-party data."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["J. Carletta, S.
