Compared to the well known N-gram language models, discriminative language models can achieve more accurate discrimination because they can employ overlapping features and non-local information. However, discriminative language models have been used only for re-ranking in specific applications because negative examples are not available. We propose sampling pseudo-negative examples taken from probabilistic language models. However, this approach requires prohibitive computational cost if we are dealing with quite a few features and training samples. We tackle the problem by estimating the latent information in sentences using a semi-Markov class model, and then extracting features from them. We also use an online margin-based algorithm with efficient kernel computation. Experimental results show that pseudo-negative examples can be treated as real negative examples and our model can classify these sentences correctly."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Language models (LMs) are fundamental tools for many applications, such as speech recognition, machine translation and spelling correction. The goal of LMs is to determine whether a sentence is correct or incorrect in terms of grammars and pragmatics.","The most widely used LM is a probabilistic language model (PLM), which assigns a probability to a sentence or a word sequence. In particular, N-grams with maximum likelihood estimation (NLMs) are often used. Although NLMs are simple, they are effective for many applications.","However, NLMs cannot determine correctness","of a sentence independently because the probabil-","ity depends on the length of the sentence and the","global frequencies of each word in it. For exam-","ple,","","","  ","","","","","",", where","","","","is the probability","of a sentence","given by an NLM, does not always","mean that ","is more correct, but instead could occur","when"," is shorter than","",",orif","","has more com-","mon words than","",". Another problem is that NLMs","cannot handle overlapping information or non-local","information easily, which is important for more ac-","curate sentence classification. For example, a NLM","could assign a high probability to a sentence even if","it does not have a verb.","Discriminative language models (DLMs) have been proposed to classify sentences directly as correct or incorrect (Gao et al., 2005; Roark et al., 2007), and these models can handle both non-local and overlapping information. However DLMs in previous studies have been restricted to specific applications. Therefore the model cannot be used for other applications. If we had negative examples available, the models could be trained directly by discriminating between correct and incorrect sentences.","In this paper, we propose a generic DLM, which can be used not only for specific applications, but also more generally, similar to PLMs. To achieve 73 this goal, we need to solve two problems. The first is that since we cannot obtain negative examples (incorrect sentences), we need to generate them. The second is the prohibitive computational cost because the number of features and examples is very large. In previous studies this problem did not arise because the amount of training data was limited and they did not use a combination of features, and thus the computational cost was negligible.","To solve the first problem, we propose sampling incorrect sentences taken from a PLM and then training a model to discriminate between correct and incorrect sentences. We call these examples Pseudo-Negative because they are not actually negative sentences. We call this method DLM-PN (DLM with Pseudo-Negative samples).","To deal with the second problem, we employ an online margin-based learning algorithm with fast kernel computation. This enables us to employ combinations of features, which are important for discrimination between correct and incorrect sentences. We also estimate the latent information in sentences by using a semi-Markov class model to extract features. Although there are substantially fewer latent features than explicit features such as words or phrases, latent features contain essential information for sentence classification.","Experimental results show that these pseudo-negative samples can be treated as incorrect examples, and that DLM-PN can learn to correctly discriminate between correct and incorrect sentences and can therefore classify these sentences correctly."]},{"title":"2 Previous work","paragraphs":["Probabilistic language models (PLMs) estimate the","probability of word strings or sentences.

In this model, pseudo-negative examples, which are all assumed to be incorrect, are sampled from PLMs.","First a PLM is built using training data and then examples, which are almost all negative, are sampled independently from PLMs. DLMs are trained using correct sentences from a corpus and negative examples from a Pseudo-Negative generator.","An advantage of sampling is that as many negative examples can be collected as correct ones, and a distinction can be clearly made between truly correct sentences and incorrect sentences, even though the latter might be correct in a local sense.","For sampling, any PLMs can be used as long as the model supports a sentence sampling procedure.

However in contrast to the support set in SVMs, an example is added to the active set every time the online algorithm makes a prediction mistake or when its confidence in a prediction is inadequately low. Therefore the active set can increase in size significantly and thus the total computational cost becomes proportional to the square of the number of training examples. Since the number of training examples is very large, the computational cost is prohibitive even if we apply the kernel trick.","The calculation of the inner product between two examples can be done by intersection of the activated features in each example.

In particular, the memory requirement becomes a serious problem because quite a few active sets with many features have to be stored, not only at training time, but also at classification time. One way to deal with this is to filter out low-confidence features, but it is difficult to decide which features are important in online learning. For this reason we cluster similar N-grams using a semi-Markov class model.","The class model was originally proposed by (Martin et al., 1998). In the class model, deterministic word-to-class mappings are estimated, keeping the number of classes much smaller than the number of distinct words. A semi-Markov class model (SMCM) is an extended version of the class model, a part of which was proposed by (Deligne and BIM-BOT, 1995). In SMCM, a word sequence is partitioned into a variable-length sequence of chunks and then chunks are clustered into classes (Figure 4). How a chunk is clustered depends on which chunks are adjacent to it.","The probability of a sentence","","","","","","","",",ina bi-gram class model is calculated by"," ","","","","","","","","","  ","","","","","","","","","","(7) On the other hand, the probabilities in a bi-gram semi-Markov class model are calculated by","   ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","     ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(8)","where","varies over all possible partitions of",",","","","","and","","","","denote the start and end positions respec-","tively of the","-th chunk in partition , and","","","",""," 76","    ","for all",".

First, all words are assigned to a randomly determined class. Next, for each word",", we move it to the class","for which the log-likelihood is maximized. This procedure is continued until the log-likelihood converges to a local maximum. A naive implementation of the clustering algorithm scales quadratically to the number of classes, since each time a word is moved between classes, all class bi-gram counts are potentially affected. However, by considering only those counts that actually change, the algorithm can be made to scale somewhere between linearly and quadratically to the number of classes (Martin et al., 1998).","In SMCM, partitions of each sentence are also determined. We used a Viterbi decoding (Deligne and BIMBOT, 1995) for the partition. We applied the exchange algorithm and the Viterbi decoding alternately until the log-likelihood converged to the local maximum.","Since the number of chunks is very large, for example, in our experiments we used about","million chunks, the computational cost is still large.

The result for an native English speaker was that all positive sentences were labeled as correct and all negative sentences except for one were labeled as incorrect. On the other hand, the results for non-native English speakers are 67","and 70",". From this result, we can say that the sampling method was able to generate incorrect sentences and if a classifier can discriminate them, the classifier can also discriminate between correct and incorrect sentences. Note that it takes an average of 25 seconds for the native English speaker to assign the label, which suggests that it is difficult even for a human to determine the correctness of a sentence.","We then examined whether it was possible to discriminate between correct and incorrect sentences using parsing methods, since if so, we could have used parsing as a classification tool.

This could be because negative examples include many unsuitable combinations of words such as a sentence contain-ing many nouns. Although in previous PLMs, combination of features has not been discussed except for the topic-based language model (David M. Blei, 2003; Wang et al., 2005), our result may encourage the study of the combination of features for language modeling.","A contrastive estimation method (Smith and Eisner, 2005) is similar to ours with regard to construct-ing pseudo-negative examples. They build a neighborhood of input examples to allow unsupervised estimation when, for example, a word is changed or deleted. A lattice is constructed, and then parameters are estimated efficiently. On the other hand, we construct independent pseudo-negative examples to enable training. Although the motivations of these studies are different, we could combine these two methods to discriminate sentences finely.","In our experiments, we did not examine the result of using other sampling methods, For example, it would be possible to sample sentences from a whole sentence maximum entropy model (Rosenfeld et al., 2001) and this is a topic for future research. 79"]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper we have presented a novel discriminative language model using pseudo-negative examples. We also showed that an online margin-based learning method enabled us to use half a million sentences as training data and achieve","accuracy in the task of discrimination between correct and incorrect sentences. Experimental results indicate that while pseudo-negative examples can be seen as incorrect sentences, they are also close to correct sentences in that parsers cannot discriminate between them.","Our experimental results also showed that combination of features is important for discrimination between correct and incorrect sentences. This concept has not been discussed in previous probabilistic language models.","Our next step is to employ our model in machine translation and speech recognition. One main difficulty concerns how to encode global scores for the classifier in the local search space, and another is how to scale up the problem size in terms of the number of examples and features. We would like to see more refined online learning methods with kernels (Cheng et al., 2006; Dekel et al., 2005) that we could apply in these areas.","We are also interested in applications such as constructing an extended version of a spelling correction tool by identifying incorrect sentences.","Another interesting idea is to work with probabilistic language models directly without sampling and find ways to construct a more accurate discriminative model."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Eugene Charniak and Mark Johnson. 2005.
