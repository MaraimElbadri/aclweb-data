This is the basic intelligent procedure, and is important in text mining systems (M. W. Berry, 2003). As the specific application, relevant feedback in IR, where retrieved documents are clustered, is actively researched (Hearst and Pedersen, 1996)(Kummamuru et al., 2004).","In document clustering, the document is represented as a vector, which typically uses the “bag of word” model and the TF-IDF term weight. A vector represented in this manner is highly dimensional and sparse. Thus, in document clustering, a dimensional reduction method such as PCA or SVD is applied before actual clustering (Boley et al., 1999)(Deerwester et al., 1990). Dimensional reduction maps data in a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space, and improves both clustering accuracy and speed.","NMF is a dimensional reduction method (Xu et al., 2003) that is based on the “aspect model” used in the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (Hofmann, 1999). Because the axis in the reduced space by NMF corresponds to a topic, the reduced vector represents the clustering result. For a given term-document matrix and cluster number, we can obtain the NMF result with an iterative procedure (Lee and Seung, 2000). However, this iteration does not always converge to a global optimum solution. That is, NMF results depend on the initial value. The standard countermeasure for this problem is to generate multiple clustering results by changing the initial value, and then select the best clustering result estimated by an object function. However, this selection often fails because the object function does not always measure clustering accuracy.","To overcome this problem, we use ensemble clustering, which combines multiple clustering results to obtain an accurate clustering result.","Ensemble clustering consists of generation and integration phases. The generation phase produces multiple clustering results. Many strategies have been proposed to achieve this goal, including random initialization (Fred and Jain, 2002), feature extraction based on random projection (Fern and Brodley, 2003) and the combination of sets of “weak” partitions (Topchy et al., 2003). The integration phase, as the name implies, integrates multiple clustering results to improve the accuracy of the final clustering result. This phase primarily relies on two methods. The first method constructs a new simi-77 larity matrix from multiple clustering results (Fred and Jain, 2002). The second method constructs new vectors for each instance data using multiple clustering results (Strehl and Ghosh, 2002). Both methods apply the clustering procedure to the new object to obtain the final clustering result.","Our method generates multiple clustering results by random initialization of the NMF, and integrates them with a weighted hypergraph instead of the standard hypergraph (Strehl and Ghosh, 2002). An advantage of our method is that the weighted hypergraph can be directly obtained from the NMF result.","In our experiment, we compared the k-means, NMF, the ensemble method using a standard hypergraph and the ensemble method using a weighted hypergraph. Our method achieved the best results."]},{"title":"2 NMF","paragraphs":["The NMF decomposes the","","","term-document","matrix","to the ","","matrix","and the transposed","matrix of the",""," matrix","(Xu et al., 2003), where","","is the number of clusters; that is,",""," ","","","The","-th document","","corresponds to the","-th row","vector of V; that is,","","","","","  ","","","","","","",".
