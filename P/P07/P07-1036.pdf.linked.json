In this paper, we suggest a method for incorporating domain knowledge in semi-supervised learning algorithms. Our novel framework unies and can exploit several kinds of task specic constraints. The experimental results presented in the information extraction domain demonstrate that applying constraints helps the model to generate better feedback during learning, and hence the framework allows for high performance learning with significantly less training data than was possible before on these tasks."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems typically require large amounts of knowledge to achieve good performance. Acquiring labeled data is a difcult and expensive task. Therefore, an increasing attention has been recently given to semi-supervised learning, where large amounts of unlabeled data are used to improve the models learned from a small training set (Collins and Singer, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002). The hope is that semi-supervised or even unsupervised approaches, when given enough knowledge about the structure of the problem, will be competitive with the supervised models trained on large training sets. However, in the general case, semi-supervised approaches give mixed results, and sometimes even degrade the model performance (Nigam et al., 2000). In many cases, improving semi-supervised models was done by seed-ing these models with domain information taken from dictionaries or ontology (Cohen and Sarawagi, 2004; Collins and Singer, 1999; Haghighi and Klein, 2006; Thelen and Riloff, 2002). On the other hand, in the supervised setting, it has been shown that incorporating domain and problem specic structured information can result in substantial improve-ments (Toutanova et al., 2005; Roth and Yih, 2005).","This paper proposes a novel constraints-based learning protocol for guiding semi-supervised learning. We develop a formalism for constraints-based learning that unies several kinds of constraints: unary, dictionary based and n-ary constraints, which encode structural information and interdependencies among possible labels. One advantage of our formalism is that it allows capturing different levels of constraint violation. Our protocol can be used in the presence of any learning model, including those that acquire additional statistical constraints from observed data while learning (see Section 5. In the experimental part of this paper we use HMMs as the underlying model, and exhibit signicant reduction in the number of training examples required in two information extraction problems.","As is often the case in semi-supervised learning, the algorithm can be viewed as a process that improves the model by generating feedback through 280 labeling unlabeled examples. Our algorithm pushes this intuition further, in that the use of constraints allows us to better exploit domain information as a way to label, along with the current learned model, unlabeled examples. Given a small amount of labeled data and a large unlabeled pool, our framework initializes the model with the labeled data and then repeatedly: (1) Uses constraints and the learned model to label the instances in the pool. (2) Updates the model by newly labeled data.","This way, we can generate better training examples during the semi-supervised learning process. The core of our approach, (1), is described in Section 5. The task is described in Section 3 and the Experimental study in Section 6. It is shown there that the improvement on the training examples via the constraints indeed boosts the learned model and the proposed method signicantly outperforms the traditional semi-supervised framework."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["In the semi-supervised domain there are two main approaches for injecting domain specic knowledge. One is using the prior knowledge to accurately tailor the generative model so that it captures the domain structure. For example, (Grenager et al., 2005) proposes Diagonal Transition Models for sequential labeling tasks where neighboring words tend to have the same labels. This is done by constraining the HMM transition matrix, which can be done also for other models, such as CRF. However (Roth and Yih, 2005) showed that reasoning with more expressive, non-sequential constraints can improve the performance for the supervised protocol.","A second approach has been to use a small high-accuracy set of labeled tokens as a way to seed and bootstrap the semi-supervised learning. This was used, for example, by (Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Collins and Singer, 1999) in information extraction, and by (Smith and Eisner, 2005) in POS tagging. (Haghighi and Klein, 2006) extends the dictionary-based approach to sequential labeling tasks by propagating the information given in the seeds with contextual word similarity. This follows a conceptually similar approach by (Cohen and Sarawagi, 2004) that uses a large named-entity dictionary, where the similarity between the candidate named-entity and its matching prototype in the dictionary is encoded as a feature in a supervised classier.","In our framework, dictionary lookup approaches are viewed as unary constraints on the output states. We extend these kinds of constraints and allow for more general, n-ary constraints.","In the supervised learning setting it has been established that incorporating global information can signicantly improve performance on several NLP tasks, including information extraction and semantic role labeling. (Punyakanok et al., 2005; Toutanova et al., 2005; Roth and Yih, 2005). Our formalism is most related to this last work. But, we develop a semi-supervised learning protocol based on this formalism. We also make use of soft constraints and, furthermore, extend the notion of soft constraints to account for multiple levels of constraints’ violation. Conceptually, although not technically, the most related work to ours is (Shen et al., 2005) that, in a somewhat ad-hoc manner uses soft constraints to guide an unsupervised model that was crafted for mention tracking. To the best of our knowledge, we are the rst to suggest a general semi-supervised protocol that is driven by soft constraints.","We propose learning with constraints - a framework that combines the approaches described above in a unied and intuitive way."]},{"title":"3 Tasks, Examples and Datasets","paragraphs":["In Section 4 we will develop a general framework for semi-supervised learning with constraints. However, it is useful to illustrate the ideas on concrete problems. Therefore, in this section, we give a brief introduction to the two domains on which we tested our algorithms. We study two information extraction problems in each of which, given text, a set of pre-dened elds is to be identied. Since the elds are typically related and interdependent, these kinds of applications provide a good test case for an approach like ours.1","The rst task is to identify elds from citations (McCallum et al., 2000) .

Part (a) of the gure shows the correct labeled assignment and part (b) shows the assignment labeled by a HMM trained on 30 labels. However, if we apply the constraint that state transition can occur only on punctuation marks, the same HMM model parameters will result in the correct labeling (a). Therefore, by adding the improved labeled assignment we can generate better training samples during semi-supervised learning. In fact, the punctuation marks are only some of the constraints that can be applied to this problem. The set of constraints we used in our experiments appears in Table 1. Note that some of the constraints are non-local and are very intuitive for people, yet it is very difcult to inject this knowledge into most models.","The second problem we consider is extracting elds from advertisements (Grenager et al., 2005). The dataset consists of 8,767 advertisements for apartment rentals in the San Francisco Bay Area downloaded in June 2004 from the Craigslist website. In the dataset, only 302 entries have been labeled with 12 elds, including size, rent, neighborhood, features, and so on. The data was preprocessed using regular expressions for phone numbers, email addresses and URLs. The list of the constraints for this domain is given in Table 1. We implement some global constraints and include unary constraints which were largely imported from the list of seed words used in (Haghighi and Klein, 2006). We slightly modied the seedwords due to difference in preprocessing."]},{"title":"4 Notation and Denitions","paragraphs":["Consider a structured classication problem, where given an input sequence x = (x1, . . . , xN ), the task is to nd the best assignment to the output variables y = (y1, . . . , yM ).

Y that uses a global scoring function f : X Y ! R to assign scores to each possible input/output pair. Given an input x, a desired function f will assign the correct output y the highest score among all the possible outputs. The global scoring function is often decomposed as a weighted sum of feature functions, f (x, y) = M ∑ i=1 λifi(x, y) = λ F (x, y). This decomposition applies both to discriminative linear models and to generative models such as HMMs and CRFs, in which case the linear sum corresponds to log likelihood assigned to the input/output pair by the model (for details see (Roth, 1999) for the classication case and (Collins, 2002) for the structured case). Even when not dictated by the model, the feature functions fi(x, y) used are local to allow inference tractability. Local feature function can capture some context for each input or output variable, yet it is very limited to allow dynamic programming decoding during inference.","Now, consider a scenario where we have a set of constraints C1, . . . , CK .

Moreover, we want to incorporate into our cost function a measure for the amount of violation incurred by violating the constraint. A generic way to capture this intuition is to introduce a distance function d(y, 1Ci(x)) between the space of outputs that respect the constraint,1Ci(x), and the given output sequence y. One possible way to implement this distance function is as the minimal Hamming distance to a sequence that respects the constraint Ci, that is: d(y, 1Ci(x)) = min(y′","∈1C(x)) H(y, y′",").

The second term biases the mode by using the knowledge encoded in the constraints. Note that we do not normalize our objective function to be a true probability distribution."]},{"title":"5 Learning and Inference with Constraints","paragraphs":["In this section we present a new constraint-driven learning algorithm (CODL) for using constraints to guide semi-supervised learning. The task is to learn the parameter vector λ by using the new objective function (1). While our formulation allows us to train also the coefcients of the constraints valuation, ρi, we choose not to do it, since we view this as a way to bias (or enforce) the prior knowledge into the learned model, rather than allowing the data to brush it away. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is robust to inaccurate approximation of the prior knowledge (assigning the same penalty to all the ρi ).","We note that in the presence of constraints, the inference procedure (for nding the output y that maximizes the cost function) is usually done with search techniques (rather than Viterbi decoding, see (Toutanova et al., 2005; Roth and Yih, 2005) for a discussion), we chose beamsearch decoding.","The semi-supervised learning with constraints is done with an EM-like procedure. We initialize the model with traditional supervised learning (ignoring the constraints) on a small labeled set. Given an unlabeled set U , in the estimation step, the traditional EM algorithm assigns a distribution over labeled assignments Y of each x 2 U , and in the maximization step, the set of model parameters is learned from the distributions assigned in the estimation step.","However, in the presence of constraints, assigning the complete distributions in the estimation step is infeasible since the constraints reshape the distribution in an arbitrary way. As in existing methods for training a model by maximizing a linear cost function (maximize likelihood or discriminative maxi-283 mization), the distribution over Y is represented as the set of scores assigned to it; rather than considering the score assigned to all y′","s, we truncate the distribution to the top K assignments as returned by the search. Given a set of K top assignments y1",", . . . , yK",", we approximate the estimation step by assigning uniform probability to the top K candidates, and zero to the other output sequences. We denote this algorithm top-K hard EM. In this paper, we use beamsearch to generate K candidates according to (1).","Our training algorithm is summarized in Figure 2. Several things about the algorithm should be claried: the Top-K-Inference procedure in line 7, the learning procedure in line 9, and the new parameter estimation in line 9.","The Top-K-Inference is a procedure that returns the K labeled assignments that maximize the new objective function (1). In our case we used the top-K elements in the beam, but this could be applied to any other inference procedure. The fact that the constraints are used in the inference procedure (in particular, for generating new training examples) allows us to use a learning algorithm that ignores the constraints, which is a lot more efcient (although algorithms that do take the constraints into account can be used too). We used maximum likelihood estimation of λ but, in general, perceptron or quasi-Newton can also be used.","It is known that traditional semi-supervised training can degrade the learned model’s performance. (Nigam et al., 2000) has suggested to balance the contribution of labeled and unlabeled data to the parameters. The intuition is that when iteratively estimating the parameters with EM, we disallow the parameters to drift too far from the supervised model. The parameter re-estimation in line 9, uses a similar intuition, but instead of weighting data instances, we introduced a smoothing parameter γ which controls the convex combination of models induced by the labeled and the unlabeled data. Unlike the technique mentioned above which focuses on naive Bayes, our method allows us to weight linear models generated by different learning algorithms.","Another way to look the algorithm is from the self-training perspective (McClosky et al., 2006).

One is that in self-training, once an unlabeled sample was labeled, it is never labeled again. In our case all the samples are relabeled in each iteration. In self-training it is often the case that only high-condence samples are added to the labeled data pool. While we include all the samples in the training pool, we could also limit ourselves to the high-condence samples. The second difference is that each unlabeled example generates K labeled instances. The case of one iteration of top-1 hard EM is equivalent to self training, where all the unlabeled samples are added to the labeled pool.","There are several possible benets to using K > 1 samples. (1) It effectively increases the training set by a factor of K (albeit by somewhat noisy examples). In the structured scenario, each of the top-K assignments is likely to have some good components so generating top-K assignments helps leveraging the noise.

Further-more, it is unreasonable to implement the exact computation for each constraint.

Moreover, our framework is a useful tool when the domain knowledge cannot be expressed by the model.","The results show that constraints improve not only the performance of the nal inference stage but also propagate useful information during the semi-supervised learning process and that training with the constraints is especially signicant when the number of labeled training data is small.
