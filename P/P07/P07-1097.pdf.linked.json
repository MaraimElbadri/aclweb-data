In the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) QA tracks organized by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), improvements in evaluation processes have kept pace with the evolu-tion of QA tasks. For the past several years, NIST has implemented an evaluation methodology based on the notion of “information nuggets” to assess answers to complex questions. As it has become the de facto standard for evaluating such systems, the research community stands to benefit from a better understanding of the characteristics of this evaluation methodology.","This paper explores recent refinements to the nugget-based evaluation methodology developed by NIST. In particular, we examine the recent so-called “pyramid extension” that incorporates relevance judgments from multiple assessors to improve evaluation stability (Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2006).","We organize our discussion as follows: The next section begins by providing a brief overview of nugget-based evaluations and the pyramid extension. Section 3 presents results from the first large-scale implementation of nugget pyramids for QA evaluation in TREC 2006. Analysis shows that this extension improves both stability and discriminative power. In Section 4, we discuss an alternative for combining multiple judgments that parallels the distinction between micro- and macro-averaging often seen in classification tasks. Experiments reveal that the methods yield almost exactly the same results, despite operating on different granularities (individual nuggets vs. individual users)."]},{"title":"2 Evaluating Complex Questions","paragraphs":["Complex questions are distinguished from factoid questions such as “Who shot Abraham Lincoln?” in that they cannot be answered by named entities (e.g., persons, organizations, dates, etc.). Typically, these information needs are embedded in the context of a scenario (i.e., user task) and often require systems to 768 synthesize information from multiple documents or to generate answers that cannot be easily extracted (e.g., by leveraging inference capabilities).","To date, NIST has already conducted several large-scale evaluations of complex questions: definition questions in TREC 2003, “Other” questions in TREC 2004–2006, “relationship” questions in TREC 2005, and the complex, interactive QA (ciQA) task in TREC 2006. Definition and Other questions are similar in that they both request novel facts about “targets”, which can be persons, organizations, things, and events. Relationship questions evolved into the ciQA task and focus on information needs such as “What financial relationships exist between South American drug cartels and banks in Liechtenstein?” Such complex questions focus on ties (financial, military, familial, etc.) that connect two or more entities. All of these evaluations have employed the nugget-based methodology, which demonstrates its versatility and applicability to a wide range of information needs. 2.1 Basic Setup In the TREC QA evaluations, an answer to a complex question consists of an unordered set of [document-id, answer string] pairs, where the strings are presumed to provide some relevant information that addresses the question. Although no explicit limit is placed on the length of the answer, the final metric penalizes verbosity (see below).","Evaluation of system output proceeds in two steps. First, answer strings from all submissions are gathered together and presented to a single assessor. The source of each answer string is blinded so that the assessor can not obviously tell which systems generated what output. Using these answers and searches performed during question development, the assessor creates a list of relevant nuggets. A nugget is a piece of information (i.e., “fact”) that addresses one aspect of the user’s question. Nuggets should be atomic, in the sense that an assessor should be able to make a binary decision as to whether the nugget appears in an answer string. Although a nugget represents a conceptual entity, the assessor provides a natural language description—primarily as a memory aid for the subsequent evaluation steps. These descriptions range from sentence-length document extracts to r = # of vital nuggets returned a = # of okay nuggets returned R = # of vital nuggets in the answer key l = # of non-whitespace characters in entire run recall: R = r/R allowance: α = 100 × (r + a) precision: P = { 1 if l < α","1 − l−α","l otherwise F (β) =","(β2 + 1) × P × R β2","× P + R Figure 1: Official definition of F-score for nugget evaluation in TREC. key phrases to telegraphic short-hand notes—their readability greatly varies from assessor to assessor.","The assessor also manually classifies each nugget as either vital or okay (non-vital). Vital nuggets represent concepts that must be present in a “good” answer. Okay nuggets may contain interesting information, but are not essential.","In the second step, the same assessor who created the nuggets reads each system’s output in turn and marks the appearance of the nuggets. An answer string contains a nugget if there is a conceptual match; that is, the match is independent of the particular wording used in the system’s output. A nugget match is marked at most once per run—i.e., a system is not rewarded for retrieving a nugget multiple times. If the system’s output contains more than one match for a nugget, the best match is selected and the rest are left unmarked. A single [document-id, answer string] pair in a system response can match 0, 1, or multiple nuggets.","The final F-score for an answer is calculated in the manner described in Figure 1, and the final score of a run is the average across the F-scores of all questions. The metric is a weighted harmonic mean between nugget precision and nugget recall, where recall is heavily favored (controlled by the β parameter, usually set to three). Nugget recall is calculated solely on vital nuggets, while nugget precision is ap-proximated by a length allowance based on the number of both vital and okay nuggets returned. In an 769 earlier pilot study, researchers discovered that it was not possible for assessors to consistently enumerate the total set of nuggets contained in an answer, which corresponds to the denominator in a precision calculation (Voorhees, 2003). Thus, a penalty for verbosity serves as a surrogate for precision. 2.2 The Pyramid Extension The vital/okay distinction has been identified as a weakness in the TREC nugget-based evaluation methodology (Hildebrandt et al., 2004; Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2005; Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2006). There do not appear to be any reliable indicators for predicting nugget importance, which makes it challenging to develop algorithms sensitive to this consideration. Since only vital nuggets affect nugget recall, it is difficult for systems to achieve non-zero scores on topics with few vital nuggets in the answer key. Thus, scores are easily affected by assessor errors and other random variations in evaluation conditions.","One direct consequence is that in previous TREC evaluations, the median score for many questions turned out to be zero. A binary distinction on nugget importance is insufficient to discriminate between the quality of runs that return no vital nuggets but different numbers of okay nuggets. Also, a score distribution heavily skewed towards zero makes meta-analyses of evaluation stability difficult to per-form (Voorhees, 2005).","The pyramid extension (Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2006) was proposed to address the issues mentioned above. The idea was relatively simple: by soliciting vital/okay judgments from multiple assessors (after the list of nuggets has been produced by a primary assessor), it is possible to define nugget importance with greater granularity. Each nugget is assigned a weight between zero and one that is proportional to the number of assessors who judged it to be vital. Nugget recall from Figure 1 can be redefined to incorporate these weights: R = ∑ m∈A wm ∑ n∈V wn","Where A is the set of reference nuggets that are matched in a system’s output and V is the set of all reference nuggets; wm and wn are the weights of nuggets m and n, respectively.1","The calculation of nugget precision remains the same."]},{"title":"3 Nugget Pyramids in TREC 2006","paragraphs":["Lin and Demner-Fushman (2006) present experimental evidence in support of nugget pyramids by applying the proposal to results from previous TREC QA evaluations. Their simulation studies appear to support the assertion that pyramids address many of the issues raised in Section 2.2. Based on the results, NIST proceeded with a trial deployment of nugget pyramids in the TREC 2006 QA track. Although scores based on the binary vital/okay distinction were retained as the “official” metric, pyramid scores were simultaneously computed. This provided an opportunity to compare the two methodologies on a large scale. 3.1 The Data The basic unit of evaluation for the main QA task at TREC 2006 was the “question series”. Each series focused on a “target”, which could be a person, organization, thing, or event. Individual questions in a series inquired about different facets of the target, and were explicitly classified as factoid, list, or Other. One complete series is shown in Figure 2. The Other questions can be best paraphrased as “Tell me interesting things about X that I haven’t already explicitly asked about.” It was the system’s task to retrieve interesting nuggets about the target (in the opinion of the assessor), but credit was not given for retrieving facts already explicitly asked for in the factoid and list questions. The Other questions were evaluated using the nugget-based methodology, and are the subject of this analysis.","The QA test set in TREC 2006 contained 75 series. Of the 75 targets, 19 were persons, 19 were organizations, 19 were events, and 18 were things. The series contained a total of 75 Other questions (one per target). Each series contained 6–9 questions (counting the Other question), with most series containing 8 questions. The task employed the AQUAINT collection of newswire text (LDC catalog number LDC2002T31), consisting of English data drawn from three sources: the New York Times,","1","Note that this new scoring model captures the existing binary vital/okay distinction in a straightforward way: vital nuggets get a score of one, and okay nuggets zero. 770","147 Britain’s Prince Edward marries 147.1 FACTOID When did Prince Edward engage to marry? 147.2 FACTOID Who did the Prince marry? 147.3 FACTOID Where did they honeymoon? 147.4 FACTOID Where was Edward in line for the throne at the time of the wedding? 147.5 FACTOID What was the Prince’s occupation? 147.6 FACTOID How many people viewed the wedding on television? 147.7 LIST What individuals were at the wedding? 147.8 OTHER Figure 2: Sample question series from TREC 2006.

There are approximately one million articles in the collection, totaling roughly three gigabytes. In total, 59 runs from 27 participants were submitted to NIST. For more details, see (Dang et al., 2006).","For the Other questions, nine sets of judgments were elicited from eight judges (the primary assessor who originally created the nuggets later annotated the nuggets once again). Each assessor was asked to assign the vital/okay label in a rapid fashion, without giving each decision much thought. Figure 3 gives an example of the multiple judgments for nuggets in Series 147. There is variation in notions of importance not only between different assessors, but also for a single assessor over time. 3.2 Results After the human annotation process, nugget pyramids were built in the manner described by Lin and Demner-Fushman (2006). Two scores were computed for each run submitted to the TREC 2006 main QA task: one based on the vital/okay judgments of the primary assessor (which we call the binary F-score) and one based on the nugget pyramids (the pyramid F-score). The characteristics of the pyramid method can be inferred by comparing these two sets of scores.","Figure 4 plots the average binary and average pyramid F-scores for each run (which represents average performance across all series). Even though the nugget pyramid does not represent any single real user (a point we return to later), pyramid F-scores do correlate highly with the binary F-scores. The Pearson’s correlation is 0.987, with a 95% confidence interval of [0.980, 1.00].","While the average F-score for a run is stable given a sufficient number of questions, the F-score for a single Other question exhibits greater variability across assessors. This is shown in Figure 5, which plots binary and pyramid F-scores for individual questions from all runs. In this case, the Pearson correlation is 0.870, with a 95% confidence interval of [0.863, 1.00].","For 16.4% of all Other questions, the nugget pyramid assigned a non-zero F-score where the original binary F-score was zero. This can be seen in the band of points on the left edge of the plot in Figure 5.

This is a key capability that is useful for system developers, particularly since algorithmic improvements are often incremental and small.","Because it is more stable than the single-assessor method of evaluation, the pyramid method also appears to have greater discriminative power. We fit a two-way analysis of variance model with the series and run as factors, and the binary F-score as the dependent variable. We found significant differences between series and between runs (p essentially equal to 0 for both factors). To determine which runs were significantly different from each other, we performed a multiple comparison using Tukey’s honestly significant difference criterion and controlling for the experiment-wise Type I error so that the probability of declaring a difference between two runs to be significant, when it is actually not, is at most 5%. With 59 runs, there are C59","2 = 1711 different pairs that can be compared. The single-assessor method was able to declare one run to be significantly better than the other in 557 of these pairs. Using the pyramid F-scores, it was possible to find significant differences in performance between runs in 617 pairs. 3.3 Discussion Any evaluation represents a compromise between effort (which correlates with cost) and insightfulness of results.

Modifications to existing processes usually come at a cost that needs to be weighed against potential gains. Based on these considerations, the balance sheet for nugget pyramids shows a favorable orientation. In the TREC 2006 QA evaluation, soliciting vital/okay judgments from multiple assessors was not very time-consuming (a couple of hours per assessor). Analysis confirms that pyramid scores confer many benefits at an acceptable cost, thus arguing for its adoption in future evaluations.","Cost considerations precluded exploring other refinements to the nugget-based evaluation methodology. One possible alternative would involve ask-ing multiple assessors to create different sets of nuggets from scratch. Not only would this be time-consuming, one would then need to deal with the additional complexities of aligning each assessor’s nuggets list. This includes resolving issues such as nugget granularity, overlap in information content, implicature and other relations between nuggets, etc."]},{"title":"4 Exploration of Alternative Structures","paragraphs":["Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of nugget pyramids, there are a few potential drawbacks that are worth discussing. One downside is that the nugget pyramid does not represent a single assessor. The nugget weights reflect the aggregation of opinions across a sample population, but there is no guar-772 antee that the method for computing those weights actually captures any aspect of real user behavior. It can be argued that the binary F-score is more realistic since it reflects the opinion of a real user (the primary assessor), whereas the pyramid F-score tries to model the opinion of a mythical average user.","Although this point may seem somewhat counterintuitive, it represents a well-established tradition in the information retrieval literature (Voorhees, 2002). In document retrieval, for example, relevance judgments are provided by a single assessor—even though it is well known that there are large individual differences in notions of relevance. IR researchers believe that human idiosyncrasies are an inescapable fact present in any system designed for human users, and hence any attempt to remove those elements in the evaluation setup is actually undesir-able. It is the responsibility of researchers to develop systems that are robust and flexible. This premise, however, does not mean that IR evaluation results are unstable or unreliable. Analyses have shown that despite large variations in human opinions, system rankings are remarkably stable (Voorhees, 2000; Sormunen, 2002)—that is, one can usually be confident about system comparisons.","The philosophy in IR sharply contrasts with work in NLP annotation tasks such as parsing, word sense disambiguation, and semantic role labeling—where researchers strive for high levels of interannotator agreement, often through elaborate guidelines. The difference in philosophies arises because unlike these NLP annotation tasks, where the products are used primarily by other NLP system components, IR (and likewise QA) is an end-user task. These systems are intended for real world use. Since people differ, systems must be able to accommodate these differences. Hence, there is a strong preference in QA for evaluations that maintain a model of the individual user. 4.1 Micro- vs. Macro-Averaging The current nugget pyramid method leverages multiple judgments to define a weight for each individual nugget, and then incorporates this weight into the F-score computation. As an alternative, we propose another method for combining the opinions of multiple assessors: evaluate system responses individually against N sets of binary judgments, and then compute the mean across those scores. We define the macro-averaged binary F-score over a set A = {a1, ..., aN } of N assessors as: F =","∑ a∈A Fa N","Where Fa is the binary F-score according to the vital/okay judgments of assessor a. The differences between the pyramid F-score and the macro-averaged binary F-score correspond to the distinction between micro- and macro-averaging discussed in the context of text classification (Lewis, 1991). In those applications, both measures are mean-ingful depending on focus: individual instances or entire classes. In tasks where it is important to correctly classify individual instances, micro-averaging is more appropriate. In tasks where it is important to correctly identify a class, macro-averaging better quantifies performance. In classification tasks, imbalance in the prevalence of each class can lead to large differences in macro- and micro-averaged scores. Analogizing to our work, the original formulation of nugget pyramids corresponds to micro-averaging (since we focus on individual nuggets), while the alternative corresponds to macro-averaging (since we focus on the assessor).","We additionally note that the two methods encode different assumptions. Macro-averaging assumes that there is nothing intrinsically interesting about a nugget—it is simply a matter of a particular user with particular needs finding a particular nugget to be of interest. Micro-averaging, on the other hand, assumes that some nuggets are inherently interesting, independent of the particular interests of users.2","Each approach has characteristics that make it desirable. From the perspective of evaluators, the macro-averaged binary F-score is preferable because it models real users; each set of binary judgments represents the information need of a real user, each binary F-score represents how well an answer will satisfy a real user, and the macro-averaged binary F-score represents how well an answer will satisfy, on average, a sample population of real users. From the perspective of QA system developers, the micro-averaged nugget pyramid F-score is preferable because it allows finer discrimination in in-","2","We are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for this insight. 773 dividual nugget performance, which enables better techniques for system training and optimization.","The macro-averaged binary F-score has the same desirable properties as the micro-averaged pyramid F-score in that fewer responses will have zero F-scores as compared to the single-assessor binary F-score. We demonstrate this as follows. Let X be a response that receives a non-zero pyramid F-score. Let A = {a1, a2, a3, ..., aN } be the set of N assessors. Then it can be proven that X also receives a non-zero macro-averaged binary F-score:","1. There exists some nugget v with weight greater than 0, such that an answer string r in X matches v. (def. of pyramid recall)","2. There exists some assessor ap ∈ A who marked v as vital. (def. of pyramid nugget weight)","3. To show that X will also receive a non-zero macro-averaged binary score, it is sufficient to show that there is some assessor am ∈ A such that X receives a non-zero F-score when evaluated using just the vital/okay judgments of am. (def. of macro-averaged binary F-score)","4. But, such an assessor does exist, namely assessor ap: Consider the binary F-score assigned to X according to just assessor ap. The recall of X is greater than zero, since X contains the response r that matches the nugget v that was marked as vital by ap (from (2), (1), and the def. of recall). The precision must also be greater than zero (def. of precision). Therefore, the macro-averaged binary F-score of X is non-zero. (def. of F-score) 4.2 Analysis from TREC 2006 While the macro-averaged method is guaranteed to produce no more zero-valued scores than the micro-averaged pyramid method, it is not guaranteed that the scores will be the same for any given response. What are the empirical characteristics of each approach? To explore this question, we once again examined data from TREC 2006.","Figure 6 shows a scatter plot of the pyramid F-score and macro-averaged binary F-score for every Other questions in all runs from the TREC 2006 QA track main task.

Table 1 provides a summary of the correlations between the original binary F-score, the (micro-averaged) pyramid F-score, and the macro-averaged binary F-score. Pearson’s r is given for F-scores at the individual question level (first number) and at the run level (second number). The correlation between all three variants are about equal at the level of system runs. At the level of individual questions, the micro- and macro-averaged F-scores (using multiple judgments) are still highly correlated with each other, but each is less correlated with the single-assessor binary F-score. 4.3 Discussion The differences between macro- and micro-averaging methods invoke a more general discussion on notions of nugget importance. There are actually two different issues we are attempting to address with our different approaches: the first is a more granular scale of nugget importance, the second is variations across a population of users. In 774 the micro-averaged pyramid F-scores, we achieve the first by leveraging the second, i.e., binary judgments from a large population are combined to yield weights for individual nuggets. In the macro-averaged binary F-score, we focus solely on population effects without addressing granularity of nugget importance.","Exploring this thread of argument, we can for-mulate additional approaches for tackling these issues. We could, for example, solicit more granular individual judgments on each nugget from each assessor, perhaps on a Likert scale or as a continuous quantity ranging from zero to one. This would yield two more methods for computing F-scores, both a macro-averaged and a micro-averaged variant. The macro-averaged variant would be especially attractive because it reflects real users and yet individual F-scores remain discriminative. Despite its possible advantages, this extension is rejected based on resource considerations; making snap binary judgments on individual nuggets is much quicker than a multi-scaled value assignment—at least at present, the additional costs are not sufficient to offset the potential gains."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["The important role that large-scale evaluations play in guiding research in human language technologies means that the community must “get it right.” This would ordinarily call for a more conservative approach to avoid changes that might have unintended consequences. However, evaluation methodologies must evolve to reflect the shifting interests of the research community to remain relevant. Thus, organizers of evaluations must walk a fine line between progress and chaos. Nevertheless, the introduction of nugget pyramids in the TREC QA evaluation provides a case study showing how this fine balance can indeed be achieved. The addition of multiple judgments of nugget importance yields an evaluation that is both more stable and more discriminative than the original single-assessor evaluation, while requiring only a small additional cost in terms of human labor.","We have explored two different methods for combining judgments from multiple assessors to address shortcomings in the original nugget-based evaluation setup. Although they make different assump-tions about the evaluation, results from both approaches are highly correlated. Thus, we can continue employing the pyramid-based method, which is well-suited for developing systems, and still be as-sured that the results remain consistent with an evaluation method that maintains a model of real individual users."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work has been supported in part by DARPA contract HR0011-06-2-0001 (GALE).
