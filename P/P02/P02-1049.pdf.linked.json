Deployed systems and research prototypes exist for applications such as personal email and calendars, travel and restaurant information, personal banking, and customer care. Within the last few years, several spoken dialogue systems for widely used applications have moved from research labs into commercial use (Baggia et al., 1998; Gorin et al., 1997). These applications can receive millions of calls a month. There is a strong requirement for automatic methods to identify and extract dialogues that provide training data for further system development.","As a spoken dialogue system is developed, it is rst tested as a prototype, then elded in a limited setting, possibly running with human supervision (Gorin et al., 1997), and nally deployed. At each stage from research prototype to deployed commercial application, the system is constantly undergoing further development. When a system is prototyped in house or rst tested in the eld, human subjects are often paid to use the system and give detailed feedback on task completion and user satisfaction (Baggia et al., 1998; Walker et al., 2001). Even when a system is deployed, it often keeps evolving, either because customers want to do different things with it, or because new tasks arise out of developments in the underlying application. However, real customers of a deployed system may not be willing to give detailed feedback.","Thus, the widespread use of these systems has created a data management and analysis problem. System designers need to constantly track system performance, identify problems, and x them. System modules such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), natural language understanding (NLU) and dialogue management may rely on training data collected at each phase. ASR performance assessment relies on full transcription of the utterances. Dialogue manager assessment relies on a human interface expert reading a full transcription of the dialogue or listening to a recording of it, possibly while examining the logles to understand the interaction between all the components. However, because of the high volume of calls, spoken dialogue service providers typically can only afford to store, transcribe, and analyze a small fraction of the dialogues. Computational Linguistics (ACL), Philadelphia, July 2002, pp. 384-391. Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for","Therefore, there is a great need for methods for both automatically evaluating system performance, and for extracting subsets of dialogues that provide good training data for system improvement. This is a difcult problem because by the time a system is deployed, typically over 90% of the dialogue interactions result in completed tasks and satised users. Dialogues such as these do not provide very useful training data for further system development because there is little to be learned when the dialogue goes well.","Previous research on spoken dialogue evaluation proposed the application of automatic classiers for identifying and predicting of problematic dialogues (Litman et al., 1999; Walker et al., 2002) for the purpose of automatically adapting the dialogue manager. Here we apply similar methods to the dialogue corpus data-mining problem described above. We report results on automatically training a Problematic Dialogue Identier (PDI) to classify problematic human-computer dialogues using the October-2001 DARPA Communicator corpus.","Section 2 describes our approach and the dialogue corpus. Section 3 describes how we use the DATE dialogue act tagging scheme to dene input features for the PDI. Section 4 presents a method and results for automatically predicting task completion. Section 5 presents results for predicting problematic dialogues based on the user’s satisfaction. We show that we identify task failure dialogues with 85% accuracy (baseline 59%) and dialogues with low user satisfaction with up to 89% accuracy. We discuss the application of the PDI to data mining in Section 6. Finally, we summarize the paper and discuss future work."]},{"title":"2 Corpus, Methods and Data","paragraphs":["Our experiments apply CLASSIFICATION and REGRESSION trees (CART) (Brieman et al., 1984) to train a Problematic Dialogue Identier (PDI) from a corpus of human-computer dialogues. CLASSIFICATION trees are used for categorical response variables and REGRESSION trees are used for continuous response variables. CART trees are binary decision trees. A CLASSIFICATION tree species what queries to perform on the features to maximize CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY, while REGRESSION trees derive a set of queries to maximize the CORRELATION of the predicted value and the original value. Like other machine learners, CART takes as input the allowed values for the response variables; the names and ranges of values of a xed set of input features; and training data specifying the response variable value and the input feature values for each example in a training set. Below, we specify how the PDI was trained, rst describing the corpus, then the response variables, and nally the input features derived from the corpus.","Corpus: We train and test the PDI on the DARPA Communicator October-2001 corpus of 1242 dialogues. This corpus represents interactions with real users, with eight different Communicator travel planning systems, over a period of six months from April to October of 2001. The dialogue tasks range from simple domestic round trips to multileg international trips requiring both car and hotel arrangements. The corpus includes logles with logged events for each system and user turn; hand transcriptions and automatic speech recognizer (ASR) transcription for each user utterance; information derived from a user prole such as user dialect region; and a User Satisfaction survey and hand-labelled Task Completion metric for each dialogue. We randomly divide the corpus into 80% training (894 dialogues) and 20% testing (248 dialogues).","Dening the Response Variables: In principle, either low User Satisfaction or failure to complete the task could be used to dene problematic dialogues. Therefore, both of these are candidate response variables to be examined. The User Satisfaction measure derived from the user survey ranges between 5 and 25. Task Completion is a ternary measure where no Task Completion is indicated by 0, completion of only the airline itinerary is indicated by 1, and completion of both the airline itinerary and ground arrangements, such as car and hotel bookings, is indicated by 2. We also dened a binary version of Task Completion, where Binary Task Completion=0 when no task or subtask was complete (equivalent to Task Completion=0), and Binary Task Completion=1 where all or some of the task was complete (equivalent to Task Completion=1 or Task Completion=2).","Figure 1 shows the frequency of dialogues for varying User Satisfaction for cases where Task Completion is 0 (solid line) and Task Completion is greater than 0 (dotted lines). Note that Task Completion is 1 or 2 for a number of dialogues for which User Satisfaction is low. Figure 2 illustrates such a dialogue (system turns are labelled S, user turns as U, and ASR hypotheses as REC). Here, low User Satisfaction may be due to the fact that the user had to repeat herself many times before the system understood the departure city. An automatic surrogate for ASR accuracy (such as ASR condence) would Figure 1: User Satisfaction for dialogues where Task Completion is 0, 1 or 2 not be adequate for identifying this problematic dialogue, because here either the dialogue manager or the SLU component is at fault. Another dialogue subset of interest in Figure 1 is one for which Task Completion is 0 but User Satisfaction is high. A common cause for non-Task Completion in these dialogues is database access problems. The fact that the interaction went well until this point is not captured by the Task Completion metric. Thus we decided to use both User Satisfaction and Task Completion as response variables in separate experiments in order to allow the PDI to capture the relationship between these two variables.","Input Features: Both User Satisfaction and Task Completion predictors are trained using two types of automatically extractable features: (1) logle features; and (2) system dialogue act types. The logle features include efciency metrics such as the number of system and user turns spent on the task; the total time of the dialogue in milliseconds; and situational metrics, such as phone type1","which affects ASR.

In DATE, utterance classication is done along three cross-cutting orthogonal dimensions. The CONVERSATIONAL-DOMAIN dimension species the domain of discourse that an utterance is about. The SPEECH ACT dimension captures distinctions between communicative goals such as requesting information (REQUEST-INFO) or presenting information (PRESENT-INFO). The TASK-SUBTASK dimension species which travel reservation subtask the utterance contributes to. The SPEECH ACT and CONVERSATIONAL-DOMAIN dimensions are general across domains, while the TASK-SUBTASK dimension is domain- and sometimes system-specic.","Within the conversational domain dimension, DATE distinguishes three domains (see Figure 5). The ABOUT-TASK domain is necessary for evaluating a dialogue system’s ability to collaborate with a speaker on achieving the task goal. The ABOUT-COMMUNICATION domain reects the system goal of managing the verbal channel of communication and providing evidence of what has been understood. All implicit and explicit conrmations are about communication. The ABOUT-SITUATION-FRAME domain pertains to the goal of managing the user’s expectations about how to interact with the system.","DATE distinguishes 11 speech acts. Examples of each speech act are shown in Figure 6.","The TASK-SUBTASK dimension distinguishes among 28 subtasks, some of which can also be grouped at a level below the top level task.

The HOTEL task includes both the HOTEL-NAME and HOTEL-LOCATION subtasks.2","For the DATE labelling of the corpus, we implemented an extended version of the pattern matcher that was used for tagging the Communicator June 2000 corpus (Walker et al., 2001). This method identied and labelled an utterance or utterance sequence automatically by reference to a database of utterance patterns that were hand-labelled with the DATE tags. Before applying the pattern matcher, a named-entity labeler was applied to the system utterances, matching named-entities relevant in the travel domain, such as city, airport, car, hotel, airline names etc.. The named-entity labeler was also applied to the utterance patterns in the pattern database to allow for generality in the expression of communicative goals specied within DATE. For this named-entity labelling task, we collected vocabulary lists from the sites, which maintained such lists for","2","ABOUT-SITUATION-FRAME utterances are not specic to any particular task and can be used for any subtask, for example, system statements that it misunderstood.

For the extension, we collected a fresh set of vocabulary lists from the sites and augmented the pattern database with additional 800 labelled utterance patterns. We also implemented a contextual rule-based postprocessor that takes any remaining unlabelled utterances and attempts to label them by looking at their surround-ing DATE labels. More details about the extended tagger can be found in (Prasad and Walker, 2002). On the 2001 corpus, we were able to label 98.4  of the data. A hand evaluation of 10 randomly selected dialogues from each system shows that we achieved a classication accuracy of 96  at the utterance level.","For User Satisfaction Prediction, we found that the distribution of DATE acts were better captured by using the frequency normalized over the total number of dialogue acts. In addition to these unigram proportions, the bigram frequencies of the DATE dialogue acts were also calculated. In the following two sections, we discuss which DATE labels are discriminatory for predicting Task Completion and User Satisfaction."]},{"title":"4 The Task Completion Predictor","paragraphs":["In order to automatically predict Task Completion, we train a CLASSIFICATION tree to categorize dialogues into Task Completion=0, Task Completion=1 or Task Completion=2. Recall that a CLASSIFICATION tree attempts to maximize CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY, results for Task Completion are thus given in terms of percentage of dialogues correctly classied. The majority class baseline is 59.3% (dialogues where Task Completion=1). The tree was trained on a number of different input features. The most discriminatory ones, how-ever, were derived from the DATE tagger. We use the primitive DATE tags in conjunction with a feature called GroundCheck (GC), a boolean feature indicating the existence of DATE tags related to making ground arrangements, specically request info:hotel name, request info:hotel location, offer:hotel and offer:rental.","Table 1 gives the results for Task Completion prediction accuracy using the various types of features. 3 The named entities were preclassied into their respective","semantic classes by the sites.","Baseline Auto ALF + ALF +","Logle GC GC+ DATE","TC 59% 59% 79% 85%","BTC 86% 86% 86% 92% Table 1: Task Completion (TC) and Binary Task Completion (BTC) prediction results, using automatic logle features (ALF), GroundCheck (GC) and DATE unigram frequencies The rst row is for predicting ternary Task Completion, and the second for predicting binary Task Completion.

Row 2 also indicates that the DATE bigrams help performance, although the difference between R = .438 and R = .472 is not signicant.

Row 4 includes the best totally automatic system: using Automatic Binary Task Completion and DATE unigrams and bigrams yields a correlation of 0.484 (",").","Regression Tree Interpretation: It is interesting to examine the trees to see which features are used for predicting User Satisfaction. A metric called Feature Usage Frequency indicates which features are the most discriminatory in the CART tree. Specically, Feature Usage Frequency counts how often a feature is queried for each data point, normalized so that the sum of Feature Usage Frequency values for all the features sums to one. The higher a feature is in the tree, the more times it is queried. To calculate the Feature Usage Frequency, we grouped the features into three types: Task Completion, Logle features and DATE frequencies. Feature Usage Frequency for the logle features is 37%. Task Completion occurs only twice in the tree, however, it makes up 31because it occurs at the top of the tree. The Feature Usage Frequency for DATE category frequency is 32%. We will discuss each of these three groups of features in turn.","The most used logle feature is TurnsOnTask which is the number of turns which are task-oriented, for example, initial instructions on how to use the system are not taken as a TurnOnTask. Shorter dialogues tend to have a higher User Satisfaction. This is reected in the User Satisfaction scores in the tree. However, dialogues which are long (TurnsOnTask","79 ) can be satisfactory (User Satisfaction = 15.2) as long as the task that is completed is long, i.e., if ground arrangements are made in that dialogue (Task Completion=2). If ground arrangements are not made, the User Satisfaction is lower (11.6). Phone type is another important feature queried in the tree, so that dialogues conducted over corded phones have higher satisfaction. This is likely to be due to better recognition performance from corded phones.","As mentioned previously, Task Completion is at the top of the tree and is therefore the most queried feature. This captures the relationship between Task Completion and User Satisfaction as illustrated in Figure 1.","Finally, it is interesting to examine which DATE tags the tree uses. If there have been more than three acknowledgments of bookings, then several legs of a journey have been successfully booked, therefore User Satisfaction is high. In particular, User Satisfaction is high if the system has asked if the user would like a price for their itinerary which is one of the nal dialogue acts a system does before the task is completed. The DATE act about comm:apology:meta slu reject is a measure of the system’s level of misunderstanding. There-fore, the more of these dialogue act types the lower User Satisfaction. This part of the tree uses length in a similar way described earlier, whereby long dialogues are only allocated lower User Satisfaction if they do not involve ground arrangements. Users do not seem to mind longer dialogues as long as the system gives a number of implicit conrmations. The dialogue act request info:top level trip usually occurs at the start of the dialogue and requests the initial travel plan. If there are more than one of this dialogue act, it indicates that a START-OVER occurred due to system failure, and this leads to lower User Satisfaction. A rule containing the bigram request info:depart day month date+USER states that if there is more than one occurrence of this request then User Satisfaction will be lower. USER is the single category used for user-turns. No automatic method of predicting user speech act is avail-able yet for this data. A repetition of this DATE bigram indicates that a misunderstanding occurred the rst time it was requested, or that the task is multi-leg in which case User Satisfaction is generally lower.","The tree that uses Binary Task Completion is identical to the tree described above, apart from one binary decision which differentiates dialogues where Task Completion=1 and Task Completion=2. Instead of making this distinction, it just uses dialogue length to indicate the complexity of the task. In the original tree, long dialogues are not penalized if they have achieved a complex task (i.e. if Task Completion=2). The Binary Task Completion tree has no way of making this distinction and therefore just penalizes very long dialogues (where TurnsOnTask","110). The Feature Usage Frequency for the Task Completion features is reduced from 31% to 21%, and the Feature Usage Frequency for the logle features increases to 47%. We have shown that this more general tree produces slightly better results."]},{"title":"6 Results for Identifying Problematic Dialogues for Data Mining","paragraphs":["So far, we have described a PDI that predicts User Satisfaction as a continuous variable. For data mining, system developers will want to extract dialogues with predicted User Satisfaction below a particular threshold. This threshhold could vary during different stages of system development. As the system is ne tuned there will be fewer and fewer dialogues with low User Satisfaction, therefore in order to nd the interesting dialogues for system development one would have to raise the User Satisfaction threshold. In order to illustrate the potential value of our PDI, consider an example threshhold of 12 which divides the data into 73.4% good dialogues where User Satisfaction","12 which is our baseline result.","Table 3 gives the recall and precision for the PDIs described above which use hand-labelled Task Completion and Auto Task Completion.

Of the problematic dialogues, 54.5% are classied correctly (Recall). Of the dialogues that it classes as problematic 66.7% are problematic (Precision). The results for the automatic system show an improvement in Recall: it identies more problematic dialogues correctly (66.7%) but the precision is lower.","What do these numbers mean in terms of our original goal of reducing the number of dialogues that need to be transcribed to nd good cases to use Task Completion Dialogue Recall Prec.

Using the fully automatic PDI, one would obtain 12 problematic dialogues and 8 good dialogues. To look at it another way, to extract 15 problematic dialogues out of 100, 55% of the data would need transcribing. To obtain 15 problematic dialogues using the fully automatic PDI, only 26% of the data would need transcribing.
