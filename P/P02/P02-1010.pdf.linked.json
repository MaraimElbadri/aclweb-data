It is argued that the approach improves on previous proposals to integrate ellipsis resolution and scope underspecification (Crouch, 1995; Egg et al., 2001) in that application processes like anaphora resolution do not require full disambiguation but can work directly on the underspecified representation.

Therefore, underspecification of scope ambiguities is an important prerequisite for efficientprocessing. Many tasks, like ellipsis resolution or anaphora resolution, are arguably best performed on a representation with fixed scope order. An underspecification formalism should support execution of these tasks. This paper aims to upgrade an existing underspecification formalism for scope ambiguities, UnderspecifiedDiscourse Representation Theory (UDRT) (Reyle, 1993), so that both ellipsis and anaphora resolution can work on the underspecified structures.","","Many thanks for discussion and motivation are due to the colleagues in Saarbrücken.","Several proposals have been made in the literature on how to integrate scope underspecification and ellipsis resolution in a single formalism, e.g. Quasi-Logical Forms (QLF) (Crouch, 1995) and the Constraint Language for Lambda Structures (CLLS) (Egg et al., 2001). That work has primarily aimed at devising methods to untangle quantifier scoping and ellipsis resolution which often in-teract closely (see Section 6). To this end, descrip-tion languages have been modelled in which the disambiguation steps of a derivation need not be executed but rather can be explicitly recorded as constraints on the final structure. Constraints are only evaluated when the underspecified representation is finally interpreted. In contrast, UDRT aims at providing a representation formalism that supports interpretation processes such as theorem proving and anaphora resolution. Understood in this sense, underspecification often obviates the need for complete disambiguation. Another consequence is, how-ever, that the strategy of postponing disambiguation steps is in some cases insufficient. A case in point is the phenomenon dubbed Missing Antecedents by Grinder and Postal (1971), illustrated in sentence (1): One of the pronoun’s antecedents is overt, the other is supplied by ellipsis resolution.","(1) Harry sank a destroyer","and so did Bill and","they","","both went down with all hands. (Grinder","and Postal, 1971, 279) Most approaches to ellipsis and anaphora resolution, e.g. (Asher, 1993; Crouch, 1995; Egg et al., 2001), can readily derive the reading. But consider:","(2) Harry sometimes reads a book about a seabattle and so does Bill. They borrow those books from the library. Computational Linguistics (ACL), Philadelphia, July 2002, pp. 72-79. Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for Example (2) still retains five readings (Are there two or even more books? are there one, two, or more than two sea-battles?). An underspecified representation should not be committed to any of these readings, but it should specify that “ a book” has narrow scope with respect to the conjunction. Furthermore, an approach to underspecification and ellipsis resolution should make clear why this representation is to be constructed for the discourse (2). While QLF fails the first requirement (a single representation), CLLS fails the second (triggers for construction).","(3) * A destroyer went down in some battle and a","cruiser did too. Harry sank both destroyers","",". The discourse in (3) is not well-formed. But none of the approaches mentioned can ascertain this fact without complete scope resolution (or ad-hoc restrictions).","The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a short introduction to UDRT. Section 3 formulates the general setup of ellipsis resolution assumed in the rest of the paper. Section 4 presents a proposal to deal with scope parallelism in an underspecified representation. Section 5 shows how ellipsis can be treated if it is contained in its antecedent. Section 6 describes a way to model the interaction of ellipsis resolution and scope resolution in an underspecified structure. In section 7 strict and sloppy identity is discussed. Section 8 concludes."]},{"title":"2 Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures","paragraphs":["Reyle (1993) proposes a formalism for underspecification of scope ambiguity. The underspecified representations are called Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures (UDRSs). Completely specified UDRSs correspond to the Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs) of Kamp and Reyle (1993). A UDRS is a triple consisting of a top label, a set of labelled conditions or discourse referents, and a set of subordination constraints. A UDRS is (partially) disambiguated by adding subordination constraints. A UDRS must, however, always comply with the following well-formedness conditions: (1) It does not contain cycles (subordination is a partial order). (2) No label is subordinated to two labels which are siblings, i.e. part of the same complex condition (subordination is a tree order).","Figure 1 shows the UDRS for sentence 4 in formal and graph representation.

To bind an anaphor","to some antecedent expression",", a binding constraint (","","","","",") and an equality constraint between two discourse referents are introduced. Binding constraints are interpreted as equality in the subordination order. Any unbound presuppositions remaining after anaphora resolution (corresponding to accessibility constraints without binding constraints) are accommodated, i.e. they end up in an accessible scope position which is as near to the top as possible. Figure 2 shows the UDRS for sentence (5). Accessibility constraints are marked by broken lines, binding constraints are shown as squiggles.

Dalrymple et al. (1991) distinguish two tasks in ellipsis resolution:","1. determining parallelism, i.e. identifying the source clause ","(the antecedent of the ellipsis), the parallel elements in the source clause        , the parallel elements in the target","(i.e. elliptical) clause     , and the non-","parallel elements in the target ","","   ",",","2. interpreting the elliptical (target) clause","",", given the interpretation of                . The paper does not have much to say about task 1. Rather, some “parallelism” module is assumed to take care of task 1. This module determines the UDRS representations of the source clause and of the source and target parallel elements. It also provides a bijective function","associating the parallel labels and discourse referents in source and target.","For task 2 we adopt the substitutional approach advocated by Crouch (1995): The semantic representation of the target","","is a copy of the source ","where target parallel elements have been","substituted for source parallel elements (","","        ","   ","",").

We","talk about a sequence here, because, as sentence (7)","shows, ellipses may be nested.","(7) John arrived before the teacher did (1 arrive), and Bill did too (2 arrive before the teacher did (1 arrive)). For the implementation of classes, we take our cues from Prolog (Erbach, 1995; Mellish, 1988). In Prolog, class membership is most efficiently tested via unification. For unification to work, the class members must be represented as instances of the representation of the class. If class members are mutually exclusive, their representations must have different constants at some argument position. In this vein, we can think of a label as a Prolog term whose functor denotes the equivalence class and whose argument describes the sequence of ellipsis resolutions that generated the label. Such a sequence can be modelled as a list of numbers which denote resolutions of particular ellipses. An empty list indicates that the label was generated directly by semantic construction. We will call the list of resolution numbers associated with a label the label’s context. For reasons that will become clear only in section 7 discourse referents also have contexts. Although subordination constraints connect classes of labels, they are always evaluated in a particular context.

(11) John greeted every person that Bill did. In this case the quantifier embedding the elliptical clause necessarily takes scope over the source. The treatment of this phenomenon in QLF and CLLS, which consists in checking for cyclic formulae after scope resolution, cannot be transferred to UDRT, since it presupposes resolved scope. Rather we make a distinction between proposed source and actual source. If the target is not contained in the (proposed) source, the actual source is the proposed source. Otherwise, the actual source is definedto be that part of the proposed source which is potentially subordinated2","by the nuclear scope of the quantifier whose restriction contains the target."]},{"title":"6 Interaction of Ellipsis Resolution and QuantifierScoping","paragraphs":["Sentence (6) has a third reading in which the indefinite NP “ a solution” is raised out of the source clause and gets wide scope over the conjunction. In this case, the quantifier itself is not copied, only the bound variables which remain in the source. Generally, a quantifier that may or may not be raised out of the source is only copied if it gets scope in-side the source. Thus the exact determination of the semantic material to be copied (i.e. of the source) is dependent on scope decisions. Consequently, in an approach working on fully specified representations (Dalrymple et al., 1991) scope resolution cannot simply precede ellipsis resolution but rather is interleaved with it. Crouch (1995) considers order-sensitivity of interpretation a serious drawback. In his approach, underspecified formulae are copied in ellipsis resolution. In such formulae, quantifiers are not expressed directly but rather stored in “q-terms”. Q-terms are interpreted as bound variables. Quantifiers are introduced into interpreted structure only when their scope is resolved. Since scope resolution is seen as constraining the structure rather than as an operation of its own, the QLF approach manages to","2"," is potentially subordinated to  in a UDRS iff the subordination constraint   ","","could be added to the UDRS without violating well-formedness conditions. untangle scope resolution and ellipsis resolution. In CLLS (Egg et al., 2001) no copy is made in the underspecified representation. In both approaches, the quantifieris not copied until scope resolution.","But the Missing Antecedents phenomenon (1) shows that a copy of the quantifier must be available even before scope resolution so that it can serve as antecedent. But this copy may evaporate later on when more is known about the scope configura-tion. We will call conditions that possibly evaporate phantom conditions. For their implementation we make use of the fact that a UDRS collects labelled conditions and subordination constraints in sets. In sets, identical elements collapse. Thus, a condition that is completely identical to another condition will vanish in a UDRS. Phantom conditions only arise by parallelism; hence they are identical to their originals but for the context of their labels and discourse referents. To capture the effect of possible evapora-tion, it suffices to make the update of context in a phantom condition dependent on the relevant scope decision. To implement phantom conditions in a Prolog-style environment, we insert a meta-variable in place of the context and control its instantiation by a special constraint expressing the dependence on the pertinent subordination constraint (a conditional constraint).
