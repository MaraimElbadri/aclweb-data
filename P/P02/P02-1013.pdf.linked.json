Recently however, several papers made a step in that direction. (van Deemter, 2001) showed how to extend the basic Dale and Reiter Algorithm (Dale and Reiter, 1995) to generate plural definite descriptions using not just conjunctions of positive properties but also negative and disjunctive properties; (Stone, 1998) integrates the D&R algorithm into the surface realisation process and (Stone, 2000) extends it to deal with collective and distributive plural NPs.","Notably, in all three cases, the incremental structure of the D&R’s algorithm is preserved: the algorithm increments a set of properties till this set uniquely identifies the target set i.e., the set of objects to be described. As (Garey and Johnson, 1979) shows, such an incremental algorithm while being polynomial (and this, together with certain psycholinguistic observations, was one of the primary motivation for privileging this incremental strategy) is not guaranteed to find the minimal solution i.e., the description which uniquely identifies the target set using the smallest number of atomic properties.","In this paper, I argue that this characteristic of the incremental algorithm while reasonably innocuous when generating singular definite descriptions using only conjunctions of positive properties, renders it Computational Linguistics (ACL), Philadelphia, July 2002, pp. 96-103. Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for cognitively inappropriate when generalised to sets of individuals and disjunctive properties. I present an alternative approach which always produce the minimal description thereby avoiding the shortcomings of the incremental algorithm. I conclude by comparing the proposed approach with related proposals and giving pointers for further research."]},{"title":"2 The incremental approach","paragraphs":["Dale and Reiter’s incremental algorithm (cf. Figure 1) iterates through the properties of the target entity (the entity to be described) selecting a property, adding it to the description being built and computing the distractor set i.e., the set of elements for which the conjunction of properties selected so far holds. The algorithm succeeds (and returns the selected properties) when the distractor set is the singleton set containing the target entity. It fails if all properties of the target entity have been selected and the distractor set contains more than the target entity (i.e. there is no distinguishing description for the target).","This basic algorithm can be refined by ordering properties according to some fixed preferences and thereby selecting first e.g., some base level category in a taxonomy, second a size attribute third, a colour attribute etc.  : the domain; , the set of properties of","; To generate the UID  , do:","1.

By definition, these will never be redundant nor will they be unnecessarily long and ambiguous.","As (Dale and Reiter, 1995) shows, the problem of finding minimal distinguishing descriptions can be formulated as a set cover problem and is therefore known to be NP hard. However, given an efficient implementation this might not be a hindrance in practice. The alternative algorithm I propose is therefore based on the use of constraint programming (CP), a paradigm aimed at efficiently solving NP hard combinatoric problems such as scheduling and optimization. Instead of following a generate-and-test strategy which might result in an intractable search space, CP minimises the search space by following a propagate-and-distribute strategy where propagation draws inferences on the basis of efficient, deterministic inference rules and distribution performs a case distinction for a variable value. The basic version. Consider the definition of a distinguishing description given in (Dale and Reiter, 1995). Let","be the intended referent, and","be the distractor set; then, a set","of attribute-value pairs will represent a distinguishing description if the following two conditions hold:","C1: Every attribute-value pair in","applies to",": that is, every element of  specifies an attribute value that possesses.","C2: For every member","of",", there is at least one element","of","that does not apply to",": that is, there is an","in that specifies an attribute-value that does not possess.","is said to rule out  . The constraints (cf. Figure 7) used in the proposed algorithm directly mirror this definition.

Additionally, a distribution strategy needs to be made precise which specifies how to search for solutions i.e., for assignments of values to variables such that all constraints are simultaneously verified.

This is because, as the following example from (Stone and Webber, 1998) illustrates, the information used to uniquely identify some object need not be localised to a definite description. (2) Remove the rabbit from the hat.","In a context where there are several rabbits and several hats but only one rabbit in a hat (and only one hat containing a rabbit), the sentence in (2) is sufficient to identify the rabbit that is in the hat. In this case thus, it is the presupposition of the verb “remove” which ensures this: since x remove y from z presupposes that","was in","before the action, we can infer from (2) that the rabbit talked about is indeed the rabbit that is in the hat.","The solution proposed in (Stone and Webber, 1998) and implemented in the SPUD (Sentence Planning Using Descriptions) generator is to integrate surface realisation and DD computation. As a property true of the target set is selected, the corresponding lexical entry is integrated in the phrase structure tree being built to satisfy the given communicative goals. Generation ends when the resulting tree (i) satisfies all communicative goals and (ii) is syntactically complete. In particular, the goal of describing some discourse old entity using a definite description is satisfied as soon as the given information (i.e. information shared by speaker and hearer) associated by the grammar with the tree suffices to uniquely identify this object.","Similarly, the constraint-based algorithm for generating DD presented here has been integrated with surface realisation within the generator INDIGEN (http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/ cl/projects/indigen.html) as follows.","As in SPUD, the generation process is driven by the communicative goals and in particular, by in-forming and describing goals. In practice, these goals contribute to updating a “goal semantics” which the generator seeks to realise by building a phrase structure tree that (i) realises that goal semantics, (ii) is syntactically complete and (iii) is pragmatically appropriate.","Specifically, if an entity must be described which is discourse old, a DD will be computed for that entity and added to the current goal semantics thereby driving further generation.","Like SPUD, this modified version of the SPUD algorithm can account for the fact that a DD need not be wholy realised within the corresponding NP – as a DD is added to the goal semantics, it guides the lexical lookup process (only items in the lexicon whose semantics subsumes part of the goal semantics are selected) but there is no restriction on how the given semantic information is realised.","Unlike SPUD however, the INDIGEN generator does not follow an incremental greedy search strategy mirroring the incremental D&R algorithm (at each step in the generation process, SPUD compares all possible continuations and only pursues the best one; There is no backtracking). It follows a chart based strategy instead (Striegnitz, 2001) producing all possible paraphrases. The drawback is of course a loss in efficiency. The advantages on the other hand are twofold.","First, INDIGEN only generates definite descriptions that realize minimal DD. Thus unlike SPUD, it will not run into the problems mentioned in section 2 once generalised to negative and disjunctive properties.","Second, if there is no DD for a given entity, this will be immediately noticed in the present approach thus allowing for a non definite NP or a quantifier to be constructed instead. In contrast, SPUD will, if unconstrained, keep adding material to the tree until all properties of the object to be described have been realised. Once all properties have been realised and since there is no backtracking, generation will fail. N-ary relations. The set variables used in our constraints solver are variables ranging over sets of integers. This, in effect, means that prior to applying constraints, the algorithm will perform an encoding of the objects being constrained – individuals and properties – into (pairwise distinct) integers. It follows that the algorithm easily generalises to n-ary relations. Just like the proposition red(",") using the unary-relation “red” can be encoded by an integer, so can the proposition on(","","","",") using the binary-relation “on” be encoded by two integers (one for on(",") and one for on(",").","Thus the present algorithm improves on (van Deemter, 2001) which is restricted to unary relations. It also differs from (Krahmer et al., 2001), who use graphs and graph algorithms for computing DDs – while graphs provides a transparent encoding of unary and binary relations, they lose much of their intuitive appeal when applied to relations of higher arity.","It is also worth noting that the infinite regress problem observed (Dale and Haddock, 1991) to hold for the D&R algorithm (and similarly for its van Deemter’s generalisation) when extended to deal with binary relations, does not hold in the present approach.","In the D&R algorithm, the problem stems from the fact that DD are generated recursively: if when generating a DD for some entity",", a relation","is selected which relates","to e.g.,",", the D&R algorithm will recursively go on to produce a DD for ",". Without additional restriction, the algorithm can thus loop forever, first describing","in terms of",", then","in terms of",", then","in terms of","etc.","The solution adopted by (Dale and Haddock, 1991) is to stipulate that facts from the knowledge base can only be used once within a given call to the algorithm.","In contrast, the solution follows, in the present algorithm (as in SPUD), from its integration with surface realisation. Suppose for instance, that the initial goal is to describe the discourse old entity",". The initially empty goal semantics will be updated with its DD say,",". NP D the N","Goal Semantics =  ","","","This information is then used to select appropriate lexical entries i.e., the noun entry for “bowl” and the preposition entry for “on”. The resulting tree (with leaves “the bowl on”) is syntactically incomplete hence generation continues attempting to provide a description for",". If","is discourse old, the lexical entry for the will be selected and a DD computed say,",". This then is added to the current goal semantics yielding the goal semantics","which is compared with the semantics of the tree built so far i..e., ",". NP D the N N bowl PP P on NP D the N","Goal Semantics =","","  ","","","Tree Semantics =  ","","","Since goal and tree semantics are different, generation continue selecting the lexical entry for “table” and integrating it in the tree being built. NP D the N N bowl PP P on NP D the N table","Goal Semantics =","","  ","","","Tree Semantics =","","  ","","","At this stage, the semantics of that tree is ","which is equivalent to the goal semantics. Since furthermore the tree is syntactically and pragmatically complete, generation stops yielding the NP the bowl on the table.","In sum, infinite regress is avoided by using the computed DDs to control the addition of new material to the tree being built. Minimality and overspecified descriptions. It has often been observed that human beings produce overspecified i.e., non-minimal descriptions. One might therefore wonder whether generating minimal descriptions is in fact appropriate. Two points speak for it.","First, it is unclear whether redundant information is present because of a cognitive artifact (e.g., incremental processing) or because it helps fulfill some other communicative goal besides identification. So for instance, (Jordan, 1999) shows that in a specific task context, redundant attributes are used to indicate the violation of a task constraint (for instance, when violating a colour constraint, a task participant will use the description “the red table” rather than “the table” to indicate that s/he violates a constraint to the effect that red object may not be used at that stage of the task).","More generally, it seems unlikely that no rule at all governs the presence of redundant information in definite descriptions. If redundant descriptions are to be produced, they should therefore be produced in relation to some general principle (i.e., because the algorithm goes through a fixed order of attribute classes or because the redundant information fulfills a particular communicative goal) not randomly, as is done in the generalised incremental algorithm.","Second, the psycholinguistic literature bearing on the presence of redundant information in definite descriptions has mainly been concerned with unary atomic relations. Again once binary, ternary and disjunctive relations are considered, it is unclear that the phenomenon generalises. As (Krahmer et al., 2001) observed, “it is unlikely that someone would describe an object as “the dog next to the tree in front of the garage” in a situation where “the dog next to the tree” would suffice. Implementation. The ideas presented in this paper have been implemented within the generator INDIGEN using the concurrent constraint programming language Oz (Programming Systems Lab Saarbrücken, 1998) which supports set variables ranging over finite sets of integers and provides an efficient implementation of the associated constraint theory. The proof-of-concept implementation in-cludes the constraint solver described in section 4 and its integration in a chart-based generator integrating surface realisation and inference. For the examples discussed in this paper, the constraint solver returns the minimal solution (i.e., The cat and the dog and The poodle, the Jersey, the pitbul and the Holstein) in 80 ms and 1.4 seconds respectively. The integration of the constraint solver within the generator permits realising definite NPs including negative information (the cat that is not white) and simple conjunctions (The cat and the dog)."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["One area that deserves further investigation is the relation to surface realisation. Once disjunctive and negative relations are used, interesting questions arise as to how these should be realised. How should conjunctions, disjunctions and negations be realised within the sentence? How are they realised in practice? and how can we impose the appropriate constraints so as to predict linguistically and cognitively acceptable structures? More generally, there is the question of which communicative goals refer to sets rather than just individuals and of the relationship to what in the generation literature has been baptised “aggregation” roughly, the grouping together of facts exhibiting various degrees and forms of similarity."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["I thank Denys Duchier for implementing the basic constraint solver on which this paper is based and Marilisa Amoia for implementing the extension to disjunctive relations and integrating the constraint solver into the INDIGEN generator.
