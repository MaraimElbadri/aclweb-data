Despite bounded memory they are well-suited to describe many linguistic and textual processes, either exactly or approximately.","A relation is a set of (input; output) pairs. Relations are more general than functions because they may pair a given input string with more or fewer than one output string.","The class of so-called rational relations admits a nice declarative programming paradigm. Source code describing the relation (a regular expression) is compiled into efficient object code (in the form of a 2-tape automaton called a finite-state transducer). The object code can even be optimized for runtime and code size (via algorithms such as determinization and minimization of transducers).","This programming paradigm supports efficient nondeterminism, including parallel processing over infinite sets of input strings, and even allows “reverse” computation from output to input. Its unusual flexibility for the practiced programmer stems from the many operations under which rational relations are closed. It is common to define further useful operations (as macros), which modify existing relations not by editing their source code but simply by operating on them “from outside.”","","A brief version of this work, with some additional material, first appeared as (Eisner, 2001a). A leisurely journal-length version with more details has been prepared and is available.","The entire paradigm has been generalized to weighted relations, which assign a weight to each (input; output) pair rather than simply including or excluding it. If these weights represent probabilities P (input; output) or P (output j input), the weighted relation is called a joint or conditional (probabilistic) relation and constitutes a statistical model. Such models can be efficiently restricted, manipulated or combined using rational operations as before. An artificial example will appear in x2.","The availability of toolkits for this weighted case (Mohri et al., 1998; van Noord and Gerdemann, 2001) promises to unify much of statistical NLP. Such tools make it easy to run most current approaches to statistical markup, chunking, normalization, segmentation, alignment, and noisy-channel decoding,1","including classic models for speech recognition (Pereira and Riley, 1997) and machine translation (Knight and Al-Onaizan, 1998). More-over, once the models are expressed in the finite-state framework, it is easy to use operators to tweak them, to apply them to speech lattices or other sets, and to combine them with linguistic resources.","Unfortunately, there is a stumbling block: Where do the weights come from? After all, statistical models require supervised or unsupervised training. Currently, finite-state practitioners derive weights using exogenous training methods, then patch them onto transducer arcs. Not only do these methods require additional programming outside the toolkit, but they are limited to particular kinds of models and training regimens. For example, the forward-backward algorithm (Baum, 1972) trains only Hidden Markov Models, while (Ristad and Yianilos, 1996) trains only stochastic edit distance.","In short, current finite-state toolkits include no training algorithms, because none exist for the large space of statistical models that the toolkits can in principle describe and run.","1","Given output, find input to maximize P (input; output).

It lays out a fully general approach for training the weights of weighted rational relations. First x2 considers how to parameterize such models, so that weights are defined in terms of underlying parameters to be learned. x3 asks what it means to learn these parameters from training data (what is to be optimized?), and notes the apparently formidable bookkeeping involved. x4 cuts through the difficulty with a surprisingly simple trick. Finally, x5 removes inefficiencies from the basic algorithm, making it suitable for inclusion in an actual toolkit. Such a toolkit could greatly shorten the development cycle in natural language engineering."]},{"title":"2 Transducers and Parameters","paragraphs":["Finite-state machines, including finite-state automata (FSAs) and transducers (FSTs), are a kind of labeled directed multigraph. For ease and brevity, we explain them by example. Fig. 1a shows a probabilistic FST with input alphabet = fa; bg, output alphabet = fx; zg, and all states final. It may be regarded as a device for generating a string pair in","","by a random walk from 0 . Two paths exist that generate both input aabb and output xz:","0 a:x=:63 ! 0 a:=: 07 ! 1 b:=: 03 ! 2 b:z=:4 ! 2/.5","0 a:x=:63 ! 0 a:=: 07 ! 1 b:z=:12 ! 2 b:=: 1 ! 2/.5 Each of the paths has probability .0002646, so the probability of somehow generating the pair (aabb; xz) is :0002646 + :0002646 = :0005292.","Abstracting away from the idea of random walks, arc weights need not be probabilities. Still, define a path’s weight as the product of its arc weights and the stopping weight of its final state. Thus Fig. 1a defines a weighted relation f where f (aabb; xz) = :0005292. This particular relation does happen to be probabilistic (see x1). It represents a joint distribution (since P","x;y f (x; y) = 1). Meanwhile, Fig. 1c","defines a conditional one (8x","P","y f (x; y) = 1).","This paper explains how to adjust probability distributions like that of Fig. 1a so as to model training data better. The algorithm improves an FST’s numeric weights while leaving its topology fixed.","How many parameters are there to adjust in Fig. 1a? That is up to the user who built it! An FST model with few parameters is more constrained, making optimization easier. Some possibilities: Most simply, the algorithm can be asked to tune the 17 numbers in Fig. 1a separately, subject to the constraint that the paths retain total probability 1. A more specific version of the constraint requires the FST to remain Markovian: each of the 4 states must present options with total probability 1 (at state 1 , 15+.7+.03.+.12=1). This preserves the random-walk interpretation and (we will show) entails no loss of generality. The 4 restrictions leave 13 free params. But perhaps Fig. 1a was actually obtained as the composition of Fig. 1b–c, effectively defining P (input; output) =","P","mid P (input; mid) P (output j mid). If Fig. 1b–c are required to remain Markovian, they have 5 and 1 degrees of freedom respectively, so now Fig. 1a has only 6 parameters total.2","In general, composing machines multiplies their arc counts but only adds their parameter counts. We wish to optimize just the few underlying parameters, not independently optimize the many arc weights of the composed machine.

With = :1 from footnote 2, the composed machine","2","Why does Fig. 1c have only 1 degree of freedom? The Markovian requirement means something different in Fig. 1c, which defines a conditional relation P (output j mid) rather than a joint one. A random walk on Fig. 1c chooses among arcs with a given input label. So the arcs from state 6 with input p must have total probability 1 (currently .9+.1). All other arc choices are forced by the input label and so have probability 1. The only tunable value is .1 (denote it by ), with :9 = 1 .

Each of these probabilities in turn affects multiple arcs in the composed FST of Fig. 1a.","We offer a theorem that highlights the broad applicability of these modeling techniques.4","If f (input; output) is a weighted regular relation, then the following statements are equivalent: (1) f is a joint probabilistic relation; (2) f can be computed by a Markovian FST that halts with probability 1; (3) f can be expressed as a probabilistic regexp, i.e., a regexp built up from atomic expressions a : b (for a 2 [ f g; b 2 [ f g) using concatenation, probabilistic union +p, and probabilistic closure p.","For defining conditional relations, a good regexp language is unknown to us, but they can be defined in several other ways: (1) via FSTs as in Fig. 1c, (2) by compilation of weighted rewrite rules (Mohri and Sproat, 1996), (3) by compilation of decision trees (Sproat and Riley, 1996), (4) as a relation that performs contextual left-to-right replacement of input substrings by a smaller conditional relation (Gerdemann and van Noord, 1999),5","(5) by conditionaliza-tion of a joint relation as discussed below.","A central technique is to define a joint relation as a noisy-channel model, by composing a joint relation with a cascade of one or more conditional relations as in Fig. 1 (Pereira and Riley, 1997; Knight and Graehl, 1998). The general form is illustrated by","3","Conceptually, the parameters represent the probabilities of reading another a ( ); reading another b ( ); transducing b to p rather than q ( ); starting to transduce p to rather than x ( ).","4","To prove (1))(3), express f as an FST and apply the well-known Kleene-Schützenberger construction (Berstel and Reutenauer, 1988), taking care to write each regexp in the construction as a constant times a probabilistic regexp.

Arbitrary weights such as 2.7 may be assigned to arcs or sprinkled through a regexp (to be compiled into",":= 2:7","! arcs). A more subtle example is weighted FSAs that approximate PCFGs (Nederhof, 2000; Mohri and Nederhof, 2001), or to extend the idea, weighted FSTs that approximate joint or conditional synchronous PCFGs built for translation. These are parameterized by the PCFG’s parameters, but add or remove strings of the PCFG to leave an improper probability distribution.","Fortunately for those techniques, an FST with positive arc weights can be normalized to make it jointly or conditionally probabilistic: An easy approach is to normalize the options at each state to make the FST Markovian. Unfortunately, the result may differ for equivalent FSTs that express the same weighted relation. Undesirable consequences of this fact have been termed “label bias” (Lafferty et al., 2001). Also, in the conditional case such per-state normalization is only correct if all states accept all input suffixes (since “dead ends” leak probability mass).8 A better-founded approach is global normalization, which simply divides each f (x; y) byP","x0",";y0 f (x0","; y0",") (joint case) or by P","y0 f (x; y0",") (conditional case). To implement the joint case, just divide stopping weights by the total weight of all paths (which x4 shows how to find), provided this is finite. In the conditional case, let g be a copy of f with the output labels removed, so that g(x) finds the desired divisor; determinize g if possible (but this fails for some weighted FSAs), replace all weights with their reciprocals, and compose the result with f .9","6","P (w; x) defines the source model, and is often an “identity FST” that requires w = x, really just an FSA.","7","We propose also using n-tape automata to generalize to “branching noisy channels” (a case of dendroid distributions).

Here one defines each arc weight, coin weight, or regexp weight in terms of meaningful features associated by hand with that arc, coin, etc. Each feature has a strength 2 R>0, and a weight is computed as the product of the strengths of its features.10","It is now the strengths that are the learnable parameters. This allows meaningful parameter tying: if certain arcs such as u:i !, o:e !, and","a:ae","! share a contextual “vowel-fronting” feature, then their weights rise and fall together with the strength of that feature. The resulting machine must be normalized, either per-state or globally, to obtain a joint or a conditional distribution as desired. Such approaches have been tried recently in restricted cases (McCallum et al., 2000; Eisner, 2001b; Lafferty et al., 2001).","Normalization may be postponed and applied instead to the result of combining the FST with other FSTs by composition, union, concatenation, etc. A simple example is a probabilistic FSA defined by normalizing the intersection of other probabilistic FSAs f1; f2; : : :.

In the extreme, if each input string is fully observed (not the case if the input is bound by composition to the output of a one-to-many FST), one can succeed by restricting g to each input string in turn; this amounts to manually dividing f(x; y) by g(x).","10","Traditionally log(strength) values are called weights, but this paper uses “weight” to mean something else. 8 9a:x/.63","10a:x/.63 11b:x/.027 a: /.7e","b: /.0051e 12/.5b:z/.1284 b: /.1e b:z/.404 b: /.1e Figure 2: The joint model of Fig. 1a constrained to generate only input 2 a(a + b)","and output = xxz. f on demand (Mohri et al., 1998) can pay off here, since only part of f may be needed subsequently.)","As training data we are given a set of observed (input; output) pairs, (xi; yi).

Roughly, the E step guesses hidden information: if (xi; yi) was generated from the current f , which FST paths stand a chance of having been the path used? (Guessing the path also guesses the exact input and output.) The M step updates to make those paths more likely. EM alternates these steps and converges to a local optimum. The M step’s form depends on the parameterization and the E step serves the M step’s needs.","Let f be Fig. 1a and suppose (xi; yi) = (a(a + b)","; xxz). During the E step, we restrict to paths compatible with this observation by computing xi f yi, shown in Fig. 2. To find each path’s posterior probability given the observation (xi; yi), just conditionalize: divide its raw probability by the total probability ( 0:1003) of all paths in Fig. 2. 11","To implement an HMM by an FST, compose a probabilistic FSA that generates a state sequence of the HMM with a conditional FST that transduces HMM states to emitted symbols.","But that is not the full E step.

Crucially, x4 will show how the E step can accumulate these counts effortlessly. We first explain their use by the M step, repeating the presentation of x2: If the parameters are the 17 weights in Fig. 1a, the M step reestimates the probabilities of the arcs from each state to be proportional to the expected number of traversals of each arc (normalizing at each state to make the FST Markovian).

(Any parameters of g may be either frozen before training or optimized along with the parameters of f .) A final possibility is that each xi is defined by a probabilistic FSA that already supplies a distribution over the inputs; then we consider xi f yi directly, just as in the joint model.","Finally, note that EM is not all-purpose.

If n and m are the number of states and edges,19","then both problems are O(n3",") in the worst case, but the single-source version can be solved in essentially O(m) time for acyclic graphs and other reducible flow graphs (Tarjan, 1981b). For a general graph Ti, Tarjan (1981b) shows how to partition into “hard” subgraphs that localize the cyclicity or irreducibility, then run the O(n3",") algorithm on each subgraph (thereby reducing n to as little as 1), and recombine the results. The overhead of partitioning and recombining is essentially only O(m). For speeding up the O(n3",") problem on subgraphs, one can use an approximate relaxation technique","17","Eisner (submitted) develops fast minimization algorithms that work for the real and V -expectation semirings.","18","Division and subtraction are also possible: (p; v) = (p; v) and (p; v)1","= (p1","; p1","vp1","). Division is commonly used in defining f (for normalization).","19","Multiple edges from j to k are summed into a single edge. (Mohri, 2002). Efficient hardware implementation is also possible via chip-level parallelism (Rote, 1985). In many cases of interest, Ti is an acyclic graph.20 Then Tarjan’s method computes w0j for each j in topologically sorted order, thereby finding ti in a linear number of and operations. For HMMs (footnote 11), Ti is the familiar trellis, and we would like this computation of ti to reduce to the forward-backward algorithm (Baum, 1972). But notice that it has no backward pass. In place of pushing cumulative probabilities backward to the arcs, it pushes cumulative arcs (more generally, values in V ) forward to the probabilities. This is slower because our and are vector operations, and the vectors rapidly lose sparsity as they are added together. We therefore reintroduce a backward pass that lets us avoid and when computing ti (so they are needed only to construct Ti). This speedup also works for cyclic graphs and for any V . Write wjk as (pjk; vjk), and let w1","jk = (p1","jk; v1","jk) denote the weight of the edge from j to k.19","Then it can be shown that w0n = (p0n;","P","j;k p0jv1","jkpkn). The forward and backward probabilities, p0j and pkn, can be computed using single-source algebraic path for the simpler semiring (R; +; ;",")—or equivalently, by solving a sparse linear system of equations over R, a much-studied problem at O(n) space, O(nm) time, and faster approximations (Greenbaum, 1997). A Viterbi variant of the expectation semiring exists: replace (3) with if(p1 > p2; (p1; v1); (p2; v2)). Here, the forward and backward probabilities can be computed in time only O(m + n log n) (Fredman and Tarjan, 1987). k-best variants are also possible."]},{"title":"6 Discussion","paragraphs":["We have exhibited a training algorithm for parameterized finite-state machines. Some specific consequences that we believe to be novel are (1) an EM algorithm for FSTs with cycles and epsilons; (2) training algorithms for HMMs and weighted contextual edit distance that work on incomplete data; (3) end-to-end training of noisy channel cascades, so that it is not necessary to have separate training data for each machine in the cascade (cf. Knight and Graehl,","20","If xi and yi are acyclic (e.g., fully observed strings), and f (or rather its FST) has no : cycles, then composition will “unroll” f into an acyclic machine. If only xi is acyclic, then the composition is still acyclic if domain(f) has no cycles. 1998), although such data could also be used; (4) training of branching noisy channels (footnote 7); (5) discriminative training with incomplete data; (6) training of conditional MEMMs (McCallum et al., 2000) and conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) on unbounded sequences.","We are particularly interested in the potential for quickly building statistical models that incorporate linguistic and engineering insights. Many models of interest can be constructed in our paradigm, without having to write new code. Bringing diverse models into the same declarative framework also allows one to apply new optimization methods, objective functions, and finite-state algorithms to all of them.","To avoid local maxima, one might try deterministic annealing (Rao and Rose, 2001), or randomized methods, or place a prior on . Another extension is to adjust the machine topology, say by model merging (Stolcke and Omohundro, 1994). Such techniques build on our parameter estimation method.","The key algorithmic ideas of this paper extend from forward-backward-style to inside-outside-style methods. For example, it should be possible to do end-to-end training of a weighted relation defined by an interestingly parameterized synchronous CFG composed with tree transducers and then FSTs."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["L.
