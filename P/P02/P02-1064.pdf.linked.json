We use Japanese word segmentation as a test case. In particular, we discuss how the size of a pool affects the learning curve. It is found that in the early stage of training with a larger pool, more labeled examples are required to achieve a given level of accuracy than those with a smaller pool. In addition, we propose a novel technique to use a large number of unlabeled examples effectively by adding them gradually to a pool. The experimental results show that our technique requires less labeled examples than those with the technique in previous research. To achieve 97.0 % accuracy, the proposed technique needs 59.3 % of labeled examples that are required when using the previous technique and only 17.4 % of labeled examples with random sampling."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Corpus-based supervised learning is now a standard approach to achieve high-performance in natural language processing. However, the weakness of supervised learning approach is to need an annotated corpus, the size of which is reasonably large. Even if we have a good supervised-learning method, we cannot get high-performance without an annotated corpus. The problem is that corpus annotation is labour intensive and very expensive. In order to overcome this, some unsupervised learning methods and minimally-supervised methods, e.g., (Yarowsky, 1995; Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000), have been proposed. However, such methods usually depend on tasks or domains and their performance of-ten does not match one with a supervised learning method.","Another promising approach is active learning,in which a classifier selects examples to be labeled, and then requests a teacher to label them. It is very different from passive learning, in which a classifier gets labeled examples randomly. Active learning is a general framework and does not depend on tasks or domains. It is expected that active learning will reduce considerably manual annotation cost while keeping performance. However, few papers in the field of computational linguistics have focused on this approach (Dagan and Engelson, 1995; Thompson et al., 1999; Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000; Hwa, 2000; Banko and Brill, 2001). Although there are many active learning methods with various classifiers such as a probabilistic classifier (McCallum and Nigam, 1998), we focus on active learning with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) because of their performance.","The Support Vector Machine, which is introduced by Vapnik (1995), is a powerful new statistical learning method. Excellent performance is reported in hand-written character recognition, face detection, image classification, and so forth. SVMs have been recently applied to several natural language tasks, including text classification (Joachims, 1998; Dumais et al., 1998), chunking (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000b; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001), and dependency analysis (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000a). SVMs have been greatly successful in such tasks. Computational Linguistics (ACL), Philadelphia, July 2002, pp. 505-512. Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for Additionally, SVMs as well as boosting have good theoretical background.","The objective of our research is to develop an effective way to build a corpus and to create high-performance NL systems with minimal cost. As a first step, we focus on investigating how active learning with SVMs, which have demonstrated excellent performance, works for complex tasks in natural language processing. For text classification, it is found that this approach is effective (Tong and Koller, 2000; Schohn and Cohn, 2000). They used less than 10,000 binary features and less than 10,000 examples. However, it is not clear that the approach is readily applicable to tasks which have more than 100,000 features and more than 100,000 examples.","We use Japanese word segmentation as a test case. The task is suitable for our purpose because we have to handle combinations of more than 1,000 characters and a very large corpus (EDR, 1995) exists."]},{"title":"2 Support Vector Machines","paragraphs":["In this section we give some theoretical definitions of SVMs. Assume that we are given the training data","","","","","","","","","   ","","","","","","","","","","","","  ",""," The decision function","in SVM framework is defined as:","","","",""," ","","","","","(1)","   ","    ","","","","","   ","","","","","(2)","where","is a kernel function,","","","is a thresh-","old, and  are weights.

Figure 3: Outline of Tow Pool Algorithm 3.3 Two Pool Algorithm We observed in our experiments that when using the algorithm in the previous section, in the early stage of training, a classifier with a larger pool requires more examples than that with a smaller pool does (to be described in Section 5). In order to overcome the weakness, we propose two new algorithms. We call them “Two Pool Algorithm” generically. It has two pools, i.e., a primary pool and a secondary one, and moves gradually unlabeled examples to the primary pool from the secondary instead of using a large pool from the start of training. The primary pool is used directly for selection of examples which are requested a teacher to label, whereas the secondary is not. The basic idea is simple. Since we cannot get good performance when using a large pool at the beginning of training, we enlarge gradually a pool of unlabeled examples.","The outline of Two Pool Algorithm is shown in Figure 3. We describe below two variations, which are different in the condition at (d) in Figure 3.","Our first variation, which is called Two Pool Algorithm A, adds new unlabeled examples to the primary pool when the increasing ratio of support vectors in the current classifier decreases, because the gain of accuracy is very little once the ratio is down. This phenomenon is observed in our experiments (Section 5). This observation has also been reported in previous studies (Schohn and Cohn, 2000).","In Two Pool Algorithm we add new unlabeled examples so that the total number of examples including both labeled examples in the training set and unlabeled examples in the primary pool is doubled. For example, suppose that the size of a initial primary pool is 1,000 examples. Before starting training, there are no labeled examples and 1,000 unlabeled examples. We add 1,000 new unlabeled examples to the primary pool when the increasing ratio of support vectors is down after","examples has been labeled. Then, there are the","labeled examples and the (","","","","",") unlabeled examples in the primary pool. At the next time when we add new unlabeled examples, the number of newly added examples is 2,000 and then the total number of both labeled in the training set and unlabeled examples in the primary pool is 4,000.","Our second variation, which is called Two Pool Algorithm B, adds new unlabeled examples to the primary pool when the number of support vectors of the current classifier exceeds a threshold",".

When deciding how many unlabeled examples should be added to the primary pool, we use the strategy as described in the paragraph above."]},{"title":"4 Japanese Word Segmentation 4.1 Word Segmentation as a Classification Task","paragraphs":["Many tasks in natural language processing can be formulated as a classification task (van den Bosch","3","Since typically the percentage of support vectors is small (e.g., less than 30 %), we choose around 10 % for Æ",".

Table 2 shows the accuracy at different sizes of labeled examples.","Second, we changed the number of examples in a pool and ran the active learning algorithm in Section 3.2. We use the same examples for a pool as those used in the passive learning experiments. We selected 1,000 examples at each iteration of the active learning. Figure 4 shows the learning curve of this experiment and Figure 5 is a close-up of Figure 4. We see from Figure 4 that active learning works quite well and it significantly reduces labeled examples to be required. Let us see how many labeled examples are required to achieve 96.0 % accuracy. In active learning with the pool, the size of which is 2,500 sentences (97,349 examples), only 28,813 labeled examples are needed, whereas in passive learning, about 97,000 examples are required. That means over 70 % reduction is realized by active learning. In the case of 97 % accuracy, approximately the same percentage of reduction is realized when using the pool, the size of which is 20,000 sentences (776,586 examples).","Now let us see how the accuracy curve varies depending on the size of a pool. Surprisingly, the performance of a larger pool is worse than that of a smaller pool in the early stage of training5",". One reason for this could be that support vectors in selected examples at each iteration from a larger pool make larger clusters than those selected from a smaller pool do. In other words, in the case of a larger pool, more examples selected at each iteration would be similar to each other. We computed variances6","of each 1,000 selected examples at the learning iteration from 2 to 11 (Table 1). The variances of se-","5","Tong and Koller (2000) have got the similar results in a text classification task with two small pools: 500 and 1000.

The result is not inconsistent with our hypothesis.","Before we discuss the results of Two Pool Algorithm, we show in Figure 6 how support vectors of a classifier increase and the accuracy changes when using the 2,500 sentence size pool. It is clear that after the accuracy improvement almost stops, the increment of the number of support vectors is down. We also observed the same phenomenon with different sizes of pools. We utilize this phenomenon in Algorithm A.","Next, we ran Two Pool Algorithm A7",". The result is shown in Figure 7. The accuracy curve of Algorithm A is better than that of the previously proposed method at the number of labeled examples roughly up to 20,000. After that, however, the performance of Algorithm A does not clearly exceed that of the previous method.","The result of Algorithm B is shown in Figure 8.
