But lack of training data is a severe bottleneck for supervised systems due to the extensive labor and cost involved. Indeed, one of the main goals of the SENSEVAL exercises is to create large amounts of sense-annotated data for supervised systems (Kilgarriff&Rosenzweig, 2000). The problem is even more challenging for languages which possess scarce computer readable knowledge resources.","In this paper, we investigate the role of large amounts of noisily sense annotated data obtained using an unsupervised approach in relieving the data acquisition bottleneck for the WSD task. We bootstrap a supervised learning WSD system with an unsupervised seed set. We use the sense annotated data produced by Diab’s unsupervised system SALAAM (Diab&Resnik, 2002; Diab, 2003). SALAAM is a WSD system that exploits parallel corpora for sense disambiguation of words in running text. To date, SALAAM yields the best scores for an unsupervised system on the SENSEVAL2 English All-Words task (Diab, 2003). SALAAM is an appealing approach as it provides automatically sense annotated data in two languages simultaneously, thereby providing a multilingual framework for solving the data acquisition problem. For instance, SALAAM has been used to bootstrap the WSD process for Arabic as illustrated in (Diab, 2004).","In a supervised learning setting, WSD is cast as a classification problem, where a predefined set of sense tags constitutes the classes. The ambiguous words in text are assigned one or more of these classes by a machine learning algorithm based on some extracted features. This algorithm learns parameters from explicit associations between the class and the features, or combination of features, that characterize it. Therefore, such systems are very sensitive to the training data, and those data are, generally, assumed to be as clean as possible.","In this paper, we question that assumption. Can large amounts of noisily annotated data used in training be useful within such a learning paradigm for WSD? What is the nature of the quality-quantity trade-off in addressing this problem?"]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["To our knowledge, the earliest study of bootstrapping a WSD system with noisy data is by Gale et. al., (Gale et al. , 1992). Their investigation was limited in scale to six data items with two senses each and a bounded number of examples per test item.","Two more recent investigations are by Yarowsky, (Yarowsky, 1995), and later, Mihalcea, (Mihalcea, 2002). Each of the studies, in turn, addresses the is-sue of data quantity while maintaining good quality training examples. Both investigations present algorithms for bootstrapping supervised WSD systems using clean data based on a dictionary or an ontological resource. The general idea is to start with a clean initial seed and iteratively increase the seed size to cover more data.","Yarowsky starts with a few tagged instances to train a decision list approach. The initial seed is manually tagged with the correct senses based on entries in Roget’s Thesaurus. The approach yields very successful results — 95% — on a hand-ful of data items.","Mihalcea, on the other hand, bases the bootstrapping approach on a generation algorithm, GenCor (Mihalcea&Moldovan, 1999). GenCor creates seeds from monosemous words in WordNet, Semcor data, sense tagged examples from the glosses of polysemous words in WordNet, and other hand tagged data if available. This initial seed set is used for querying the Web for more examples and the retrieved contexts are added to the seed corpus. The words in the contexts of the seed words retrieved are then disambiguated. The disambiguated contexts are then used for querying the Web for yet more examples, and so on. It is an iterative algorithm that incrementally generates large amounts of sense tagged data. The words found are restricted to either part of noun compounds or internal arguments of verbs. Mihalcea’s supervised learning system is an instance-based-learning algorithm. In the study, Mihalcea compares results yielded by the supervised learning system trained on the automatically generated data, GenCor, against the same system trained on manually annotated data. She reports successful results on six of the data items tested."]},{"title":"3 Empirical Layout","paragraphs":["Similar to Mihalcea’s approach, we compare results obtained by a supervised WSD system for English using manually sense annotated training examples against results obtained by the same WSD system trained on SALAAM sense tagged examples. The test data is the same, namely, the SENSEVAL 2 English Lexical Sample test set. The supervised WSD system chosen here is the University of Maryland System for SENSEVAL 2 Tagging (  ) (Cabezas et al. , 2002). 3.1  The learning approach adopted by  is based on Support Vector Machines (SVM).

The weight calculation is a variant on the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) measure in Information Retrieval. The weighting, in this case, is an Inverse Category Frequency (ICF) measure where each token is weighted by the inverse of its frequency of occurrence in the specifiedcontext of the target word. 3.1.1 Manually Annotated Training Data The manually-annotated training data is the SENSEVAL2 Lexical Sample training data for the English task, (SV2LS Train).2","This training data corpus comprises 44856 lines and 917740 tokens.","There is a close affinitybetween the test data and the manually annotated training data. The Pearson  ","correlation between the sense distributions for","the test data and the manually annotated training","data, per test item, ranges between",".3 3.2 SALAAM SALAAM exploits parallel corpora for sense annotation. The key intuition behind SALAAM is that when words in one language, L1, are translated into the same word in a second language, L2, then those L1 words are semantically similar. For example, when the English — L1 — words bank, brokerage, mortgage-lender translate into the French — L2 — word banque in a parallel corpus, where bank is polysemous, SALAAM discovers that the intended sense for bank is the financial institution sense, not the geological formation sense, based on the fact that it is grouped with brokerage and mortgage-lender. SALAAM’s algorithm is as follows:","","SALAAM expects a word aligned parallel cor-","pus as input;","2","http://www.senseval.org","3","The correlation is measured between two frequency distributions. Throughout this paper, we opt for using the parametric Pearson","correlation rather than KL distance in order to test statistical significance."," L1 words that translate into the same L2 word are grouped into clusters;"," SALAAM identifies the appropriate senses for the words in those clusters based on the words senses’ proximity in WordNet. The word sense proximity is measured in information theoretic terms based on an algorithm by Resnik (Resnik, 1999);"," A sense selection criterion is applied to choose the appropriate sense label or set of sense labels for each word in the cluster;"," The chosen sense tags for the words in the cluster are propagated back to their respective contexts in the parallel text. Simultaneously, SALAAM projects the propagated sense tags for L1 words onto their L2 corresponding translations. 3.2.1 Automatically Generated SALAAM","Training Data Three sets of SALAAM tagged training corpora are created:"," SV2LS TR: English SENSEVAL2 Lexical Sample trial and training corpora with no manual annotations. It comprises 61879 lines and 1084064 tokens."," MT: The English Brown Corpus, SENSE-VAL1 (trial, training and test corpora), Wall Street Journal corpus, and SENSEVAL 2 All Words corpus. All of which comprise 151762 lines and 37945517 tokens."," HT: UN English corpus which comprises 71672 lines of 1734001 tokens","The SALAAM-tagged corpora are rendered in a format similar to that of the manually annotated training data. The automatic sense tagging for MT and SV2LS TR training data is based on using SALAAM with machine translated parallel corpora. The HT training corpus is automatically sense tagged based on using SALAAM with the English-Spanish UN naturally occurring parallel corpus. 3.3 Experimental Conditions Experimental conditions are created based on three of SALAAM’s tagging factors, Corpus, Language and Threshold:"," Corpus: There are 4 different combinations for the training corpora: MT+SV2LS TR; MT+HT+SV2LS TR; HT+SV2LS TR; or SV2LS TR alone."," Language: The context language of the parallel corpus used by SALAAM to obtain the sense tags for the English training corpus. There are three options: French (FR), Spanish (SP), or, Merged languages (ML), where the results are obtained by merging the English output of FR and SP."," Threshold: Sense selection criterion, in SALAAM, is set to either MAX (M) or THRESH (T). These factors result in 39 conditions.4 3.4 Test Data The test data are the 29 noun test items for the SENSEVAL 2 English Lexical Sample task, (SV2LS-Test). The data is tagged with the WordNet 1.7pre (Fellbaum, 1998; Cotton et al. , 2001).

This","contrasts with nation, which has more than 4200","training examples, but yields a low PR score of","","",".","Accordingly, the number of training examples alone","does not seem to have a direct impact on PR. 5.3 Sense Perplexity This factor is a characteristic of the training data. Perplexity is","   . Entropy is measured as follows:      ","","    ","","         (2)","where is a sense for a polysemous noun and","is","the set of all its senses.","Entropy is a measure of confusability in the","senses’ contexts distributions; when the distribution","is relatively uniform, entropy is high.

While nouns with rel-","atively low perplexity values such as grip (sense","perplexity of","","",") yields a low PR score of","",".","Moreover, nouns with the same perplexity and sim-","ilar number of senses yield very different PR scores.","For example, examining holiday and child, both","have the same perplexity of","","","","and the number","of senses is close, with 6 and 7 senses, respectively,","however, the PR scores are very different; holiday","yields a PR of","","",", and child achieves a PR of","",".","Furthermore, nature and art have the same perplex-","ity of","","  ; art has 17 senses while nature has 7","senses only, nonetheless, art yields a much higher","PR score of (","",") compared to a PR of","","for","nature.","These observations are further solidified by the","insignificantcorrelation of","","","","","",",","","","","","","","","","","","   ","between sense perplexity and PR. At firstblush, one is inclined to hypothesize that, the combination of low perplexity associated with a large number of senses — as an indication of high skew in the distribution — is a good indicator of high PR, but reviewing the data, this hypothesis is dispelled by day which has 16 senses and a sense perplexity of","",", yet yields a low PR score of","","",". 5.4 Semantic Translation Entropy Semantic translation entropy (STE) (Melamed, 1997) is a special characteristic of the SALAAM-tagged training data, since the source of evidence for SALAAM tagging is multilingual translations. STE measures the amount of translational variation for an L1 word in L2, in a parallel corpus. STE is a variant on the entropy measure. STE is expressed as follows:        ","        ","","   ","","","     (3) where","is a translation in the set of possible translations ","in L2; and","is L1 word.","The probability of a translation","is calculated di-","rectly from the alignments of the test nouns and","their corresponding translations via the maximum","likelihood estimate.","Variation in translation is beneficial for SALAAM","tagging, therefore, high STE is a desirable feature.","Correlation between the automatic tagging preci-","sion and STE is expected to be high if SALAAM","has good quality translations and good quality align-","ments. However, this correlation is a low","","","",". Consequently, we observe a low correlation","between STE and PR,","","","",",","","","","","","","","",""," ",""," ",". Examining the data, the nouns bum, detention,","dyke, stress, and yew exhibit both high STE and high","PR; Moreover, there are several nouns that exhibit","low STE and low PR. But the intriguing items are","those that are inconsistent. For instance, child and","holiday: child has an STE of","","","and comprises 7","senses at a low sense perplexity of","","","",", yet yields","a high PR of","",". As mentioned earlier, low STE","indicates lack of translational variation. In this spe-","cific experimental condition, child is translated as","enfant, enfantile, ni ño, niño-pequeño",", which are","words that preserve ambiguity in both French and","Spanish. On the other hand, holiday has a relatively","high STE value of","",", yet results in the lowest PR","of  ",". Consequently, we conclude that STE alone","is not a good direct indicator of PR. 5.5 Perplexity Difference Perplexity difference (PerpDiff) is a measure of the absolute difference in sense perplexity between the","test data items and the training data items. For the","manually annotated training data items, the overall","correlation between the perplexity measures is a sig-","nificant ","","","which contrasts to a low over-","all correlation of","","","","","between the SALAAM-","tagged training data items and the test data items.","Across the nouns in this study, the correlation be-","tween PerpDiff and PR is","","","","",". It is advan-","tageous to be as similar as possible to the training","data to guarantee good classification results within","a supervised framework, therefore a low PerpDiff","is desirable. We observe cases with a low PerpDiff","such as holiday (PerpDiff of","","","), yet the PR is a","low","","",". On the other hand, items such as art have","a relatively high PerpDiff of","","",", but achieves a","high PR of ",". Accordingly, PerpDiff alone is not","a good indicator of PR.","5.6 Sense Distributional Correlation","Sense Distributional Correlation (SDC) results from","comparing the sense distributions of the test data","items with those of SALAAM-tagged training data","items. It is worth noting that the correlation be-","tween the SDC of manually annotated training data","and that of the test data ranges from","","","    . A strong significant correlation of","","","",",   ","","","",""," ","","","","","","",""," ","between SDC and","PR exists for SALAAM-tagged training data and the","test data. Overall, nouns that yield high PR have","high SDC values. However, there are some in-","stances where this strong correlation is not exhib-","ited. For example, circuit and post have relatively","high SDC values, ","","","and","","",", respectively,","in","  ",", but they score lower PR values than detention which has a comparatively lower SDC value of","","",". The fact that both circuit and post have many senses, 13 and 12, respectively, while detention has 4 senses only is noteworthy. detention has a higher STE and lower sense perplexity than either of them however. Overall, the data suggests that SDC is a very good direct indicator of PR. 5.7 Sense Context Confusability A situation of sense context confusability (SCC) arises when two senses of a noun are very similar and are highly uniformly represented in the training examples. This is an artifact of the fine granularity of senses in WordNet 1.7pre. Highly similar senses typically lead to similar usages, therefore similar contexts, which in a learning framework detract from the learning algorithm’s discriminatory power.","Upon examining the 29 polysemous nouns in the training and test sets, we observe that a significant number of the words have similar senses according to a manual grouping provided by Palmer, in 2002.9 For example, senses 2 and 3 of nature, meaning trait and quality, respectively, are considered similar by the manual grouping. The manual grouping does not provide total coverage of all the noun senses in this test set. For instance, it only considers the homonymic senses 1, 2 and 3 of spade, yet, in the current test set, spade has 6 senses, due to the existence of sub senses.","26 of the 29 test items exhibit multiple groupings based on the manual grouping. Only three nouns, detention, dyke, spade do not have any sense groupings. They all, in turn, achieve high PR scores of  ","",".","There are several nouns that have relatively high SDC values yet their performance ratios are low such as post, nation, channel and circuit. For instance, nation has a very high SDC value of","",", a low sense perplexity of","","— relatively close to the","","","sense perplexity of the test data — a sufficient number of contexts (4350), yet it yields a PR of","","",". According to the manual sense grouping, senses 1 and 3 are similar, and indeed, upon inspec-tion of the context distributions, we find the bulk of the senses’ instance examples in the SALAAM-tagged training data for the condition that yields this PR in","  ","are annotated with either sense 1 or sense 3, thereby creating confusable contexts for the learning algorithm. All the cases of nouns that achieve high PR and possess sense groups do not have any SCC in the training data which strongly suggests that SCC is an important factor to consider when predicting the PR of a system. 5.8 Discussion We conclude from the above exploration that SDC and SCC affect PR scores directly. PerpDiff, STE, and Sense Perplexity, number of senses and number of contexts seem to have no noticeable direct impact on the PR.","Based on this observation, we calculate the SDC values for all the training data used in our experimental conditions for the 29 test items.","Table 3 illustrates the items with the highest SDC values, in descending order, as yielded from any of the SALAAM conditions. We use an empirical cut-off value of","","for SDC. The SCC values are reported as a boolean Y/N value, where a Y indicates the presence of a sense confusable context.

Therefore, a combination of high SDC and nonexistent SCC can reliably predict good PR. But the other factors still have a role to play in order to achieve accurate prediction. It is worth emphasizing that two of the identified factors are dependent on the test data in this study, SDC and PerpDiff. One solution to this problem is to estimate SDC and PerpDiff using a held out data set that is hand tagged. Such a held out data set would be considerably smaller than the required size of a manually tagged training data for a classical supervised WSD system. Hence, SALAAM-tagged training data offers a viable solution to the annotation acquisition bottleneck."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and Future Directions","paragraphs":["In this paper, we applied an unsupervised approach within a learning framework"," ","for the sense annotation of large amounts of data.
