In the “information projection” approach (e.g., (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001)), statistical word alignment is applied to a parallel corpus of English and some other language ","for which no tagger/morphological analyzer/chunker etc. (henceforth simply: analysis tool) exists. A high-quality analysis tool is applied to the English text, and the statistical word alignment is used to project a (noisy) target annotation to the ","version of the text. Robust learning techniques are then applied to bootstrap an analysis tool for ",", using the annotations projected with high confidence as the initial training data. (Confidence of both the English analysis tool and the statistical word alignment is taken into account.) The results that have been achieved by this method are very encouraging.","Will the information projection approach also work for less shallow analysis tools, in particular full syntactic parsers? An obvious issue is that one does not expect the phrase structure representation of English (as produced by state-of-the-art treebank parsers) to carry over to less configurational languages. Therefore, (Hwa et al., 2002) extract a more language-independent dependency structure from the English parse as the basis for projection to Chinese. From the resulting (noisy) dependency treebank, a dependency parser is trained using the techniques of (Collins, 1999). (Hwa et al., 2002) report that the noise in the projected treebank is still a major challenge, suggesting that a future research focus should be on the filtering of (parts of) unreliable trees and statistical word alignment models sensitive to the syntactic projection framework.","Our hypothesis is that the quality of the resulting parser/grammar for language ","can be significantly improved if the training method for the parser is changed to accomodate for training data which are in part unreliable. The experiments we report in this paper focus on a specific part of the problem: we replace standard treebank training with an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for PCFGs, augmented by weighting factors for the reliability of training data, following the approach of (Nigam et al., 2000), who apply it for EM training of a text classifier. The factors are only sensitive to the constituent/distituent (C/D) status of each span of the string in ","(cp. (Klein and Manning, 2002)). The C/D status is derived from an aligned parallel corpus in a way discussed in section 2. We use the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2002), and the statistical word alignment was performed with the GIZA++ toolkit (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999; Och and Ney, 2003).1","For the current experiments we assume no pre-existing parser for any of the languages, contrary to the information projection scenario. While better absolute results could be expected using one or more parsers for the languages involved, we think that it is important to isolate the usefulness of exploiting just crosslinguistic word order divergences in order to obtain partial prior knowledge about the constituent structure of a language, which is then exploited in an EM learning approach (section 3). Not using a parser for some languages also makes it possible to compare various language pairs at the same level, and specifically, we can experiment with grammar induction for English exploiting various","1","The software is available at","http://www.isi.edu/õch/GIZA++.html","At","that","moment","the","voting","will","commence",".","Le","vote","aura","lieu à","ce","moment","-la",".

Projecting phrasal constituents from one language to another is problematic in cases of divergence, but projecting information about distituents is generally safe. Mild divergences are best. As should be clear, the","-block-based approach relies on the occurrence of reorderings of constituents in translation. If two languages have the exact same structure (and no paraphrases whatsoever are used in translation), the approach does not gain any information from a parallel text. However, this situation does not occur realistically. If on the other hand, massive reorder-ing occurs without preserving any contiguous sub-blocks, the approach cannot gain information either. The ideal situation is in the middleground, with a number of mid-sized blocks in most sentences. The table in figure2 shows the distribution of sentences with","","-block boundaries based on the alignment of English and 7 other languages, for a sample of c. 3,000 sentences from the Europarl corpus.

Besides a statistical word alignment, no further resources are required.","In order to make use of this scattered (non-) constituency information, a semi-supervised approach is needed that can fill in the (potentially large) areas for which no prior information is available. For the present experiments we decided to choose a conceptually simple such approach, with which we can build on substantial existing work in grammar induction: we construe the learning problem as PCFG induction, using the inside-outside algorithm, with the addition of weighting factors based on the (non- )constituency information. This use of weighting factors in EM learning follows the approach discussed in (Nigam et al., 2000).","Since we are mainly interested in comparative experiments at this stage, the conceptual simplicity, and the availability of efficient implemented open-","7","Since zero-fertility words are often function words, there is probably a rightward-tendency that one might be able to exploit; however in the present study we didn’t want to build such high-level linguistic assumptions into the system. source systems of a PCFG induction approach outweighs the disadvantage of potentially poorer over-all performance than one might expect from some other approaches.","The PCFG topology we use is a binary, entirely unrestricted X-bar-style grammar based on the Penn Treebank POS-tagset (expanded as in the TreeTagger by (Schmid, 1994)).

In the iterative induction process of parameter reestimation, the current rule parameters are used to compute the expectations of how often each rule occurred in the parses of the training corpus, and these expectations are used to adjust the rule parameters, so that the likelihood of the training data is increased. When the probablity of a given rule drops below a certain threshold, the rule is excluded from the grammar. The iteration is continued until the increase in likelihood of the training corpus is very small. Weight factors.

We also experimented with various levels of weight factors: for instance, distituents were assigned factor 0.01, likely distituents factor 0.1, neutral spans 1, and likely constituents factor 2. Likely constituents are defined as spans for which one end is adjacent to an empty block boundary zone (i.e., there is no zero fertility word in the block boundary zone which could be the actual boundary of constituents in which the block is involved).","Most variations in the weighting scheme did not have a significanteffect, but they caused differences in coverage because rules with a probability below a certain threshold were dropped in training.

The evaluation criteria we apply are unlabeled bracketing precision and recall (and crossing brackets). We follow an evaluation criterion that (Klein and Manning, 2002, footnote 3) discuss for the evaluation of a not fully supervised grammar induction approach based on a binary grammar topology: bracket multiplicity (i.e., non-branching projections) is collapsed into a single set of brackets (since what is relevant is the constituent structure that was induced).11 For comparison, we provide baseline results that a uniform left-branching structure and a uniform right-branching structure (which encodes some nontrivial information about English syntax) would give rise to.

Note that nothing in our methodology made any language particular assumptions; future research has to show whether there are language pairs that are particularly effective, but in general the technique should be applicable for whatever parallel corpus is at hand.","A number of studies are related to the work we presented, most specifically work on parallel-text based “information projection” for parsing (Hwa et al., 2002), but also grammar induction work based on constituent/distituent information (Klein and Manning, 2002) and (language-internal) alignment-based learning (van Zaanen, 2000). However to our knowledge the specific way of bringing these as-pects together is new."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Yaser Al-Onaizan, Jan Curin, Michael Jahr, Kevin Knight, John Lafferty, Dan Melamed, Franz-Josef Och, David Purdy, Noah A.
