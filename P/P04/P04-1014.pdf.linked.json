In Clark and Curran (2003) we argued for the use of log-linear parsing models for CCG. However, estimating a log-linear model for a wide-coverage CCG grammar is very computationally expensive. Following Miyao and Tsujii (2002), we showed how the estimation can be performed efficiently by applying the inside-outside algorithm to a packed chart. We also showed how the complete WSJ Penn Treebank can be used for training by developing a parallel version of Generalised Iterative Scaling (GIS) to perform the estimation.","This paper significantly extends our earlier work in a number of ways. First, we evaluate a number of log-linear models, obtaining results which are competitive with the state-of-the-art for CCG parsing. We also compare log-linear models which use all CCG derivations, including non-standard derivations, with normal-form models. Second, we find that GIS is unsuitable for estimating a model of the size being considered, and develop a parallel version of the L-BFGS algorithm (Nocedal and Wright, 1999). And finally, we show that the parsing algorithm described in Clark and Curran (2003) is extremely slow in some cases, and suggest an efficient alternative based on Goodman (1996).","The development of parsing and estimation algorithms for models which use all derivations extends existing CCG parsing techniques, and allows us to test whether there is useful information in the additional derivations. However, we findthat the performance of the normal-form model is at least as good as the all-derivations model, in our experiments to-date. The normal-form approach allows the use of additional constraints on rule applications, leading to a smaller model, reducing the computational resources required for estimation, and resulting in an extremely efficientparser.","This paper assumes a basic understanding of CCG; see Steedman (2000) for an introduction, and Clark et al. (2002) and Hockenmaier (2003a) for an introduction to statistical parsing with CCG."]},{"title":"2 Parsing Models for CCG","paragraphs":["CCG is unusual among grammar formalisms in that, for each derived structure for a sentence, there can be many derivations leading to that structure. The presence of such ambiguity, sometimes referred to as spurious ambiguity, enables CCG to produce elegant analyses of coordination and extraction phenomena (Steedman, 2000). However, the introduction of extra derivations increases the complexity of the modelling and parsing problem.","Clark et al. (2002) handle the additional derivations by modelling the derived structure, in their case dependency structures. They use a conditional model, based on Collins (1996), which, as the authors acknowledge, has a number of theoretical deficiencies; thus the results of Clark et al. provide a useful baseline for the new models presented here.","Hockenmaier (2003a) uses a model which favours only one of the derivations leading to a derived structure, namely the normal-form derivation (Eisner, 1996). In this paper we compare the normal-form approach with a dependency model. For the dependency model, we define the probability of a dependency structure as follows: P(jS ) = X d2() P(d; jS ) (1) where is a dependency structure, S is a sentence and () is the set of derivations which lead to . This extends the approach of Clark et al. (2002) who modelled the dependency structures directly, not using any information from the derivations. In contrast to the dependency model, the normal-form model simply defines a distribution over normal-form derivations.","The dependency structures considered in this paper are described in detail in Clark et al. (2002) and Clark and Curran (2003). Each argument slot in a CCG lexical category represents a dependency relation, and a dependency is defined as a 5-tuple hh f ; f; s; ha; li, where h f is the head word of the lexical category, f is the lexical category, s is the argument slot, ha is the head word of the argument, and l indicates whether the dependency is long-range. For example, the long-range dependency encoding company as the extracted object of bought (as in the company that IBM bought) is represented as the following 5-tuple: hbought; (S[dcl]nNP1)=NP2; 2; company; i where is the category (NPnNP)=(S[dcl]=NP) assigned to the relative pronoun. For local dependencies l is assigned a null value. A dependency structure is a multiset of these dependencies."]},{"title":"3 Log-Linear Parsing Models","paragraphs":["Log-linear models (also known as Maximum Entropy models) are popular in NLP because of the ease with which discriminating features can be in-cluded in the model. Log-linear models have been applied to the parsing problem across a range of grammar formalisms, e.g. Riezler et al. (2002) and Toutanova et al. (2002). One motivation for using a log-linear model is that long-range dependencies which CCG was designed to handle can easily be encoded as features.","A conditional log-linear model of a parse ! 2 , given a sentence S , is definedas follows: P(!jS ) = 1 ZS","e:f (!) (2) where :f (!) = P","i i fi(!). The function fi is a feature of the parse which can be any real-valued function over the space of parses . Each feature fi has an associated weight i which is a parameter of the model to be estimated. ZS is a normalising constant which ensures that P(!jS ) is a probability distribution: ZS = X","!0 2(S )","e:f (!0 ) (3) where (S ) is the set of possible parses for S .","For the dependency model a parse, !, is a hd; i pair (as given in (1)). A feature is a count of the number of times some configuration occurs in d or the number of times some dependency occurs in . Section 6 gives examples of features. 3.1 The Dependency Model We follow Riezler et al. (2002) in using a discriminative estimation method by maximising the conditional likelihood of the model given the data. For the dependency model, the data consists of sentences S 1; : : : ; S m, together with gold standard dependency structures, 1; : : : ; m. The gold standard structures are multisets of dependencies, as described earlier. Section 6 explains how the gold standard structures are obtained.","The objective function of a model is the conditional log-likelihood, L(), minus a Gaussian prior term, G(), used to reduce overfitting (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999). Hence, given the definitionof the probability of a dependency structure (1), the objective function is as follows:","L0 () = L() G() (4) = log mY j=1 P(jjS j) nX i=1 2 i 22 i = mX j=1 log P d2(j) e:f (d;j) P !2(S j) e:f (!) nX i=1 2 i 22 i = mX j=1 log X d2(j) e:f (d;j) mX j=1 log X !2(S j)","e:f (!) nX i=1 2 i 22 i where n is the number of features. Rather than have a different smoothing parameter i for each feature, we use a single parameter .","We use a technique from the numerical optimisation literature, the L-BFGS algorithm (Nocedal and Wright, 1999), to optimise the objective function. L-BFGS is an iterative algorithm which requires the gradient of the objective function to be computed at each iteration. The components of the gradient vector are as follows:","@L0 () @i = mX j=1 X d2(j)","e:f (d;j) f i(d; j) P d2(j) e:f (d;j) (5) mX j=1 X !2(S j)","e:f (!) f i(!) P !2(S j) e:f (!)  i 2 i","The firsttwo terms in (5) are expectations of feature fi: the first expectation is over all derivations leading to each gold standard dependency structure; the second is over all derivations for each sentence in the training data. Setting the gradient to zero yields the usual maximum entropy constraints (Berger et al., 1996), except that in this case the empirical values are themselves expectations (over all derivations leading to each gold standard dependency structure). The estimation process attempts to make the expectations equal, by putting as much mass as possible on the derivations leading to the gold standard structures.1","The Gaussian prior term penalises any model whose weights get too large in absolute value.","Calculation of the feature expectations requires summing over all derivations for a sentence, and summing over all derivations leading to a gold standard dependency structure. In both cases there can be exponentially many derivations, and so enumerating all derivations is not possible (at least for wide-coverage automatically extracted grammars). Clark and Curran (2003) show how the sum over the complete derivation space can be performed efficiently using a packed chart and a variant of the inside-outside algorithm. Section 5 shows how the same technique can also be applied to all derivations leading to a gold standard dependency structure. 3.2 The Normal-Form Model The objective function and gradient vector for the normal-form model are as follows:","L0 () = L() G() (6) = log mY j=1 P(d jjS j) nX i=1 2 i 22 i","@L0 () @i = mX j=1 fi(d j) (7) mX j=1 X d2(S j)","e:f (d) f i(d) P d2(S j) e:f (d)  i 2 i 1 See Riezler et al. (2002) for a similar description in the","context of LFG parsing. where d j is the the gold standard derivation for sentence S j and (S j) is the set of possible derivations for S j. Note that the empirical expectation in (7) is simply a count of the number of times the feature appears in the gold-standard derivations."]},{"title":"4 Packed Charts","paragraphs":["The packed charts perform a number of roles: they are a compact representation of a very large number of CCG derivations; they allow recovery of the highest scoring parse or dependency structure without enumerating all derivations; and they represent an instance of what Miyao and Tsujii (2002) call a feature forest, which is used to efficientlyestimate a log-linear model. The idea behind a packed chart is simple: equivalent chart entries of the same type, in the same cell, are grouped together, and back pointers to the daughters indicate how an individual entry was created. Equivalent entries form the same structures in any subsequent parsing.","Since the packed charts are used for model estimation and recovery of the highest scoring parse or dependency structure, the features in the model partly determine which entries can be grouped together. In this paper we use features from the dependency structure, and features defined on the local rule instantiations.2","Hence, any two entries with identical category type, identical head, and identical unfilleddependencies are equivalent. Note that not all features are local to a rule instantiation; for example, features encoding long-range dependencies may involve words which are a long way apart in the sentence.","For the purposes of estimation and finding the highest scoring parse or dependency structure, only entries which are part of a derivation spanning the whole sentence are relevant. These entries can be easily found by traversing the chart top-down, start-ing with the entries which span the sentence. The entries within spanning derivations form a feature forest (Miyao and Tsujii, 2002). A feature forest is a tuple hC; D; R; ; i where:"," C is a set of conjunctive nodes;"," D is a set of disjunctive nodes;"," R D is a set of root disjunctive nodes;"," : D ! 2C","is a conjunctive daughter function;"," : C ! 2D","is a disjunctive daughter function.","The individual entries in a cell are conjunctive nodes, and the equivalence classes of entries are dis-2 By rule instantiation we mean the local tree arising from","the application of a CCG combinatory rule. hC; D; R; ; i is a packed chart / feature forest G is a set of gold standard dependencies Let c be a conjunctive node Let d be a disjunctive node deps(c) is the set of dependencies on node c cdeps(c) = ( 1 if, for some 2 deps(c); G jdeps(c)j otherwise dmax(c) = 8 >>>< >>>: 1 if cdeps(c) = 1 1 if dmax(d) = 1 for some d 2 (c)P","d2(c) dmax(d) + cdeps(c) otherwise dmax(d) = maxfdmax(c) j c 2 (d)g","mark(d):","mark d as a correct node","foreach c 2 (d) if dmax(c) = dmax(d) mark c as a correct node foreach d0","2 (c) mark(d0",") foreach dr 2 R such that dmax.

For the normal-form model, the empirical expected values and the likelihood can easily be obtained, since these only involve the single gold-standard derivation for each sentence. The expected values can be calculated using the method in Clark and Curran (2003).","For the dependency model, the computations of the empirical expected values (5) and the likelihood function (4) are more complex, since these require sums over just those derivations leading to the gold standard dependency structure. We will refer to such derivations as correct derivations.","Figure 1 gives an algorithm for finding nodes in a packed chart which appear in correct derivations. cdeps(c) is the number of correct dependencies on conjunctive node c, and takes the value 1 if there are any incorrect dependencies on c. dmax(c) is 3 A more complete description of CCG feature forests is","given in Clark and Curran (2003). the maximum number of correct dependencies produced by any sub-derivation headed by c, and takes the value 1 if there are no sub-derivations producing only correct dependencies. dmax(d) is the same value but for disjunctive node d. Recursive defini-tions for calculating these values are given in Figure 1; the base case occurs when conjunctive nodes have no disjunctive daughters.","The algorithm identifies all those root nodes heading derivations which produce just the correct dependencies, and traverses the chart top-down marking the nodes in those derivations. The in-sight behind the algorithm is that, for two conjunctive nodes in the same equivalence class, if one node heads a sub-derivation producing more correct dependencies than the other node (and each sub-derivation only produces correct dependencies), then the node with less correct dependencies cannot be part of a correct derivation.","The conjunctive and disjunctive nodes appearing in correct derivations form a new correct feature forest.

Not all rule instantiations in CCGbank are instances of combinatory rules, and not all can be produced by the parser, and so gold standard structures were created for 85.5% of the sentences in sections 2-21 (33,777 sentences).","The same parser is used to produce the packed charts. The parser uses a maximum entropy supertagger (Clark and Curran, 2004) to assign lexical categories to the words in a sentence, and applies the CKY chart parsing algorithm described in Steedman (2000). For parsing the training data, we ensure that the correct category is a member of the set assigned to each word. The average number of categories assigned to each word is determined by a parameter in the supertagger. For the first set of experiments, we used a setting which assigns 1.7 categories on average per word.","The feature set for the dependency model consists of the following types of features: dependency features (with and without distance measures), rule instantiation features (with and without a lexical head), lexical category features, and root category features. Dependency features are the 5-tuples defined in Section 1. There are also three additional dependency feature types which have an extra distance field (and only include the head of the lexical category, and not the head of the argument); these count the number of words (0, 1, 2 or more), punctuation marks (0, 1, 2 or more), and verbs (0, 1 or more) between head and dependent. Lexi-cal category features are word–category pairs at the leaf nodes, and root features are headword–category pairs at the root nodes. Rule instantiation features simply encode the combining categories together with the result category. There is an additional rule feature type which also encodes the lexical head of the resulting category. Additional generalised features for each feature type are formed by replacing words with their POS tags.","The feature set for the normal-form model is the same except that, following Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002), the dependency features are defined in terms of the local rule instantiations, by adding the heads of the combining categories to the rule instantiation features. Again there are 3 additional distance feature types, as above, which only include the head of the resulting category. We had hoped that by modelling the predicate-argument dependencies produced by the parser, rather than local rule dependencies, we would improve performance. However, using the predicate-argument dependencies in the normal-form model instead of, or in addition to, the local rule dependencies, has not led to an improvement in parsing accuracy.","Only features which occurred more than once in the training data were included, except that, for the dependency model, the cutoff for the rule features was 9 and the counting was performed across all derivations, not just the gold-standard derivation. The normal-form model has 482,007 features and the dependency model has 984,522 features.","We used 45 machines of a 64-node Beowulf cluster to estimate the dependency model, with an average memory usage of approximately 550 MB for each machine. For the normal-form model we were able to reduce the size of the charts considerably by applying two types of restriction to the parser: first, categories can only combine if they appear together in a rule instantiation in sections 2–21 of CCGbank; and second, we apply the normal-form restrictions described in Eisner (1996). (See Clark and Curran (2004) for a description of the Eisner constraints.) The normal-form model requires only 5 machines for estimation, with an average memory usage of 730 MB for each machine.","Initially we tried the parallel version of GIS described in Clark and Curran (2003) to perform the estimation, running over the Beowulf cluster. However, we found that GIS converged extremely slowly; this is in line with other recent results in the literature applying GIS to globally optimised models such as conditional random fields, e.g. Sha and Pereira (2003). As an alternative to GIS, we have implemented a parallel version of our L-BFGS code using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard. L-BFGS over forests can be parallelised, using the method described in Clark and Curran (2003) to cal-culate the feature expectations. The L-BFGS algorithm, run to convergence on the cluster, takes 479 iterations and 2 hours for the normal-form model, and 1,550 iterations and roughly 17 hours for the dependency model."]},{"title":"7 Parsing Algorithm","paragraphs":["For the normal-form model, the Viterbi algorithm is used to find the most probable derivation. For the dependency model, the highest scoring dependency structure is required. Clark and Curran (2003) outlines an algorithm for findingthe most probable dependency structure, which keeps track of the highest scoring set of dependencies for each node in the chart. For a set of equivalent entries in the chart (a disjunctive node), this involves summing over all conjunctive node daughters which head sub-derivations leading to the same set of high scoring dependencies. In practice large numbers of such conjunctive nodes lead to very long parse times.","As an alternative to finding the most probable dependency structure, we have developed an algorithm which maximises the expected labelled recall over dependencies. Our algorithm is based on Goodman’s (1996) labelled recall algorithm for the phrase-structure PARSEVAL measures.","Let Lbe the number of correct dependencies in with respect to a gold standard dependency structure G; then the dependency structure, max, which maximises the expected recall rate is:","max = arg max  E(L=jGj) (10)","= arg max  X i P(ijS )j\\ ij where S is the sentence for gold standard dependency structure G and i ranges over the dependency structures for S .

We use the novel strategy developed in Clark and Curran (2004): firstassign a small number of categories (approximately 1.4) on average to each word, and increase the number of categories if the parser fails to findan analysis. We were able to parse 98.9% of section 23 using this strategy. Clark and Curran (2004) shows that this supertagging method results in a highly efficientparser.","For the normal-form model we returned the dependency structure for the most probable derivation, applying the two types of normal-form constraints described in Section 6. For the dependency model we returned the dependency structure with the highest expected labelled recall score.","Following Clark et al.

The results of Clark et al. (2002) and Hockenmaier (2003a) are shown for comparison. The dependency set used by Hockenmaier contains some minor differences to the set used here, but “e valuating” our test set against Hockenmaier’s gives an F-score of over 97%, showing the test sets to be very similar. The results show that our parser is performing significantly better than that of Clark et al., demonstrating the benefit of derivation features and the use of a sound statistical model.","The results given so far have all used gold standard POS tags from CCGbank. Table 3 also gives the results if automatically assigned POS tags are used in the training and testing phases, using the C&C POS tagger (Curran and Clark, 2003). The performance reduction is expected given that the supertagger relies heavily on POS tags as features.","More investigation is needed to properly compare our parser and Hockenmaier’s, since there are a number of differences in addition to the models used: Hockenmaier effectively reads a lexicalised PCFG off CCGbank, and is able to use all of the available training data; Hockenmaier does not use a supertagger, but does use a beam search.","Parsing the 2,401 sentences in section 23 takes 1.6 minutes using the normal-form model, and 10.5 minutes using the dependency model. The difference is due largely to the normal-form constraints used by the normal-form parser. Clark and Curran (2004) shows that the normal-form constraints significantly increase parsing speed and, in combina-tion with adaptive supertagging, result in a highly efficientwide-coverage parser.","As a final oracle experiment we parsed the sentences in section 00 using the correct lexical categories from CCGbank. Since the parser uses only a subset of the lexical categories in CCGbank, 7% of the sentences could not be parsed; however, the labelled F-score for the parsed sentences was almost 98%. This very high score demonstrates the large amount of information in lexical categories."]},{"title":"9 Conclusion","paragraphs":["A major contribution of this paper has been the development of a parsing model for CCG which uses all derivations, including non-standard derivations. Non-standard derivations are an integral part of the CCG formalism, and it is an interesting question whether efficientestimation and parsing algorithms can be definedfor models which use all derivations. We have answered this question, and in doing so developed a new parsing algorithm for CCG which maximises expected recall of dependencies.","We would like to extend the dependency model, by including the local-rule dependencies which are used by the normal-form model, for example. However, one of the disadvantages of the dependency model is that the estimation process is already using a large proportion of our existing resources, and extending the feature set will further increase the execution time and memory requirement of the estimation algorithm.","We have also shown that a normal-form model performs as well as the dependency model. There are a number of advantages to the normal-form model: it requires less space and time resources for estimation and it produces a faster parser. Our normal-form parser significantly outperforms the parser of Clark et al. (2002) and produces results at least as good as the current state-of-the-art for CCG parsing. The use of adaptive supertagging and the normal-form constraints result in a very efficient wide-coverage parser. Our system demonstrates that accurate and efficientwide-coverage CCG parsing is feasible.","Future work will investigate extending the feature sets used by the log-linear models with the aim of further increasing parsing accuracy. Finally, the oracle results suggest that further experimentation with the supertagger will significantly improve parsing accuracy, efficiency and robustness."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Julia Hockenmaier for the use of CCGbank and helpful comments, and Mark Steedman for guidance and advice.
