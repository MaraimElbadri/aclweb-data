The work described in this paper considers the importance of temporal context. We show that knowing one small piece of information–a document’s publication date–can be beneficialfor a variety of CL tasks, some familiar and some novel.","The fieldof historical linguistics attempts to categorize changes at all levels of language use, typically relying on data that span centuries (Hock, 1991). The recent availability of very large textual corpora allows for the examination of changes that take place across shorter time periods. In particular, we focus on lexical change across decades in corpora of academic publications and show that the changes can be fairly dramatic during a relatively short period of time.","As a preview, consider Table 1, which lists the top five unigrams that best distinguished the field of computational linguistics at different points in time, as derived from the ACL proceedings1","using the odds ratio measure (see Section 3). One can quickly glean that the field has become increasingly empirical through time. 1979-84 1985-90 1991-96 1997-02 system phrase discourse word natural plan tree corpus language structure algorithm training knowledge logical unification model database interpret plan data Table 1: ACL’s most characteristic terms for four time periods, as measured by the odds ratio","With respect to academic publications, the very nature of the enterprise forces the language used within a discipline to change. An author’s word choice is shaped by the preceding literature, as she must say something novel while placing her contribution in the context of what has already been said. This begets neologisms, new word senses, and other types of changes.","This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we introduce temporal term weighting, a technique that implicitly encodes time into keyword weights to enhance information retrieval. Section 3 describes the technique of temporal feature modification, which exploits temporal information to improve the text categorization task. Section 4 in-troduces several types of lexical changes and a potential application in document clustering.","1","The details of each corpus used in this paper can be found in the appendix. 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 19970 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 Year Frequency per 1000 expert system neural networks Figure 1: Changing frequencies in AI abstracts"]},{"title":"2 Time in information retrieval","paragraphs":["In the task of retrieving relevant documents based upon keyword queries, it is customary to treat each document as a vector of terms with associated “weights”. One notion of term weight simply counts the occurrences of each term. Of more utility is the scheme known as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF.IDF):","","where","is the weight of term k in document d,","is the frequency of k in d, N is the total number of documents in the corpus, and","is the total number of documents containing k. Very frequent terms (such as function words) that occur in many documents are downweighted, while those that are fairly unique have their weights boosted.","Many variations of TF.IDF have been suggested (Singhal, 1997). Our variation, temporal term weighting (TTW), incorporates a term’s IDF at different points in time:","","Under this scheme, the document collection is divided into T time slices, and N and","are computed for each slice t. Figure 1 illustrates why such a modification is useful. It depicts the frequency of the terms neural networks and expert system for each year in a collection of Artificial Intelligence-related dissertation abstracts. Both terms follow a fairly linear trend, moving in opposite directions.","As was demonstrated for CL in Section 1, the terms which best characterize AI have also changed through time. Table 2 lists the top five “rising” and “f alling” bigrams in this corpus, along with their least-squares fit to a linear trend. Lexical variants (such as plurals) are omitted. Using an atemporal TF.IDF, both rising and falling terms would be assigned weights proportional only to",". A novice user issuing a query would be given a temporally random scattering of documents, some of which might be state-of-the-art, others very outdated.","But with TTW, the weights are proportional to the collective “community interest” in the term at a given point in time. In academic research documents, this yields two benefits. If a term rises from obscurity to popularity over the duration of a corpus, it is not unreasonable to assume that this term originated in one or a few seminal articles. The term is not very frequent across documents when these articles are published, so its weight in the seminal articles will be amplified. Similarly, the term will be downweighted in articles when it has become ubiquitous throughout the literature.","For a falling term, its weight in early documents will be dampened, while its later use will be emphasized. If a term is very frequent in a document after it has been relegated to obscurity, this is likely to be an historical review article. Such an article would be a good place to start an investigation for someone who is unfamiliar with the term.

Given this, TTW seems beneficialfor use in information retrieval, but is in an embryonic stage. The next step will be the development and implementation of empirical tests.","IR systems typically are evaluated by measures such as precision and recall, but a different test is necessary to compare TTW to an atemporal TF.IDF. One idea we are exploring is to have a system explicitly tag seminal and historical review articles that are centered around a query term, and then compare the results with those generated by bibliometric methods. Few bibliometric analyses have gone beyond examinations of citation networks and the keywords associated with each article. We would consider the entire text."]},{"title":"3 Time in text categorization","paragraphs":["Text categorization (TC) is the problem of assigning documents to one or more pre-defined categories. As Section 2 demonstrated, the terms which best characterize a category can change through time, so intelligent use of temporal context may prove useful in TC.","Consider the example of sorting newswire documents into the categories ENTERTAINMENT, BUSI-NESS, SPORTS, POLITICS, and WEATHER. Suppose we come across the term athens in a training document. We might expect a fairly uniform distribution of this term throughout the five categories; that is,","","C","athens","= 0.20 for each C. However, in the summer of 2004, we would expect ","","SPORTS","athens","to be greatly increased relative to the other categories due to the city’s hosting of the Olympic games.","Documents with “temporally perturbed” terms like athens contain potentially valuable information, but this is lost in a statistical analysis based purely on the content of each document, irrespec-tive of its temporal context. This information can be recovered with a technique we call temporal feature modification(TFM). We firstoutline a formal model of its use.","Each term k is assumed to have a generator Gk that produces a “true” distribution","","C","k","across all categories. External events at time y can per-","turb k’s generator, causing","","C","k","to be differ-","ent relative to the background","","C","k","computed","over the entire corpus. If the perturbation is sig-","nificant, we want to separate the instances of k","at time y from all other instances. We thus treat","athens and “ athens+summer2004” as though they","were actually different terms, because they came","from two different generators. TFM is a two step process that is captured by","this pseudocode:","VOCABULARY ADDITIONS:","for each class C: for each year y: PreModList(C,y,L) = OddsRatio(C,y,L) ModifyList(y) =","DecisionRule(PreModList(C,y,L)) for each term k in ModifyList(y):","Add pseudo-term \"k+y\" to Vocab","DOCUMENT MODIFICATIONS:","for each document: y = year of doc for each term k:","if \"k+y\" in Vocab:","replace k with \"k+y\" classify modified document","PreModList(C,y,L) is a list of the top L lexemes that, by the odds ratio measure2",", are highly associated with category C in year y. We test the hypothesis that these come from a perturbed generator in year y, as opposed to the atemporal generator Gk, by comparing the odds ratios of term-category pairs in a PreModList in year y with the same pairs across the entire corpus. Terms which pass this test are added to the final ModifyList(y) for year y. For the results that we report, Decision-Rule is a simple ratio test with threshold factor f. Suppose f is 2.0: if the odds ratio between C and k is twice as great in year y as it is atemporally, the decision rule is “passed”. The generator Gkis considered perturbed in year y and k is added to ModifyList(y). In the training and testing phases, the documents are modifiedso that a term k is replaced with the pseudo-term “ k+y” if it passed the ratio test. 3.1 ACM Classifications We tested TFM on corpora representing genres from academic publications to Usenet postings,","2","Odds ratio is definedas",", where p is Pr(k|C), the probability that term k is present given category C, and q is Pr(k|!C).

The results reported here are for abstracts from the proceedings of several of the Association for Computing Machinery’s conferences: SIGCHI, SIGPLAN, and DAC. TFM can benefit the ACM community through retrospective categorization in two ways: (1) 7.73% of abstracts (nearly 6000) across the entire ACM corpus that are expected to have category labels do not have them; (2) When a group of terms becomes popular enough to induce the formation of a new category, a frequent occurrence in the computing literature, TFM would separate the “old” uses from the “ne w” ones.","The ACM classifies its documents in a hierarchy of four levels; we used an aggregating procedure to “flatten” these. The characteristics of each corpus are described in Table 3. The “TC minutiae” used in these experiments are: Stoplist, Porter stemming, 90/10% train/test split, Laplacian smoothing. Parameters such as type of classifier (Naïve Bayes, KNN, TF.IDF, Probabilistic indexing) and threshold factor f were varied. 3.2 Results Figure 2 shows the improvement in classification accuracy for different percentages of terms modified, using the best parameter combinations for each corpus, which are noted in Table 4. A baseline of 0.0 indicates accuracy without any temporal modifications. Despite the relative paucity of data in terms of document length, TFM still performs well on the abstracts. The actual accuracies when no terms are modified are less than stellar, ranging from 30.7% (DAC) to 33.7% (SIGPLAN) when averaged across all conditions, due to the difficulty of the task (20-22 categories; each document can only belong to one). Our aim is simply to show improvement.","In most cases, the technique performs best when 0 5 10 15 20 25−0.05 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 DAC SIGCHI SIGPLAN Percent terms modified Percent accuracy improvement Atemporal baseline Figure 2: Improvement in categorization performance with TFM, using the best parameter combinations for each corpus making relatively few modifications: the left side of Figure 2 shows a rapid performance increase, particularly for SIGCHI, followed by a period of diminishing returns as more terms are modified. After requiring the one-time computation of odds ratios in the training set for each category/year, TFM is very fast and requires negligible extra storage space. 3.3 Future work The “bare bones” version of TFM presented here is intended as a proof-of-concept. Many of the parameters and procedures can be set arbitrarily. For initial feature selection, we used odds ratio because it exhibits good performance in TC (Mladenic, 1998), but it could be replaced by an-other method such as information gain. The ratio test is not a very sophisticated way to choose which terms should be modified, and presently only detects the surges in the use of a term, while ignoring the (admittedly rare) declines.","Using TFM on a Usenet corpus that was more balanced in terms of documents per category and per year, we found that allowing different terms to “compete” for modification was more effective than the egalitarian practice of choosing L terms from each category/year. There is no reason to believe that each category/year is equally likely to contribute temporally perturbed terms.","Finally, we would like to exploit temporal con-Corpus Improvement Classifier n-gram size Vocab frequency min.

The present implementation treats time slices as independent entities, which precludes the possibility of discovering temporal trends in the data. One way to incorporate trends implicitly is to run a smoothing filter across the temporally aligned frequencies. Also, we treat each slice at annual resolution. Initial tests show that aggregating two or more years into one slice improves performance for some corpora, particularly those with temporally sparse data such as DAC."]},{"title":"4 Future work","paragraphs":["A third part of this research program, presently in the exploratory stage, concerns lexical (semantic) change, the broad class of phenomena in which words and phrases are coined or take on new meanings (Bauer, 1994; Jeffers and Lehiste, 1979). Below we describe an application in document clustering and point toward a theoretical framework for lexical change based upon recent advances in network analysis.","Consider a scenario in which a user queries a document database for the term artificial intelligence. We would like to create a system that will cluster the returned documents into three categories, corresponding to the types of change the query has undergone. These responses illustrate the three categories, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive:","1. “This term is now more commonly referred to as AI in this collection”,","2. “These documents are about artificial intelligence, though it is now more commonly called machine learning”,","3. “The following documents are about artificial intelligence, though in this collection its use has become tacit”. 1 2 3 40 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 artificial intelligence AI computer science Frequency per 1000 tokens CS Figure 3: Frequencies in the first(left bar) and second (right bar) halves of an AI discussion forum 4.1 Acronym formation In Section 2, we introduced the notions of “rising” and “f alling” terms. Figure 3 shows relative frequencies of two common terms and their acronyms in the first and second halves of a corpus of AI discussion board postings collected from 1983-1988. While the acronyms increased in frequency, the expanded forms decreased or remained the same. A reasonable conjecture is that in this informal register, the acronyms AI and CS largely replaced the expansions. During the same time period, the more formal register of dissertation abstracts did not show this pattern for any acronym/expansion pairs. 4.2 Lexical replacement Terms can be replaced by their acronyms, or by other terms. In Table 1, database was listed among the top five terms that were most characteristic of the ACL proceedings in 1979-1984. Bisecting this time slice and including bigrams in the analysis, data base ranks higher than database in 1979-1981, but drops much lower in 1982-1984. Within this brief period of time, we see a lexical replacement event taking hold. In the AI dissertation abstracts, artificial intelligence shows the greatest decline, while the conceptually similar terms machine learning and pattern recognition rank sixth and twelfth among the top rising terms.","There are social, geographic, and linguistic forces that influence lexical change. One example stood out as having an easily identified cause: political correctness. In a corpus of dissertation abstracts on communication disorders from 1982-2002, the term subject showed the greatest relative decrease in frequency, while participant showed the greatest increase. Among the top ten bigrams showing the sharpest declines were three terms that included the word impaired and two that included disabled. 4.3 “T acit” vocabulary Another, more subtle lexical change involves the gradual disappearance of terms due to their in-creasingly “tacit” nature within a particular community of discourse. Their existence becomes so obvious that they need not be mentioned within the community, but would be necessary for an outsider to fully understand the discourse.","Take, for example, the terms backpropagation and hidden layer. If a researcher of neural networks uses these terms in an abstract, then neural network does not even warrant printing, because they have come to imply the presence of neural network within this research community.","Applied to IR, one might call this “retrie val by implication”. Discovering tacit terms is no simple matter, as many of them will not follow simple is-a relationships (e.g. terrier is a dog). The example of the previous paragraph seems to contain a hierarchical relation, but it is difficult to define. We believe that examining the temporal trajectories of closely related networks of terms may be of use here, and is also part of a more general project that we hope to undertake. Our intention is to improve existing models of lexical change using recent advances in network analysis (Barabasi et al., 2002; Dorogovtsev and Mendes, 2001)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["A.
