However, little is known about the use of natural language in dialog setting in formal domains, such as mathematics, due to the lack of empirical data. To fill this gap, we collected a corpus of dialogs with a simulated tutorial dialog system for teaching proofs in naive set theory.","An investigation of the corpus reveals various phenomena that present challenges for such input understanding techniques as shallow syntactic analysis combined with keyword spotting, or statistical methods, e.g., Latent Semantic Analysis, which are commonly employed in (tutorial) dialog systems.

An additional methodological desideratum is to provide a uniform treatment of the different degrees of verbalization of the mathematical content. By designing one grammar which allows a uniform treatment of the linguistic content on a par with the mathematical content, one can aim at achieving a consistent analysis void of example-based heuristics. We present such an approach to analysis here.","The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we summarize relevant existing approaches to input analysis in (tutorial) dialog systems on the one hand and analysis of mathematical discourse on the other. Their shortcomings with respect to our setting become clear in Section 3 where we show examples of language phenomena from our dialogs. In Section 4, we propose an analysis methodology that allows us to capture any mixture of natural and mathematical language in a uniform way. We show example analyses in Section 5. In Section 6, we conclude and point out future work issues."]},{"title":"2 Related work","paragraphs":["Language understanding in dialog systems, be it with text or speech interface, is commonly per-formed using shallow syntactic analysis combined with keyword spotting. Tutorial systems also successfully employ statistical methods which compare student responses to a model built from preconstructed gold-standard answers (Graesser et al., 2000). This is impossible for our dialogs, due to the presence of symbolic mathematical expressions. Moreover, the shallow techniques also remain oblivious of such aspects of discourse meaning as causal relations, modality, negation, or scope of quantifierswhich are of crucial importance in our setting. When precise understanding is needed, tutorial systems either use menu- or template-based input, or use closed-questions to elicit short answers of little syntactic variation (Glass, 2001). However, this conflicts with the preference for fle xible dialog in active learning (Moore, 1993).","With regard to interpreting mathematical texts, (Zinn, 2003) and (Baur, 1999) present DRT analyses of course-book proofs. However, the language in our dialogs is more informal: natural language and symbolic mathematical expressions are mixed more freely, there is a higher degree and more variety of verbalization, and mathematical objects are not properly introduced. Moreover, both above approaches rely on typesetting and additional information that identifies mathematical symbols, formulae, and proof steps, whereas our input does not contain any such information. Forcing the user to delimit formulae would reduce the fle xibility of the system, make the interface harder to use, and might not guarantee a clean separation of the natural language and the non-linguistic content anyway."]},{"title":"3 Linguistic data","paragraphs":["In this section, we first briefly describe the corpus collection experiment and then present the common language phenomena found in the corpus. 3.1 Corpus collection 24 subjects with varying educational background and little to fair prior mathematical knowledge participated in a Wizard-of-Oz experiment (Benzmüller et al., 2003b).

This is achieved by the use of one grammar that is capable of analyzing utterances that contain both natural language and mathematical expressions.

The analysis proceeds in 2 stages:","1.

The identified mathematical expressions are subsequently verified as to syntactic validity and categorized. Implementation Identification of mathematical expressions within word-tokenized text is per-formed using simple indicators: single character tokens (with the characters","and","standing for power set and set complement respectively), mathematical symbol unicodes, and new-line characters. The tagger converts the infixnotation used in the input into an expression tree from which the following information is available: surface sub-structure (e.g., “left side” of an expression, list of sub-expressions, list of bracketed sub-expressions) and expression type based on the top level operator (e.g., CONST, TERM, FORMULA 0 FORMULA (formula missing left argument), etc.).","For example, the expression","",""," ","","","","","",") is represented by the formula tree in Fig. 1. The bracket subscripts indicate the operators heading sub-formulae enclosed in parenthesis. Given the expression’s top node operator, =, the expression is of type formula, its “left side” is the expression","","","",", the list","of bracketed sub-expressions includes: A","B, C","D,","","",", etc. Evaluation We have conducted a preliminary evaluation of the mathematical expression parser. Both the student and tutor turns were included to provide more data for the evaluation. Of the 890 mathematical expressions found in the corpus (432 in the student and 458 in the tutor turns), only 9 were incorrectly recognized. The following classes of errors were detected:6","1. P((A","C)","(B C)) =PC","(A","B)","","P((A","C) (B","C))=PC","(A","B)","2. a. (A","U und B U) b. (da ja A","B=",")","","( A","U und B U )","(da ja A","B=",")","3. K((A","B) (C","D)) = K(A ? B) ? K(C ? D)","","K((A B)","(C","D)) = K(A ? B) ? K(C ? D)","4. Gleiches gilt mit D (K(C D))","(K(A","B))","","Gleiches gilt mit D (K(C D))","(K(A","B))","[The same holds with . . . ]","The examples in (1) and (2) have to do with parentheses. In (1), the student actually omitted them. The remedy in such cases is to ask the student to correct the input. In (2), on the other hand, no parentheses are missing, but they are ambiguous between mathematical brackets and parenthet-ical statement markers. The parser mistakenly included one of the parentheses with the mathematical expressions, thereby introducing an error. We could include a list of mathematical operations allowed to be verbalized, in order to include the logical connective in (2a) in the tagged formula. But (2b) shows that this simple solution would not remedy the problem overall, as there is no pattern as to the amount and type of linguistic material accompanying the formulae in parenthesis. We are presently working on ways to identify the two uses of parentheses in a pre-processing step. In (3) the error is caused by a non-standard character, “?”, found in the formula. In (4) the student omitted punctuation causing the character “D” to be interpreted as a non-standard literal for naming an operation on sets. 4.2 Deep analysis The task of the deep parser is to produce a domain-independent linguistic meaning representation of syntactically well-formed sentences and fragments.","By linguistic meaning (LM), we understand the dependency-based deep semantics in the sense of the Prague School notion of sentence meaning as employed in the Functional Generative Description","6","Incorrect tagging is shown along with the correct result be-low it, following an arrow. (FGD) (Sgall et al., 1986; Kruijff, 2001). It represents the literal meaning of the utterance rather than a domain-specific interpretation.7","In FGD, the central frame unit of a sentence/clause is the head verb which specifies the tectogrammatical relations (TRs) of its dependents (participants). Further distinction is drawn into inner participants, such as Actor, Patient, Addressee, and free modifications, such as Location, Means, Direction. Using TRs rather than surface grammatical roles provides a generalized view of the correlations between domain-specific content and its linguistic realiza-tion.","We use a simplifiedset of TRs based on (Hajičová et al., 2000). One reason for simplification is to distinguish which relations are to be understood metaphorically given the domain sub-language. In order to allow for ambiguity in the recognition of TRs, we organize them hierarchically into a taxonomy. The most commonly occurring relations in our context, aside from the inner participant roles of Actor and Patient, are Cause, Condition, and Result-Conclusion (which coincide with the rhetorical relations in the argumentative structure of the proof), for example:","Da [A","","","gilt] CAUSE",", alle x, die in A sind sind nicht in B","[As A","","","applies, all x that are in A are not in B]","Wenn [A",""," ]","COND",", dann A","B=","[If A","","",", then A","B= ]","Da","  ","gilt, [alle x, die in A sind sind nicht in B] RES","Wenn A  ",", dann [A","B=","] RES","Other commonly found TRs include Norm-Criterion, e.g.","[nach deMorgan-Regel-2] NORM","ist","","","","=...)","[according to De Morgan rule 2 it holds that ...]","","","ist [laut DeMorgan-1]","NORM","(  ","","",")","[. . . equals, according to De Morgan rule1, . . . ]","We group other relations into sets of HasProperty, GeneralRelation (for adjectival and clausal modification), and Other (a catch-all category), for example:","dann muessen alla A und B [in C]","PROP-LOC","enthalten sein [then all A and B have to be contained in C]","Alle x, [die in B sind]","GENREL",". . .

More details on the investigation into tectogrammatical relations that build up linguistic meaning of informal mathematical text can be found in (Wolska and Kruijff-Korbayová, 2004a). Implementation The syntactic analysis is per-formed using openCCG8",", an open source parser for Multi-Modal Combinatory Categorial Grammar (MMCCG). MMCCG is a lexicalist grammar formalism in which application of combinatory rules is controlled though context-sensitive specification of modes on slashes (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2003). The linguistic meaning, built in parallel with the syntax, is represented using Hybrid Logic Dependency Semantics (HLDS), a hybrid logic representation which allows a compositional, unification-based construction of HLDS terms with CCG (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2002). An HLDS term is a relational structure where dependency relations between heads and dependents are encoded as modal relations. The syntactic categories for a lexical entry FORMULA, corresponding to mathematical expressions of type “formula”, are",",","",", and",".","For example, in one of the readings of “B enthaelt ","","”, “enthaelt” represents the meaning contain taking dependents in the relations Actor and Patient, shown schematically in Fig. 2. enthalten:contain","FORMULA:","","ACT","FORMULA:","","PAT","Figure 2: Tectogrammatical representation of the","utterance “B enthaelt","  ” [B contains","","]. FORMULA represents the default lexical entry for identified mathematical expressions categorized as “formula” (cf. Section 4.1). The LM is represented by the following HLDS term:","@h1(contain  ACT","(f1","FORMULA:B)","","PAT","(f2","FORMULA:  ) where h1 is the state where the proposition contain is true, and the nominals f1 and f2 represent dependents of the head contain, which stand in the tectogrammatical relations Actor and Patient, respectively.","It is possible to refer to the structural sub-parts of the FORMULA type expressions, as formula sub-parts are identifiedby the tagger, and discourse ref-8 http://openccg.sourceforge.net erents are created for them and stored with the discourse model.","We represent the discourse model within the same framework of hybrid modal logic. Nominals of the hybrid logic object language are atomic formulae that constitute a pointing device to a particular place in a model where they are true. The satisfaction operator, @, allows to evaluate a formula at the point in the model given by a nominal (e.g. the formula @  evaluates ","at the point i). For discourse modeling, we adopt the hybrid logic formalization of the DRT notions in (Kruijff, 2001; Kruijff and Kruijff-Korbayová, 2001). Within this formalism, nominals are interpreted as discourse referents that are bound to propositions through the satisfac-tion operator. In the example above, f1 and f2 represent discourse referents for FORMULA:B and FORMULA:","",", respectively. More technical details on the formalism can be found in the aforementioned publications.","4.3 Domain interpretation","The linguistic meaning representations obtained","from the parser are interpreted with respect to the","domain. We are constructing a domain ontology","that reflects the domain reasoner’s knowledge base,","and is augmented to allow resolution of ambigui-","ties introduced by natural language. For example,","the previously mentioned predicate contain repre-","sents the semantic relation of Containment which,","in the domain of naive set theory, is ambiguous be-","tween the domain relations ELEMENT, SUBSET, and","PROPER SUBSET. The specializations of the am-","biguous semantic relations are encoded in the ontol-","ogy, while a semantic lexicon provides interpreta-","tions of the predicates. At the domain interpretation","stage, the semantic lexicon is consulted to translate","the tectogrammatical frames of the predicates into","the semantic relations represented in the domain on-","tology. More details on the lexical-semantic stage of","interpretation can be found in (Wolska and Kruijff-","Korbayová, 2004b), and more details on the do-","main ontology are presented in (Horacek and Wol-","ska, 2004).","For example, for the predicate contain, the lexi-","con contains the following facts: contain(","","",",","","","",")","","(SUBFORMULA","",", embedding",")","[’a Patient of type FORMULA is a subformula embedded within a FORMULA in the Actor relation with respect to the head contain’] contain(","","",",","","","",")","","CONTAINMENT(container",", containee","",") [’the Containment relation involves a predicate contain and its Actor and Patient dependents, where the Actor and Patient are the container and containee parameters respectively’] Translation rules that consult the ontology expand the meaning of the predicates to all their alternative domain-specific interpretations preserving argument structure.","As it is in the capacity of neither sentence-level nor discourse-level analysis to evaluate the correctness of the alternative interpretations, this task is delegated to the Proof Manager (PM). The task of the PM is to: (A) communicate directly with the theorem prover;9","(B) build and maintain a representation of the proof constructed by the student;10","(C) check type compatibility of proof-relevant entities introduced as new in discourse; (D) check consistency and validity of each of the interpretations constructed by the analysis module, with the proof context; (E) evaluate the proof-relevant part of the utterance with respect to completeness, accuracy, and relevance."]},{"title":"5 Example analysis","paragraphs":["In this section, we illustrate the mechanics of the","approach on the following examples.","(1) B enthaelt kein","","","[B contains no","","","]","(2) A","B"," A B","(3) A enthaelt keinesfalls Elemente, die in B sind.","[A contains no elements that are also in B]","Example (1) shows the tight interaction of natural language and mathematical formulae.

Such utterances are the simplest to analyze: The formulae identified by the mathematical expression tagger are passed directly to the PM.","Example (3) shows an utterance with domain-relevant content fully linguistically verbalized. The analysis of fully verbalized utterances proceeds similarly to the first example: the mathematical expressions are substituted with the appropriate generic lexical entries (here, “A” and “B” are substituted with their three possible alternative readings: CONST, TERM, and FORMULA, yielding several readings “ CONST contains no elements that are also in CONST”, “ TERM contains no elements that are also in TERM”, etc.). Next, the sentence is analyzed by the grammar. The semantic roles of Actor and Patient associated with the verb “contain” are taken by “A” and “elements” respectively; quantifier “no” is in the relation Restrictor with “A”; the relative clause is in the GeneralRelation with “elements”, etc. The linguistic meaning of the utterance in example (3) is shown in Fig. 5. Then, the semantic lexicon and the ontology are consulted to translate the linguistic meaning into its domain-specific interpretations, which are in this case very similar to the ones of example (1)."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions and Further Work","paragraphs":["Based on experimentally collected tutorial dialogs on mathematical proofs, we argued for the use of deep syntactic and semantic analysis. We presented an approach that uses multimodal CCG with hybrid logic dependency semantics, treating natural and symbolic language on a par, thus enabling uniform analysis of inputs with varying degree of formal content verbalization.","A preliminary evaluation of the mathematical expression parser showed a reasonable result. We are incrementally extending the implementation of the deep analysis components, which will be evaluated as part of the next Wizard-of-Oz experiment.","One of the issues to be addressed in this context is the treatment of ill-formed input. On the one hand, the system can initiate a correction subdialog in such cases. On the other hand, it is not desirable to go into syntactic details and distract the student from the main tutoring goal. We therefore need to handle some degree of ill-formed input.","Another question is which parts of mathematical expressions should have explicit semantic representation. We feel that this choice should be motivated empirically, by systematic occurrence of natural language references to parts of mathematical expressions (e.g., “the left/right side”, “the parenthesis”, and “the inner parenthesis”) and by the syntactic contexts in which they occur (e.g., the partitioning ","[x][","A]","seems well motivated in “B contains no x","A”; [x","] is a constituent in “x","of complement of B.”)","We also plan to investigate the interaction of modal verbs with the argumentative structure of the proof. For instance, the necessity modality is compatible with asserting a necessary conclusion or a prerequisite condition (e.g., “A und B muessen disjunkt sein.” [A and B must be disjoint.]). This introduces an ambiguity that needs to be resolved by the domain reasoner."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["J. M. Baldridge and G.J. M. Kruijff. 2002.
