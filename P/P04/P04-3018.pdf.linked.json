We quantify the degree to which gazetteers, web resources, encyclopedia, web documents and web-based query expansion can help Question Answering in general and specific question types in particular. Depending on which resources are used, the QA task may shift from complex answer-findingmechanisms to simpler data extraction methods followed by answer re-mapping in local documents."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["During recent years the Question Answering (QA) fieldhas undergone considerable changes: question types have diversified, question complexity has in-creased, and evaluations have become more standardized - as reflected by the TREC QA track (Voorhees, 2003). Some recent approaches have tapped into external data sources such as the Web, encyclopedias, databases in order to find answer candidates, which may then be located in the specificcorpus being searched (Dumais et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2003). As systems improve, the availability of rich resources will be increasingly critical to QA performance. While on-line resources such as the Web, WordNet, gazetteers, and encyclopedias are becoming more prevalent, no system-independent study has quantified their impact on the QA task. This paper focuses on several resources and their inherent potential to provide answers, without concentrating on a particular QA system or component. The goal is to quantify and bound the potential impact of these resources on the QA process."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["More and more QA systems are using the Web as a resource. Since the Web is orders of magnitude larger than local corpora, redundancy of answers and supporting passages allows systems to produce more correct, confident answers (Clarke et al., 2001; Dumais et al., 2002). (Lin, 2002) presents two different approaches to using the Web: access-ing the structured data and mining the unstructured data. Due to their complementary nature of these approaches, hybrid systems are likely to perform better (Lin and Katz, 2003).","Definitional questions (“What is X?”, “Who is X?” ) are especially compatible with structured resources such as gazetteers and encyclopedias. The top performing definitional systems (Xu et al., 2003) at TREC extract kernel facts similar to a question profile built using structured and semi-structured resources: WordNet (Miller et al., 1990), Merriam-Webster dictionary www.m-w.com), the Columbia Encyclopedia (www.bartleby.com), Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.com), a biography dictionary (www.s9.com) and Google (www.google.com)."]},{"title":"3 Approach","paragraphs":["For the purpose of this paper, resources consist of structured and semi-structured knowledge, such as the Web, web search engines, gazetteers, and encyclopedias. Although many QA systems incorporate or access such resources, few systems quantify in-dividual resource impact on their performance and little work has been done to estimate bounds on resource impact to Question Answering. Independent of a specific QA system, we quantify the degree to which these resources are able to directly provide answers to questions.","Experiments are performed on the 2,393 questions and the corresponding answer keys provided through NIST (Voorhees, 2003) as part of the TREC 8 through TREC 12 evaluations."]},{"title":"4 Gazetteers","paragraphs":["Although the Web consists of mostly unstructured and loosely structured information, the available structured data is a valuable resource for question answering. Gazetteers in particular cover several frequently-asked factoid question types, such as ” What is the population of X?” or ” What is the capital of Y?”. The CIA World Factbook is a database containing geographical, political, and economical profiles of all the countries in the world. We also analyzed two additional data sources containing astronomy information (www.astronomy.com) and detailed information about the fifty US states (www.50states.com).","Since gazetteers provide up-to-date information, some answers will differ from answers in local corpora or the Web. Moreover, questions requir-ing interval-type answers (e.g. “ How close is the sun?”) may not match answers from different sources which are also correct. Gazetteers offer high precision answers, but have limited recall since they only cover a limited number of questions (See Table 1).","CIA All Q-Set #qtions R P R P TREC8 200 4 100% 6 100% TREC9 693 8 100% 22 79% TREC10 500 14 100% 23 96% TREC11 500 8 100% 20 100% TREC12 500 2 100% 11 92% Overall 2393 36 100% 82 91% Table 1: Recall (R): TREC questions can be directly answered directly by gazetteers - shown are results for CIA Factbook and All gazetteers combined.

Since the Web is orders of magnitude larger than local corpora, answers occur frequently in simple contexts, which is more conducive to retrieval and extraction of correct, confident answers (Clarke et al., 2001; Dumais et al., 2002; Lin and Katz, 2003). The web has been employed for pattern acquisition (Ravichandran et al., 2003), document retrieval (Dumais et al., 2002), query expansion (Yang et al., 2003), structured information extraction, and answer validation (Magnini et al., 2002) . Some of these approaches enhance exist-ing QA systems, while others simplify the question answering task, allowing a less complex approach to findcorrect answers. 8.1 Web Documents Instead of searching a local corpus, some QA systems retrieve relevant documents from the web (Xu et al., 2003). Since the density of relevant web documents can be higher than the density of relevant local documents, answer extraction may be more successful from the web. For a TREC evaluation, answers found on the web must also be mapped to relevant documents in the local corpus. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 1000 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 Web Retrieval Performance For QA document rank # questions Correct Doc Density First Correct Doc Figure 1: Web retrieval: relevant document density and rank of firstrelevant document.","In order to evaluate the impact of web documents on TREC questions, we performed an experiment where simple queries were submitted to a web search engine. The questions were to-kenized and filtered using a standard stop word list. The resulting keyword queries were used to retrieve 100 documents through the Google API (www.google.com/api). Documents containing the full question, question number, references to TREC, NIST, AQUAINT, Question Answering and similar content were filteredout.","Figure 1 shows the density of documents containing a correct answer, as well as the rank of the first document containing a correct answer. The simple word query retrieves a relevant document for almost half of the questions. Note that for most systems, the retrieval performance should be superior since queries are usually more refinedand additional query expansion is performed. However, this experiment provides an intuition and a very good lower bound on the precision and density of current web documents for the TREC QA task. 8.2 Web-Based Query Expansion Several QA systems participating at TREC have used search engines for query expansion (Yang et al., 2003). The basic query expansion method utilizes pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) (Xu and Croft, 1996). Content words are selected from questions and submitted as queries to a search engine. The top n retrieved documents are selected, and k terms or phrases are extracted according to an optimization criterion (e.g. term frequency, n-gram frequency, average mutual information using corpus statistics, etc). These k items are used in the expanded query.","We experimented by using the top 5, 10, 15, 20, 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 Answer frequency using PRF # PRF terms","# questions Top 5 documents Top 10 documents Top 15 documents Top 20 documents Top 50 documents Top 100 documents Figure 2: Finding a correct answer in PRF expansion terms - applied to 2183 questions for witch answer keys exist. 50, and 100 documents retrieved via the Google API for each question, and extracted the most frequent fifty n-grams (up to trigrams). The goal was to determine the quality of query expansion as measured by the density of correct answers already present in the expansion terms. Even without filtering n-grams matching the expected answer type, simple PRF produces the correct answer in the top n-grams for more than half the questions. The best correct answer density is achieved using PRF with only 20 web documents. 8.3 Conclusions This paper quantifies the utility of well-known and widely-used resources such as WordNet, encyclopedias, gazetteers and the Web on question answering. The experiments presented in this paper represent loose bounds on the direct use of these resources in answering TREC questions. We reported the performance of these resources on different TREC collec-tions and on different question types. We also quantifiedweb retrieval performance, and confirmedthat the web contains a consistently high density of relevant documents containing correct answers even when simple queries are used. The paper also shows that pseudo-relevance feedback alone using web documents for query expansions can produce a correct answer for fifty percent of the questions examined."]},{"title":"9 Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work was supported in part by the Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA)’s Advanced Question Answering for Intelligence (AQUAINT) Program."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["C.L.A.
