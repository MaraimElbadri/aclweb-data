We achieve this by using simple, easily-elicited knowledge to produce syntax-based heuristics which transform the target language (e.g. English) into a form more closely resembling the source language, and then by using standard alignment methods to align the transformed bitext. We present experimental results under variable resource conditions. The method improves word alignment performance for language pairs such as English-Korean and English-Hindi, which exhibit longer-distance syntactic divergences."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Word-level alignment is a key infrastructural technology for multilingual processing. It is crucial for the development of translation models and translation lexica (Tufiş, 2002; Melamed, 1998), as well as for translingual projection (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Lopez et al., 2002). It has increasingly attracted at-tention as a task worthy of study in its own right (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003; Och and Ney, 2000).","Syntax-light alignment models such as the five IBM models (Brown et al., 1993) and their relatives have proved to be very successful and robust at producing word-level alignments, especially for closely related languages with similar word order and mostly local reorderings, which can be captured via simple models of relative word distortion. However, these models have been less successful at modeling syntactic distortions with longer distance movement. In contrast, more syntactically informed approaches have been constrained by the often weak syntactic correspondences typical of real-world parallel texts, and by the difficulty of finding or induc-ing syntactic parsers for any but a few of the world’s most studied languages.","Our approach uses simple, easily-elicited knowledge of divergences to produce heuristic syntax-based transformations from English to a form (English′",") more closely resembling the source lan-English Transform Traces Retrace Source |\\| English English’ Run GIZA++ Source |/ | English’ Source","Language-specific Heuristics Figure 1: System Architecture guage, and then using standard alignment methods to align the transformed version to the target language. This approach retains the robustness of syntactically agnostic models, while taking advantage of syntactic knowledge. Because the approach relies only on syntactic analysis of English, it can avoid the difficulty of developing a full parser for a new low-resource language.","Our method is rapid and low cost. It requires only coarse-grained knowledge of basic word order, knowledge which can be rapidly found in even the briefest grammatical sketches. Because basic word order changes very slowly with time, word order of related languages tends to be very similar. For example, even if we only know that a language is of the Northern-Indian/Sanskrit family, we can easily guess with high confidence that it is systematically head-final. Because our method can be restricted to only bi-text pre-processing and post-processing, it can be used as a wrapper around any existing word-alignment tool, without modification, to provide improved performance by minimizing alignment distortion."]},{"title":"2 Prior Work","paragraphs":["The 2003 HLT-NAACL Workshop on Building and Using Parallel Texts (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003) reflected the increasing importance of the word-alignment task, and established standard performance measures and some benchmark tasks.","There is prior work studying systematic cross-"]},{"title":"English: Hindi:","paragraphs":["use of plutonium is to manufacture nuclear weapons plutoniyama kaa ’s istemaala use paramaanu nuclear hathiyaara banaane manufacture ke lie hotaa hai is the NP NP PP S VP VP VP NP plutonium weapons to Figure 2: Original Hindi-English sentence pair with gold-standard word-alignments."]},{"title":"English’: Hindi:","paragraphs":["plutoniyama plutonium kaa ’s istemaala use paramaanu nuclear hathiyaara banaane ke lie hotaa hai is plutonium of the use nuclear weapons manufacture to is S VP PP NP VP VP NP NP weapons manufacture to Figure 3: Transformed Hindi-English′","sentence pair with gold-standard word-alignments.

While the focus on major classes of structural variation such as manner-of-motion verb-phrase transformations have facilitated both transfer and generation in machine translation, these divergences have not been integrated into a system that produces automatic word alignments and have tended to focus on more local phrasal variation rather than more comprehensive sentential syntactic reordering.","Complementary prior work (e.g. Wu, 1995) has also addressed syntactic transduction for bilingual parsing, translation, and word-alignment. Much of this work depends on high-quality parsing of both target and source sentences, which may be unavailable for many “lower density” languages of interest. Tree-to-string models, such as (Yamada and Knight, 2001) remove this dependency, and such models are well suited for situations with large, cleanly translated training corpora. By contrast, our method retains the robustness of the underlying aligner to-wards loose translations, and can if necessary use knowledge of syntactic divergences even in the absence of any training corpora whatsoever, using only a translation lexicon."]},{"title":"3 System","paragraphs":["Figure 1 shows the system architecture.
