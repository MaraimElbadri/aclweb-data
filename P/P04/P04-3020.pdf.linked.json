In short, a graph-based ranking algorithm is a way of deciding on the importance of a vertex within a graph, by taking into account global information recursively computed from the entire graph, rather than relying only on local vertex-specific information.","A similar line of thinking can be applied to lexical or semantic graphs extracted from natural language documents, resulting in a graph-based ranking model called TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), which can be used for a variety of natural language process-ing applications where knowledge drawn from an entire text is used in making local ranking/selection decisions. Such text-oriented ranking methods can be applied to tasks ranging from automated extraction of keyphrases, to extractive summarization and word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea et al., 2004).","In this paper, we investigate a range of graph-based ranking algorithms, and evaluate their application to automatic unsupervised sentence extraction in the context of a text summarization task. We show that the results obtained with this new unsupervised method are competitive with previously developed state-of-the-art systems."]},{"title":"2 Graph-Based Ranking Algorithms","paragraphs":["Graph-based ranking algorithms are essentially a way of deciding the importance of a vertex within a graph, based on information drawn from the graph structure. In this section, we present three graph-based ranking algorithms – previously found to be successful on a range of ranking problems. We also show how these algorithms can be adapted to undirected or weighted graphs, which are particularly useful in the context of text-based ranking applications. Let G = (V; E) be a directed graph with the set of vertices V and set of edges E, where E is a subset of V V . For a given vertex Vi, let In(Vi) be the set of vertices that point to it (predecessors), and let Out(Vi) be the set of vertices that vertex Vi points to (successors). 2.1 HITS HITS (Hyperlinked Induced Topic Search) (Kleinberg, 1999) is an iterative algorithm that was designed for ranking Web pages according to their degree of “authority”. The HITS algorithm makes a distinction between “authorities” (pages with a large number of incoming links) and “hubs” (pages with a large number of outgoing links). For each vertex, HITS produces two sets of scores – an “authority” score, and a “hub” score: HIT SA(Vi) = X V j∈In(V","i) HIT SH(Vj) (1) HIT SH(Vi) = X V j∈Out(V","i) HIT SA(Vj) (2) 2.2 Positional Power Function Introduced by (Herings et al., 2001), the positional power function is a ranking algorithm that determines the score of a vertex as a function that combines both the number of its successors, and the score of its successors. P OSP (Vi) = 1 jV j X V j∈Out(V","i) (1 + P OSP (Vj)) (3) The counterpart of the positional power function is the positional weakness function, definedas: P OSW (Vi) = 1 jV j X V j∈In(V","i) (1 + P OSW (Vj)) (4) 2.3 PageRank PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) is perhaps one of the most popular ranking algorithms, and was designed as a method for Web link analysis. Unlike other ranking algorithms, PageRank integrates the impact of both incoming and outgoing links into one single model, and therefore it produces only one set of scores: P R(Vi) = (1 d) + d X V j∈In(V","i) P R(Vj) jOut(Vj)j (5) where d is a parameter that is set between 0 and 1 1",". For each of these algorithms, starting from arbitrary values assigned to each node in the graph, the computation iterates until convergence below a given threshold is achieved. After running the algorithm, a score is associated with each vertex, which represents the “importance” or “po wer” of that vertex within the graph. Notice that the final values are not affected by the choice of the initial value, only the number of iterations to convergence may be different. 2.4 Undirected Graphs Although traditionally applied on directed graphs, recursive graph-based ranking algorithms can be also applied to undirected graphs, in which case the outdegree of a vertex is equal to the in-degree of the vertex. For loosely connected graphs, with the number of edges proportional with the number of vertices, undirected graphs tend to have more gradual convergence curves. As the connectivity of the graph increases (i.e. larger number of edges), convergence is usually achieved after fewer iterations, and the convergence curves for directed and undirected graphs practically overlap. 2.5 Weighted Graphs In the context of Web surfing or citation analysis, it is unusual for a vertex to include multiple or partial links to another vertex, and hence the original defini-tion for graph-based ranking algorithms is assuming unweighted graphs.","However, in our TextRank model the graphs are build from natural language texts, and may include multiple or partial links between the units (vertices) that are extracted from text. It may be therefore useful to indicate and incorporate into the model the “strength” of the connection between two vertices Vi and Vj as a weight wij added to the corresponding edge that connects the two vertices.","Consequently, we introduce new formulae for graph-based ranking that take into account edge weights when computing the score associated with a vertex in the graph. 1 The factor d is usually set at 0.85 (Brin and Page, 1998), and","this is the value we are also using in our implementation.","HIT SW A (Vi) = X V j∈In(V","i)","wjiHIT SW H (Vj) (6)","HIT SW H (Vi) = X V j∈Out(V","i)","wijHIT SW A (Vj) (7)","P OSW P (Vi) = 1 jV j X V j∈Out(V","i)","(1 + wijP OSW P (Vj)) (8)","P OSW W (Vi) = 1 jV j X V j∈In(V","i)","(1 + wjiP OSW W (Vj)) (9)","P RW (V i) = (1 d) + d X V j∈In(V","i) wji P RW","(Vj) P V k∈Out(V","j) wkj (10)","While the final vertex scores (and therefore rank-ings) for weighted graphs differ significantly as compared to their unweighted alternatives, the number of iterations to convergence and the shape of the convergence curves is almost identical for weighted and unweighted graphs."]},{"title":"3 Sentence Extraction","paragraphs":["To enable the application of graph-based ranking algorithms to natural language texts, TextRank starts by building a graph that represents the text, and interconnects words or other text entities with meaningful relations. For the task of sentence extraction, the goal is to rank entire sentences, and therefore a vertex is added to the graph for each sentence in the text.","To establish connections (edges) between sentences, we are defining a “similarity” relation, where “similarity” is measured as a function of content overlap. Such a relation between two sentences can be seen as a process of “recommendation”: a sentence that addresses certain concepts in a text, gives the reader a “recommendation” to refer to other sentences in the text that address the same concepts, and therefore a link can be drawn between any two such sentences that share common content.","The overlap of two sentences can be determined simply as the number of common tokens between the lexical representations of the two sentences, or it can be run through syntactic filters,which only count words of a certain syntactic category. Moreover, to avoid promoting long sentences, we are using a normalization factor, and divide the content overlap of two sentences with the length of each sentence. Formally, given two sentences Si and Sj, with a sentence being represented by the set of Ni words that appear in the sentence: Si = W i","1; W i","2; :::; W i","Ni , the similarity of Si and Sj is definedas: Similarity(Si; Sj) = jWkjWk2Si&Wk2Sjj log(jSij)+log(jSjj)","The resulting graph is highly connected, with a weight associated with each edge, indicating the strength of the connections between various sentence pairs in the text2",". The text is therefore represented as a weighted graph, and consequently we are using the weighted graph-based ranking formulae introduced in Section 2.5. The graph can be represented as: (a) simple undirected graph; (b) directed weighted graph with the orientation of edges set from a sentence to sentences that follow in the text (directed forward); or (c) directed weighted graph with the orientation of edges set from a sentence to previous sentences in the text (directed backward).","After the ranking algorithm is run on the graph, sentences are sorted in reversed order of their score, and the top ranked sentences are selected for inclusion in the summary.","Figure 1 shows a text sample, and the associated weighted graph constructed for this text. The figure also shows sample weights attached to the edges connected to vertex 93",", and the final score computed for each vertex, using the PR formula, applied on an undirected graph. The sentences with the highest rank are selected for inclusion in the abstract. For this sample article, sentences with id-s 9, 15, 16, 18 are extracted, resulting in a summary of about 100 words, which according to automatic evaluation measures, is ranked the second among summaries produced by 15 other systems (see Section 4 for evaluation methodology)."]},{"title":"4 Evaluation","paragraphs":["The TextRank sentence extraction algorithm is evaluated in the context of a single-document summarization task, using 567 news articles provided during the Document Understanding Evaluations 2002 (DUC, 2002). For each article, TextRank generates a 100-words summary — the task undertaken by other systems participating in this single document summarization task.","For evaluation, we are using the ROUGE evaluation toolkit, which is a method based on Ngram statistics, found to be highly correlated with human evaluations (Lin and Hovy, 2003a). Two manually produced reference summaries are provided, and used in the evaluation process4",".","2","In single documents, sentences with highly similar content are very rarely if at all encountered, and therefore sentence redundancy does not have a significant impact on the summarization of individual texts. This may not be however the case with multiple document summarization, where a redundancy removal technique – such as a maximum threshold imposed on the sentence similarity – needs to be implemented.","3","Weights are listed to the right or above the edge they correspond to. Similar weights are computed for each edge in the graph, but are not displayed due to space restrictions.","4","The evaluation is done using the Ngram(1,1) setting of ROUGE, which was found to have the highest correlation with human judgments, at a confidence level of 95%.

Unlike other supervised systems, which attempt to learn what makes a good summary by training on collections of summaries built for other articles, TextRank is fully unsupervised, and relies only on the given text to derive an extractive summary.","Among all algorithms, the HIT SA and P ageRank algorithms provide the best performance, at par with the best performing system from DUC 20025",". This proves that graph-based ranking algorithms, previously found successful in Web link analysis, can be turned into a state-of-the-art tool for sentence extraction when applied to graphs extracted from texts.","Notice that TextRank goes beyond the sentence “connecti vity” in a text. For instance, sentence 15 in the example provided in Figure 1 would not be identified as “important” based on the number of connections it has with other vertices in the graph6",", but it is identifiedas “important” by TextRank (and by humans – according to the reference summaries for this text).","Another important advantage of TextRank is that it gives a ranking over all sentences in a text – which means that it can be easily adapted to extracting very short summaries, or longer more explicative summaries, consisting of more than 100 words."]},{"title":"5 Related Work","paragraphs":["Sentence extraction is considered to be an important firststep for automatic text summarization.

It is also notable the study reported in (Lin and Hovy, 2003b) discussing the usefulness and limitations of automatic sentence extraction for summarization, which emphasizes the need of accurate tools for sentence extraction, as an integral part of automatic summarization systems."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions","paragraphs":["Intuitively, TextRank works well because it does not only rely on the local context of a text unit (vertex), but rather it takes into account information recursively drawn from the entire text (graph). Through the graphs it builds on texts, TextRank identifies connections between various entities in a text, and implements the concept of recommendation. A text unit recommends other related text units, and the strength of the recommendation is recursively computed based on the importance of the units making the recommendation. In the process of identifying important sentences in a text, a sentence recommends another sentence that addresses similar concepts as being useful for the overall understanding of the text. Sentences that are highly recommended by other sentences are likely to be more informative for the given text, and will be therefore given a higher score.","An important aspect of TextRank is that it does not require deep linguistic knowledge, nor domain or language specific annotated corpora, which makes it highly portable to other domains, genres, or languages."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["S.
