We employ a generative model that generates a paraphrase of a given sentence, and we use probabilistic inference to reason about whether two sentences share the paraphrase relationship. The model cleanly incorporates both syntax and lexical semantics using quasi-synchronous dependency grammars (Smith and Eisner, 2006). Furthermore, using a product of experts (Hinton, 2002), we combine the model with a complementary logistic regression model based on state-of-the-art lexical overlap features.

For computational linguists, solving this problem may shed light on how best to model the semantics of sentences. For natural language engineers, the problem bears on information management systems like abstractive summarizers that must measure semantic overlap between sentences (Barzilay and Lee, 2003), question answering modules (Marsi and Krahmer, 2005) and machine translation (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).","The paraphrase identification problem asks whether two sentences have essentially the same meaning. Although paraphrase identification is defined in semantic terms, it is usually solved using statistical classifiers based on shallow lexical, n-gram, and syntactic “overlap” features. Such overlap features give the best-published classification accuracy for the paraphrase identification task (Zhang and Patrick, 2005; Finch et al., 2005; Wan et al., 2006; Corley and Mihalcea, 2005, in-ter alia), but do not explicitly model correspondence structure (or “alignment”) between the parts of two sentences. In this paper, we adopt a model that posits correspondence between the words in the two sentences, defining it in loose syntactic terms: if two sentences are paraphrases, we expect their dependency trees to align closely, though some divergences are also expected, with some more likely than others. Following Smith and Eisner (2006), we adopt the view that the syntactic structure of sentences paraphrasing some sentence s should be “inspired” by the structure of s.","Because dependency syntax is still only a crude approximation to semantic structure, we augment the model with a lexical semantics component, based on WordNet (Miller, 1995), that models how words are probabilistically altered in generating a paraphrase. This combination of loose syntax and lexical semantics is similar to the “Jeopardy” model of Wang et al. (2007).","This syntactic framework represents a major departure from useful and popular surface similarity features, and the latter are difficult to incorporate into our probabilistic model. We use a product of experts (Hinton, 2002) to bring together a logistic regression classifier built fromn-gram overlap features and our syntactic model. This combined model leverages complementary strengths of the two approaches, outperforming a strong state-of-the-art baseline (Wan et al., 2006).","This paper is organized as follows. We introduce our probabilistic model in §2. The model makes use of three quasi-synchronous grammar models (Smith and Eisner, 2006, QG, hereafter) as components (one modeling paraphrase, one modeling not-paraphrase, and one a base grammar); these are detailed, along with latent-variable inference and discriminative training algorithms, in §3. We discuss the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus, upon which we conduct experiments, in §4. In §5, we present experiments on paraphrase 468 identification with our model and make comparisons with the existing state-of-the-art. We describe the product of experts and our lexical overlap model, and discuss the results achieved in §6. We relate our approach to prior work (§7) and conclude (§8)."]},{"title":"2 Probabilistic Model","paragraphs":["Since our task is a classification problem, we require our model to provide an estimate of the posterior probability of the relationship (i.e., “paraphrase,” denoted p, or “not paraphrase,” denoted n), given the pair of sentences.1","Here, p","Q denotes model probabilities, c is a relationship class (p or n), and s1 and s2 are the two sentences. We choose the class according to:","ĉ = argmax c∈{p,n} pQ(c | s1, s2)","= argmax c∈{p,n} pQ(c) × pQ(s1, s2 | c) (1)","We define the class-conditional probabilities of the two sentences using the following generative story. First, grammar G0 generates a sentence s. Then a class c is chosen, corresponding to a class-specificprobabilistic quasi-synchronous grammar Gc. (We will discuss QG in detail in §3. For the present, consider it a specially-defined probabilistic model that generates sentences with a specific property, like “paraphrases s,” when c = p.) Given s, Gc generates the other sentence in the pair, s′",".","When we observe a pair of sentences s1 and s2 we do not presume to know which came first (i.e., which was s and which was s′","). Both orderings are assumed to be equally probable. For class c, pQ(s1, s2 | c) = 0.5 × pQ(s1 | G0) × pQ(s2 | Gc(s1)) + 0.5 × pQ(s2 | G0) × pQ(s1 | Gc(s2))(2) where c can be p or n; Gp(s) is the QG that generates paraphrases for sentence s, while Gn(s) is the QG that generates sentences that are not paraphrases of sentence s. This latter model may seem counter-intuitive: since the vast majority of possible sentences are not paraphrases of s, why is a special grammar required? Our use of a Gn follows from the properties of the corpus currently used for learning, in which the negative examples","1","Although we do not explore the idea here, the model could be adapted for other sentence-pair relationships like entailment or contradiction. were selected to have high lexical overlap. We return to this point in §4."]},{"title":"3 QG for Paraphrase Modeling","paragraphs":["Here, we turn to the models Gp and Gn in detail. 3.1 Background Smith and Eisner (2006) introduced the quasi-synchronous grammar formalism. Here, we describe some of its salient aspects. The model arose out of the empirical observation that translated sentences have some isomorphic syntactic structure, but divergences are possible. Therefore, rather than an isomorphic structure over a pair of source and target sentences, the syntactic tree over a target sentence is modeled by a source sentence-specific grammar “inspired” by the source sentence’s tree. This is implemented by associating with each node in the target tree a subset of the nodes in the source tree. Since it loosely links the two sentences’ syntactic structures, QG is well suited for problems like word alignment for MT (Smith and Eisner, 2006) and question answering (Wang et al., 2007).","Consider a very simple quasi-synchronous context-free dependency grammar that generates one dependent per production rule.2","Let s = ⟨s1, ..., sm⟩ be the source sentence. The grammar rules will take one of the two forms:","⟨t, l⟩ → ⟨t, l⟩⟨t′ , k⟩ or ⟨t, l⟩ → ⟨t′",", k⟩⟨t, l⟩ where t and t′","range over the vocabulary of the target language, and l and k ∈ {0, ..., m} are indices in the source sentence, with 0 denoting null.3 Hard or soft constraints can be applied between l and k in a rule. These constraints imply permissible “configurations.” For example, requiring l ̸= 0 and, if k ̸= 0 then sk must be a child of sl in the source tree, we can implement a synchronous dependency grammar similar to (Melamed, 2004).","Smith and Eisner (2006) used a quasi-synchronous grammar to discover the correspondence between words implied by the correspondence between the trees. We follow Wang et al. (2007) in treating the correspondences as latent variables, and in using a WordNet-based lexical semantics model to generate the target words.","2","Our actual model is more complicated; see §3.2.","3","A more general QG could allow one-to-many alignments, replacing l and k with sets of indices. 469 3.2 Detailed Model We describe how we model pQ(t | Gp(s)) and pQ(t | Gn(s)) for source and target sentences s and t (appearing in Eq. 2 alternately as s1 and s2).","A dependency tree on a sequence w = ⟨w1, ..., wk⟩ is a mapping of indices of words to indices of syntactic parents, τp : {1, ..., k} → {0, ..., k}, and a mapping of indices of words to dependency relation types in L, τl : {1, ..., k} → L. The set of indices children of wi to its left, {j : τ w","(j) = i, j < i}, is denoted λw","(i), and ρw","(i) is used for right children. w","i has a single parent, denoted by wτp(i). Cycles are not allowed, and w0 is taken to be the dummy “wall” symbol, $, whose only child is the root word of the sentence (normally the main verb). The label for wi is denoted by τl(i). We denote the whole tree of a sentence w by τ w",", the subtree rooted at the ith word by τ w,i",".","Consider two sentences: let the source sentence s contain m words and the target sentence t contain n words. Let the correspondence x : {1, ..., n} → {0, ..., m} be a mapping from indices of words in t to indices of words in s. (We require each target word to map to at most one source word, though multiple target words can map to the same source word, i.e., x(i) = x(j) while i ̸= j.) When x(i) = 0, the ith target word maps to the wall symbol, equivalently a “null” word. Each of our QGs Gp and Gn generates the alignments x, the target tree τ t",", and the sentence t. Both Gp and Gn are structured in the same way, differing only in their parameters; henceforth we discuss Gp; Gn is similar.","We assume that the parse trees of s and t are known.4","Therefore our model defines:","pQ(t | Gp(s)) = p(τ t","| G","p(τ s )) =","∑ x p(τ t",", x | G","p(τ s )) (3) Because the QG is essentially a context-free dependency grammar, we can factor it into recursive steps as follows (let i be an arbitrary index in {1, ..., n}): P (τ t,i","| ti, x(i), τ s",") = p","val (|λt","(i)|, |ρt","(i)| | ti)","4","In our experiments, we use the parser described by Mc-Donald et al.

(The same treebank data were also to estimate many of the parameters of our model, as discussed in the text.)

For unobserved cases, the conditional probability is estimated by backing off to the parent POS tag and child direction.","We discuss next how to parameterize the probability pkid that appears in Equations 4, 5, and 6. This conditional distribution forms the core of our QGs, and we deviate from earlier research using QGs in definingpkid in a fully generative way.","In addition to assuming that dependency parse trees for s and t are observable, we also assume each word wi comes with POS and named entity tags. In our experiments these were obtained automatically using MXPOST (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and BBN’s Identifinder (Bikel et al., 1999). 470","For clarity, let j = τ t p (i) and let l = x(j).","pkid(ti, τ t l (i), x(i) | tj, l, τ s",") =","pconfig (config(ti, tj, sx(i), sl) | tj, l, τ s",") (7) ×punif (x(i) | config(ti, tj, sx(i), sl)) (8) ×plab(τ t","l (i) | config(ti, tj, sx(i), sl)) (9) ×ppos (pos(ti) | pos(sx(i))) (10) ×pne (ne(ti) | ne(sx(i))) (11) ×plsrel (lsrel (ti) | sx(i)) (12) ×pword (ti | lsrel (ti), sx(i)) (13) We consider each of the factors above in turn.

The corpus contains 5,801 pairs of sentences that have been marked as “equivalent” or “not equivalent.” It was constructed from thousands of news sources on the web. Dolan and Brockett (2005) remark that this corpus was created semi-automatically by first training an SVM classifier on a disjoint annotated 10,000 sentence pair dataset and then applying the SVM on an unseen 49,375 sentence pair corpus, with its output probabilities skewed towards over-identification, i.e., towards generating some false paraphrases. 5,801 out of these 49,375 pairs were randomly selected and presented to human judges for refinement into true and false paraphrases. 3,900 of the pairs were marked as having 472 About 120 potential jurors were being asked to complete a lengthy questionnaire .","The jurors were taken into the courtroom in groups of 40 and asked to fill out a questionnaire .

Ex. 19 is another true paraphrase pair with much lower lexical overlap (unigram overlap of 50% in one direction and 30% in the other). Notice the use of similar-meaning phrases and irrelevant modifiers that retain the same mean-ing in both sentences, which a lexical overlap model cannot capture easily, but a model like a QG might. Also, in both pairs, the relationship cannot be called total bidirectional equivalence because there is some extra information in one sentence which cannot be inferred from the other.","Ex. 20 was labeled “not paraphrase”:","(20) “There were a number of bureaucratic and administrative missed signals - there’s not one person who’s responsible here,” Gehman said.

It means that any discriminative model is expected to learn to distinguish mere overlap from paraphrase.

The lexical semantics component is critical, as seen by the drop in accuracy from the table (without this component, pQ behaves almost like the “all p” baseline). We found that the most important configurations are “parent-child,” and “child-parent” while damage from ablating other configurations is relatively small. Most interestingly, disallowing the “c-command” configuration resulted in the best absolute accuracy, giving us the best version of pQ. The c-command configuration allows more distant nodes in a source sentence to align to parent-child pairs in a target (see Fig. 1d). Allowing this configuration guides the model in the wrong direction, thus reducing test accuracy. We tried disallowing more than one configuration at a time, without getting improvements on development data. We also tried ablating the WordNet relations, and observed that the “identical-word” feature hurt the model the most. Ablating the rest of the features did not produce considerable changes in accuracy.","The development data-selected pQ achieves higher recall by 1 point than Wan et al.’s SVM, but has precision 2 points worse. 5.3 Discussion It is quite promising that a linguistically-motivated probabilistic model comes so close to a string-similarity baseline, without incorporating stringlocal phrases.

First, the QG discovers hidden alignments between words. Alignments have been leveraged in related tasks such as textual entailment (Giampiccolo et al., 2007); they make the model more interpretable in analyzing system output (e.g., Fig. 2). Second, the paraphrases of a sentence can be considered to be monolingual translations. We model the paraphrase problem using a direct machine translation model, thus providing a translation in-terpretation of the problem. This framework could be extended to permit paraphrase generation, or to exploit other linguistic annotations, such as representations of semantics (see, e.g., Qiu et al., 2006).","Nonetheless, the usefulness of surface overlap features is difficult to ignore. We next provide an efficient way to combine a surface model withpQ."]},{"title":"6 Product of Experts","paragraphs":["Incorporating structural alignment and surface overlap features inside a single model can make exact inference infeasible. As an example, consider features like n-gram overlap percentages that provide cues of content overlap between two sentences. One intuitive way of including these features in a QG could be including these only at the root of the target tree, i.e. while calculating C(r, 0). These features have to be included in estimating pkid, which has log-linear component models (Eq. 7- 13). For these bigram or trigram overlap features, a similar log-linear model has to be normalized with a partition function, which considers the (unnormalized) scores of all possible target sentences, given the source sentence.","We therefore combine pQ with a lexical overlap model that gives another posterior probability estimate pL(c | s1, s2) through a product of experts (PoE; Hinton, 2002), pJ (c | s1, s2) =","pQ(c | s1, s2) × pL(c | s1, s2) ∑ c′ ∈{p,n}","pQ(c′ | s","1, s2) × pL(c′ | s 1, s2) (21) 474 Eq. 21 takes the product of the two models’ posterior probabilities, then normalizes it to sum to one. PoE models are used to efficiently combine several expert models that individually constrain different dimensions in high-dimensional data, the product therefore constraining all of the dimensions. Combining models in this way grants to each expert component model the ability to “veto” a class by giving it low probability; the most probable class is the one that is least objectionable to all experts. Probabilistic Lexical Overlap Model We devised a logistic regression (LR) model incorporating 18 simple features, computed directly from s1 and s2, without modeling any hidden correspondence. LR (like the QG) provides a probability distribution, but uses surface features (like the SVM). The features are of the form precisionn (number of n-gram matches divided by the number of n-grams in s1), recall n (number of n-gram matches divided by the number of n-grams in s2) and Fn (harmonic mean of the previous two features), where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. We also used lemmatized versions of these features. This model gives the posterior probability pL(c | s1, s2), where c ∈ {p, n}. We estimated the model parameters analogously to Eq. 17. Performance is reported in Tab. 2; this model is on par with the SVM, though trading recall in favor of precision. We view it as a probabilistic simulation of the SVM more suitable for combination with the QG. Training the PoE Various ways of training a PoE exist. We first trained pQ and pL separately as described, then initialized the PoE with those parameters. We then continued training, maximizing (unregularized) conditional likelihood. Experiment We used pQ with the “c-command” configuration excluded, and the LR model in the product of experts. Tab. 2 includes the final results achieved by the PoE. The PoE model outperforms all the other models, achieving an accuracy of 76.06%.11","The PoE is conservative, labeling a pair as p only if the LR and the QG give it strong p probabilities. This leads to high precision, at the expense of recall. Oracle Ensembles Tab. 2 shows the results of three different oracle ensemble systems that correctly classify a pair if either of the two individual systems in the combination is correct. Note that the combinations involving pQ achieve 83%, the 11 This accuracy is significant overpQ under a paired t-test","(p < 0.04), but is not significant over the SVM. human agreement level for the MSRPC. The LR and SVM are highly similar, and their oracle combination does not perform as well."]},{"title":"7 Related Work","paragraphs":["There is a growing body of research that uses the MSRPC (Dolan et al., 2004; Quirk et al., 2004) to build models of paraphrase. As noted, the most successful work has used edit distance (Zhang and Patrick, 2005) or bag-of-words features to measure sentence similarity, along with shallow syntactic features (Finch et al., 2005; Wan et al., 2006; Corley and Mihalcea, 2005). Qiu et al. (2006) used predicate-argument annotations.","Most related to our approach, Wu (2005) used inversion transduction grammars—a synchronous context-free formalism (Wu, 1997)—for this task. Wu reported only positive-class (p) precision (not accuracy) on the test set. He obtained 76.1%, while our PoE model achieves 79.6% on that measure. Wu’s model can be understood as a strict hierarchical maximum-alignment method. In contrast, our alignments are soft (we sum over them), and we do not require strictly isomorphic syntactic structures. Most importantly, our approach is founded on a stochastic generating process and estimated discriminatively for this task, while Wu did not estimate any parameters from data at all."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have presented a probabilistic model of paraphrase incorporating syntax, lexical semantics, and hidden loose alignments between two sentences’ trees. Though it fully defines a generative process for both sentences and their relationship, the model is discriminatively trained to maximize conditional likelihood. We have shown that this model is competitive for determining whether there exists a semantic relationship between them, and can be improved by principled combination with more standard lexical overlap approaches."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The authors thank the three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and Alan Black, Frederick Crabbe, Jason Eisner, Kevin Gimpel, Rebecca Hwa, David Smith, and Mengqiu Wang for helpful discussions.
