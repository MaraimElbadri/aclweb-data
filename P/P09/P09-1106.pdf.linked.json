Then we propose a method to build the confusion network from intersection word alignment, which utilizes both direct and inverse word alignment between the backbone and hypothesis to improve the reliability of hypothesis alignment.

Confusion network based system combination for machine translation has shown promising advantage compared with other techniques based system combination, such as sentence level hypothesis selection by voting and source sentence re-decoding using the phrases or translation models that are learned from the source sentences and target hypotheses pairs (Rosti et al., 2007a; Huang and Papineni, 2007).","In general, the confusion network based system combination method for MT consists of four steps: 1) Backbone selection: to select a backbone (also called “skeleton”) from all hypotheses. The backbone defines the word orders of the final translation. 2) Hypothesis alignment: to build word-alignment between backbone and each hypothesis. 3) Confusion network construction: to build a confusion network based on hypothesis alignments. 4) Confusion network decoding: to decode the best translation from a confusion network. Among the four steps, the hypothesis alignment presents the biggest challenge to the method due to the varying word orders between outputs from different MT systems (Rosti et al, 2007). Many techniques have been studied to address this issue. Bangalore et al. (2001) used the edit distance alignment algorithm which is extended to multiple strings to build confusion network, it only allows monotonic alignment. Jayaraman and Lavie (2005) proposed a heuristic-based matching algorithm which allows nonmonotonic alignments to align the words between the hypotheses. More recently, Matusov et al. (2006, 2008) used GIZA++ to produce word alignment for hypotheses pairs. Sim et al. (2007), Rosti et al. (2007a), and Rosti et al. (2007b) used minimum Translation Error Rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006) alignment to build the confusion network. Rosti et al. (2008) extended TER algorithm which allows a confusion network as the reference to compute word alignment. Karakos et al. (2008) used ITG-based method for hypothesis alignment. Chen et al. (2008) used Competitive Linking Algorithm (CLA) (Melamed, 2000) to align the words to construct confusion network. Ayan et al. (2008) proposed to improve alignment of hypotheses using synonyms as found in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and a two-pass alignment strategy based on TER word alignment approach. He et al. (2008) proposed an IHMM-based word alignment method which the parameters are estimated indirectly from a variety of sources.","Although many methods have been attempted, no systematic comparison among them has been reported. A through and fair comparison among them would be of great meaning to the MT sys-941 tem combination research. In this paper, we implement a confusion network-based decoder. Based on this decoder, we compare four commonly used word alignment methods (GIZA++, TER, CLA and IHMM) for hypothesis alignment using the same experimental data and the same multiple MT system outputs with similar features in terms of translation performance. We conduct the comparison study and other experiments in this paper on both spoken and newswire domains: Chinese-to-English spoken and written language translation tasks. Our comparison shows that although the performance differences between the four methods are not significant, IHMM consistently show slightly better performance than other methods. This is mainly due to the fact the IHMM is able to explore more knowledge sources and Viterbi decoding used in IHMM allows more thorough search for the best alignment while other methods has to use less optimal greedy search.","In addition, for better performance, instead of only using one direction word alignment (n-to-1 from hypothesis to backbone) as in previous work, we propose to use more reliable word alignments which are derived from the intersection of two-direction hypothesis alignment to construct confusion network. Experimental results show that the intersection word alignment-based method consistently improves the performance for all four methods on both spoken and written language tasks.","This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a standard framework of confusion network based machine translation system combination. Section 3 introduces four word alignment methods, and the algorithm of computing intersection word alignment for all four word alignment methods. Section 4 describes the experiments setting and results on two translation tasks. Section 5 concludes the paper."]},{"title":"2 Confusion network based system combination","paragraphs":["In order to compare different hypothesis alignment methods, we implement a confusion network decoding system as follows:","Backbone selection: in the previous work, Matusov et al.

(2006, 2008) proposed using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to align words between the backbone and hypothesis. This method uses enhanced HMM model bootstrapped from IBM Model-1 to estimate the alignment model. All hypotheses of the whole test set are collected to create sentence pairs for GIZA++ training. GIZA++ produces hypothesis-backbone many-to-1 word alignments.","TER-based: TER-based word alignment method (Sim et al., 2007; Rosti et al., 2007a; Rosti et al., 2007b) is an extension of multiple string matching algorithm based on Levenshtein edit distance (Bangalore et al., 2001). The TER (translation error rate) score (Snover et al., 2006) measures the ratio of minimum number of string edits between a hypothesis and reference where the edits include insertions, deletions, substitu-tions and phrase shifts. The hypothesis is modified to match the reference, where a greedy search is used to select the set of shifts because an optimal sequence of edits (with shifts) is very expensive to find. The best alignment is the one that gives the minimum number of translation edits. TER-based method produces 1-to-1 word alignments.","CLA-based: Chen et al. (2008) used competitive linking algorithm (CLA) (Melamed, 2000) to build confusion network for hypothesis regeneration. Firstly, an association score is computed for every possible word pair from the backbone and hypothesis to be aligned. Then a greedy algorithm is applied to select the best word alignment. We compute the association score from a linear combination of two clues: 943 surface similarity computed as Equation (2) and position difference based distortion score by following (He et al., 2008). CLA works under a 1-to-1 assumption, so it produces 1-to-1 word alignments.","IHMM-based: He et al. (2008) propose an indirect hidden Markov model (IHMM) for hypothesis alignment. Different from traditional HMM, this model estimates the parameters indirectly from various sources, such as word semantic similarity, surface similarity and distortion penalty, etc. For fair comparison reason, we also use the surface similarity computed as Equation (2) and position difference based distortion score which are used for CLA-based word alignment. IHMM-based method produces many-to-1 word alignments.","3.2 Intersection word alignment and its expansion In previous work, Matusov et al. (2006, 2008) used both direction word alignments to compute so-called state occupation probabilities and then compute the final word alignment. The other work usually used only one direction word alignment (many/1-to-1 from hypothesis to backbone). In this paper, we use more reliable word alignments which are derived from the intersection of both direct (hypothesis-to-backbone) and inverse (backbone-to-hypothesis) word alignments with heuristic-based expansion which is widely used in bilingual word alignment. The algorithm includes two steps:","1) Generate bi-directional word alignments. It is straightforward for GIZA++ and IHMM to generate bi-directional word alignments. This is simply achieved by switching the parameters of source and target sentences. Due to the nature of greedy search in TER, the bi-directional TER-based word alignments by switching the parameters of source and target sentences are not necessary exactly the same. For example, in Figure 2, the word “shot” can be aligned to either “shoot” or “the” as the edit cost of word pair (shot, shoot) and (shot, the) are the same when compute the minimum-edit-distance for TER score.","  I shot killer I shoot the killer","a  I shoot the killer I shot killer","b","Figure 2: Example of two directions TER-based word alignments.
