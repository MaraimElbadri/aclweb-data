Asian languages such as Chinese and Japanese have no explicit word boundaries, thus word segmentation is a crucial rst step when processing them. Even in western languages, valid words are often not identical to space-separated tokens. For example, proper nouns such as United Kingdom or idiomatic phrases such as with respect to actually function as a single word, and we often condense them into the virtual words UK and w.r.t..","In order to extract words from text streams, unsupervised word segmentation is an important research area because the criteria for creating supervised training data could be arbitrary, and will be suboptimal for applications that rely on segmentations. It is particularly difcult to create correct training data for speech transcripts, colloquial texts, and classics where segmentations are often ambiguous, let alone is impossible for unknown languages whose properties computational linguists might seek to uncover.","From a scientic point of view, it is also interesting because it can shed light on how children learn words without the explicitly given boundaries for every word, which is assumed by supervised learning approaches.","Lately, model-based methods have been introduced for unsupervised segmentation, in particular those based on Dirichlet processes on words (Goldwater et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2008). This maximizes the probability of word segmentation w given a string s :","ŵ = argmax w p(wjs) . (1) This approach often implicitly includes heuristic criteria proposed so far1",", while having a clear statistical semantics to nd the most probable word segmentation that will maximize the probability of the data, here the strings.","However, they are still na¤ve with respect to word spellings, and the inference is very slow ow-ing to inefcient Gibbs sampling. Crucially, since they rely on sampling a word boundary between two neighboring words, they can leverage only up to bigram word dependencies.","In this paper, we extend this work to propose a more efcient and accurate unsupervised word segmentation that will optimize the performance of the word n-gram Pitman-Yor (i.e. Bayesian Kneser-Ney) language model, with an accurate character 1-gram Pitman-Yor spelling model embedded in word models. Further-more, it can be viewed as a method for building a high-performance n-gram language model directly from character strings of arbitrary language. It is carefully smoothed and has no unknown words problem, resulting from its model structure. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, 1 For instance, TANGO algorithm (Ando and Lee, 2003)","essentially nds segments such that character n-gram proba-","bilities are maximized blockwise, averaged over n. 100 (a) Generating n-gram distributions G hierarchically from the Pitman-Yor process.

Figure 1: Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Language Model. we briey describe a language model based on the Pitman-Yor process (Teh, 2006b), which is a generalization of the Dirichlet process used in previous research. By embedding a character n-gram in word n-gram from a Bayesian perspective, Section 3 introduces a novel language model for word segmentation, which we call the Nested Pitman-Yor language model. Section 4 describes an efcient blocked Gibbs sampler that leverages dynamic programming for inference. In Section 5 we describe experiments on the standard datasets in Chinese and Japanese in addition to English phonetic transcripts, and semi-supervised experiments are also explored. Section 6 is a discussion and Section 7 concludes the paper."]},{"title":"2 Pitman-Yor process and n-gram models","paragraphs":["To compute a probability p(wjs) in (1), we adopt a Bayesian language model lately proposed by (Teh, 2006b; Goldwater et al., 2005) based on the Pitman-Yor process, a generalization of the Dirichlet process. As we shall see, this is a Bayesian theory of the best-performing Kneser-Ney smoothing of n-grams (Kneser and Ney, 1995), allowing an integrated modeling from a Bayesian perspective as persued in this paper.","The Pitman-Yor (PY) process is a stochastic process that generates discrete probability distribution G that is similar to another distribution G0, called a base measure. It is written as G PY(G0, d, θ) , (2) where d is a discount factor and θ controls how similar G is to G0 on average.","Suppose we have a unigram word distribution G1 = f p( ) g where ranges over each word in the lexicon. The bigram distribution G2 = f p(j v) g given a word v is different from G1, but will be similar to G1 especially for high frequency words. Therefore, we can generate G2 from a PY process of base measure G1, as G2 PY(G1, d, θ). Similarly, trigram distribution G3 = f p(j v′","v) g given an additional word v′","is generated as G","3 PY(G2, d, θ), and G1, G2, G3 will form a tree structure shown in Figure 1(a).","In practice, we cannot observe G directly because it will be innite dimensional distribution over the possible words, as we shall see in this paper. However, when we integrate out G it is known that Figure 1(a) can be represented by an equivalent hierarchical Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) (Aldous, 1985) as in Figure 1(b).","In this representation, each n-gram context h (including the null context ε for unigrams) is a Chinese restaurant whose customers are the n-gram counts c(wjh) seated over the tables 1 thw. The seatings has been incrementally constructed by choosing the table k for each count in c(wjh) with probability proportional to","{ chwk d (k = 1, , thw) θ + d th· (k = new ) , (3) where chwk is the number of customers seated at table k thus far and th· =","∑","w thw is the total number of tables in h. When k = new is selected, thw is incremented, and this means that the count was actually generated from the shorter context h′",". Therefore, in that case a proxy customer is sent to the parent restaurant and this process will recurse.","For example, if we have a sentence she will sing in the training data for trigrams, we add each word she will sing $ as a customer to its two preceding words context node, as described in Figure 1(b). Here, $ is a special token representing a sentence boundary in language model-101 ing (Brown et al., 1992).","As a result, the n-gram probability of this hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model (HPYLM) is recursively computed as p(wjh) =","c(wjh) d thw θ+c(h) + θ+d th· θ+c(h)","p(wjh′ ),","(4)","where p(wjh′ ) is the same probability using a","(n 1)-gram context h′",". When we set t","hw 1, (4) recovers a Kneser-Ney smoothing: thus a HPYLM is a Bayesian Kneser-Ney language model as well as an extension of the hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) used in Goldwater et al. (2006). θ, d are hyperparameters that can be learned as Gamma and Beta posteriors, respectively, given the data. For details, see Teh (2006a).","The inference of this model interleaves adding and removing a customer to optimize thw, d, and θ using MCMC. However, in our case words are not known a priori: the next section describes how to accomplish this by constructing a nested HPYLM of words and characters, with the associated inference algorithm."]},{"title":"3 Nested Pitman-Yor Language Model","paragraphs":["Thus far we have assumed that the unigram G1 is already given, but of course it should also be generated as G1 PY(G0, d, θ).","Here, a problem occurs: What should we use for G0, namely the prior probabilities over words2","? If a lexicon is nite, we can use a uniform prior G0(w) = 1/jV j for every word w in lexicon V . However, with word segmentation every substring could be a word, thus the lexicon is not limited but will be countably innite.","Building an accurate G0 is crucial for word segmentation, since it determines how the possible words will look like. Previous work using a Dirichlet process used a relatively simple prior for G0, namely an uniform distribution over characters (Goldwater et al., 2006), or a prior solely dependent on word length with a Poisson distribution whose parameter is xed by hand (Xu et al., 2008).","In contrast, in this paper we use a simple but more elaborate model, that is, a character n-gram language model that also employs HPYLM. This is important because in English, for example, words are likely to end in ‘tion’ and begin with 2 Note that this is different from unigrams, which are pos-","terior distribution given data. Figure 2: Chinese restaurant representation of our Nested Pitman-Yor Language Model (NPYLM). ‘re’, but almost never end in ‘tio’ nor begin with ‘sre’ 3",". Therefore, we use G0(w) = p(c1 ck) (5) = k ∏ i=1 p(cijc1 ci−1) (6) where string c1 ck is a spelling of w, and p(cijc1 ci−1) is given by the character HPYLM according to (4).","This language model, which we call Nested Pitman-Yor Language Model (NPYLM) hereafter, is the hierarchical language model shown in Figure 2, where the character HPYLM is embedded as a base measure of the word HPYLM.4","As the nal base measure for the character HPYLM, we used a uniform prior over the possible characters of a given language. To avoid dependency on n-gram order n, we actually used the 1-gram language model (Mochihashi and Sumita, 2007), a variable order HPYLM, for characters. However, for generality we hereafter state that we used the HPYLM. The theory remains the same for 1-grams, except sampling or marginalizing over n as needed.","Furthermore, we corrected (5) so that word length will have a Poisson distribution whose parameter can now be estimated for a given language and word type. We describe this in detail in Section 4.3. Chinese Restaurant Representation In our NPYLM, the word model and the character model are not separate but connected through a nested CRP. When a word w is generated from its parent at the unigram node, it means that w","3","Imagine we try to segment an English character string itisrecognizedasthe· · · .","4","Strictly speaking, this is not nested in the sense of a Nested Dirichlet process (Rodriguez et al., 2008) and could be called hierarchical HPYLM, which denotes another model for domain adaptation (Wood and Teh, 2008). 102 is drawn from the base measure, namely a character HPYLM. Then we divide w into characters c1 ck to yield a sentence of characters and feed this into the character HPYLM as data.","Conversely, when a table becomes empty, this means that the data associated with the table are no longer valid. Therefore we remove the corresponding customers from the character HPYLM using the inverse procedure of adding a customer in Section 2.","All these processes will be invoked when a string is segmented into words and customers are added to the leaves of the word HPYLM. To segment a string into words, we used efcient dynamic programming combined with MCMC, as described in the next section."]},{"title":"4 Inference","paragraphs":["To nd the hidden word segmentation w of a string s = c1 cN , which is equivalent to the vector of binary hidden variables z = z1 zN , the simplest approach is to build a Gibbs sampler that randomly selects a character ci and draw a binary decision zi as to whether there is a word boundary, and then update the language model according to the new segmentation (Goldwater et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2008). When we iterate this procedure sufciently long, it becomes a sample from the true distribution (1) (Gilks et al., 1996).","However, this sampler is too inefcient since time series data such as word segmentation have a very high correlation between neighboring words. As a result, the sampler is extremely slow to converge. In fact, (Goldwater et al., 2006) reports that the sampler would not mix without annealing, and the experiments needed 20,000 times of sampling for every character in the training data.","Furthermore, it has an inherent limitation that it cannot deal with larger than bigrams, because it uses only local statistics between directly contiguous words for word segmentation. 4.1 Blocked Gibbs sampler Instead, we propose a sentence-wise Gibbs sampler of word segmentation using efcient dynamic programming, as shown in Figure 3.","In this algorithm, rst we randomly select a string, and then remove the sentence data of its word segmentation from the NPYLM.

When we repeat this process, it is expected to mix rapidly because it implicitly considers all possible segmentations of the given string at the same time.","This is called a blocked Gibbs sampler that samples z block-wise for each sentence. It has an additional advantage in that we can accommodate higher-order relationships than bigrams, particularly trigrams, for word segmentation. 5 4.2 Forward-Backward inference Then, how can we sample a segmentation w for each string s? In accordance with the Forward ltering Backward sampling of HMM (Scott, 2002), this is achieved by essentially the same algorithm employed to sample a PCFG parse tree within MCMC (Johnson et al., 2007) and grammar-based segmentation (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009). Forward Filtering. For this purpose, we maintain a forward variable α[t][k] in the bigram case. α[t][k] is the probability of a string c1 ct with the nal k characters being a word (see Figure 4). Segmentations before the nal k characters are marginalized using the following recursive relationship: α[t][k] = t−k ∑ j=1","p(ct t−k+1jct−k","t−k−j+1) α[t k][j] (7) where α[0][0] = 1 and we wrote cn cm as cm","n .6 The rationale for (7) is as follows.

For this purpose, Particle MCMC (Doucet et al., 2009) is promising but less efcient in a preliminary experiment.","6","As Murphy (2002) noted, in semi-HMM we cannot use a standard trick to avoid underow by normalizing α[t][k] into p(k|t), since the model is asynchronous. Instead we always compute (7) using logsumexp(). 103 Figure 4: Forward ltering of α[t][k] to marginal-ize out possible segmentations j before t k. 1: for t = 1 to N do 2: for k = max(1, t L) to t do 3: Compute α[t][k] according to (7). 4: end for 5: end for 6: Initialize t N , i 0, w0 $ 7: while t > 0 do 8: Draw k / p(wijct","t−k+1, Θ) α[t][k] 9: Set wi ct","t−k+1 10: Set t t k, i i + 1 11: end while 12: Return w = wi, wi−1, , w1.

Backward Sampling. Once the probability table α[t][k] is obtained, we can sample a word segmentation backwards. Since α[N ][k] is a marginal probability of string cN","1 with the last k characters being a word, and there is always a sentence boundary token $ at the end of the string, with probability proportional to p($jcN","N−k) α[N ][k] we can sample k to choose the boundary of the nal word. The second nal word is similarly sampled using the probability of preceding the last word just sampled: we continue this process until we arrive at the beginning of the string (Figure 5). Trigram case. For simplicity, we showed the algorithm for bigrams above. For trigrams, we maintain a forward variable α[t][k][j], which represents a marginal probability of string c1 ct with both the nal k characters and further j characters preceding it being words. Forward-Backward algorithm becomes complicated thus omitted, but can be derived following the extended algorithm for second order HMM (He, 1988). Complexity This algorithm has a complexity of O(N L2",") for bigrams and O(N L3",") for trigrams for each sentence, where N is the length of the sentence and L is the maximum allowed length of a word ( N ). 4.3 Poisson correction As Nagata (1996) noted, when only (5) is used in-adequately low probabilities are assigned to long words, because it has a largely exponential distribution over length. To correct this, we assume that word length k has a Poisson distribution with a mean λ:","Po(kjλ) = e−λ λk k! . (13)","Since the appearance of c1 ck is equivalent to that of length k and the content, by making the character n-gram model explicit as Θ we can set p(c1 ck) = p(c1 ck, k) (14) =","p(c1 ck, kjΘ) p(kjΘ) Po(kjλ) (15) where p(c1 ck, kjΘ) is an n-gram probability given by (6), and p(kjΘ) is a probability that a word of length k will be generated from Θ. While previous work used p(kjΘ) = (1 p($))k−1","p($), this is only true for unigrams. Instead, we employed a Monte Carlo method that generates words randomly from Θ to obtain the empirical estimates of p(kjΘ). Estimating λ. Of course, we do not leave λ as a constant. Instead, we put a Gamma distribution p(λ) = Ga(a, b) = ba Γ(a)","λa−1 e−bλ","(16) to estimate λ from the data for given language and word type.7","Here, Γ(x) is a Gamma function and a, b are the hyperparameters chosen to give a nearly uniform prior distribution.8 7 We used different λ for different word types, such as dig-","its, alphabets, hiragana, CJK characters, and their mixtures.","W is a set of words of each such type, and (13) becomes a","mixture of Poisson distributions in this case. 8 In the following experiments, we set a = 0.2, b = 0.1. 104","Denoting W as a set of words obtained from word segmentation, the posterior distribution of λ used for (13) is p(λjW ) / p(W jλ)p(λ) = Ga ( a+ ∑ w∈W t(w)jwj, b+ ∑ w∈W t(w) ) , (17) where t(w) is the number of times word w is generated from the character HPYLM, i.e. the number of tables tεw for w in word unigrams. We sampled λ from this posterior for each Gibbs iteration."]},{"title":"5 Experiments","paragraphs":["To validate our model, we conducted experiments on standard datasets for Chinese and Japanese word segmentation that are publicly available, as well as the same dataset used in (Goldwater et al., 2006). Note that NPYLM maximizes the probability of strings, equivalently, minimizes the perplexity per character. Therefore, the recovery of the ground truth that is not available for inference is a byproduct in unsupervised learning.","Since our implementation is based on Unicode and learns all hyperparameters from the data, we also conrmed that NPYLM segments the Arabic Gigawords equally well. 5.1 English phonetic transcripts In order to directly compare with the previously reported result, we rst used the same dataset as Goldwater et al. (2006). This dataset consists of 9,790 English phonetic transcripts from CHILDES data (MacWhinney and Snow, 1985).","Since our algorithm converges rather fast, we ran the Gibbs sampler of trigram NPYLM for 200 iterations to obtain the results in Table 1. Among the token precision (P), recall (R), and F-measure (F), the recall is especially higher to outperform the previous result based on HDP in F-measure. Meanwhile, the same measures over the obtained lexicon (LP, LR, LF) are not always improved. Moreover, the average length of words inferred was surprisingly similar to ground truth: 2.88, while the ground truth is 2.87.","Table 2 shows the empirical computational time needed to obtain these results. Although the convergence in MCMC is not uniquely identied, improvement in efciency is also outstanding. 5.2 Chinese and Japanese word segmentation To show applicability beyond small phonetic transcripts, we used standard datasets for Chinese and Model P R F LP LR LF NPY(3) 74.8 75.2 75.0 47.8 59.7 53.1 NPY(2) 74.8 76.7 75.7 57.3 56.6 57.0 HDP(2) 75.2 69.6 72.3 63.5 55.2 59.1 Table 1: Segmentation accuracies on English phonetic transcripts.

Actually, NPYLM approximately converged around 50 iterations, 4 minutes. Japanese word segmentation, with all supervised segmentations removed in advance. Chinese For Chinese, we used a publicly available SIGHAN Bakeoff 2005 dataset (Emerson, 2005). To compare with the latest unsupervised results (using a closed dataset of Bakeoff 2006), we chose the common sets prepared by Microsoft Research Asia (MSR) for simplied Chinese, and by City University of Hong Kong (CITYU) for traditional Chinese. We used a random subset of 50,000 sentences from each dataset for training, and the evaluation was conducted on the enclosed test data. 9 Japanese For Japanese, we used the Kyoto Corpus (Kyoto) (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998): we used random subset of 1,000 sentences for evaluation and the remaining 37,400 sentences for training. In all cases we removed all whitespaces to yield raw character strings for inference, and set L = 4 for Chinese and L = 8 for Japanese to run the Gibbs sampler for 400 iterations.","The results (in token F-measures) are shown in Table 3. Our NPYLM signicantly ourperforms the best results using a heuristic approach reported in Zhao and Kit (2008). While Japanese accuracies appear lower, subjective qualities are much higher. This is mostly because NPYLM segments inectional sufxes and combines frequent proper names, which are inconsistent with the correct","9","Notice that analyzing a test data is not easy for character-wise Gibbs sampler of previous work.

In fact, although the difference in perplexity per character is not so large, the perplexity per word is radically reduced: 439.8 (bigram) to 190.1 (trigram). This is because trigram models can leverage complex dependencies over words to yield shorter words, resulting in better predictions and increased tokens.","Furthermore, NPYLM is easily amenable to semi-supervised or even supervised learning. In that case, we have only to replace the word segmentation w(s) in Figure 3 to the supervised one, for all or part of the training data. Table 4 shows the results using 10,000 sentences (1/5) or complete supervision. Our completely generative model achieves the performance of 94% (Chinese) or even 97% (Japanese) in supervised case. The result also shows that the supervised segmentations are suboptimal with respect to the perplexity per character, and even worse than unsupervised results. In semi-supervised case, using only 10K reference segmentations gives a performance of around 90% accuracy and the lowest perplexity, thanks to a combination with unsupervised data in a principled fashion. 5.3 Classics and English text Our model is particularly effective for spoken transcripts, colloquial texts, classics, or unknown languages where supervised segmentation data is difcult or even impossible to create.

This is because our model contains both word and character models that are combined and carefully smoothed, from a Bayesian perspective."]},{"title":"6 Discussion","paragraphs":["In retrospect, our NPYLM is essentially a hierarchical Markov model where the units (=words) evolve as the Markov process, and each unit has subunits (=characters) that also evolve as the Markov process. Therefore, for such languages as English that have already space-separated tokens, we can also begin with tokens besides the character-based approach in Section 5.3. In this case, each token is a character whose code is the integer token type, and a sentence is a sequence of characters. Figure 8 shows a part of the result computed over 100K sentences from Penn Treebank. We can see that some frequent phrases are identied as words, using a fully unsupervised approach. Notice that this is only attainable with NPYLM where each phrase is described as a n-gram model on its own, here a word 1-gram language model.","While we developed an efcient forward-backward algorithm for unsupervised segmentation, it is reminiscent of CRF in the discriminative approach. Therefore, it is also interesting to combine them in a discriminative way as persued in POS tagging using CRF+HMM (Suzuki et al., 2007), let alone a simple semi-supervised approach in Section 5.2.
