We propose to model term weighting into a sentiment analysis system utilizing collection statistics, contextual and topic-related characteristics as well as opinion-related properties. Experiments carried out on various datasets show that our approach effectively improves previous methods."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["With the explosion in the amount of commentaries on current issues and personal views expressed in weblogs on the Internet, the field of studying how to analyze such remarks and sentiments has been increasing as well. The field of opinion mining and sentiment analysis involves extracting opinionated pieces of text, determining the polarities and strengths, and extracting holders and targets of the opinions.","Much research has focused on creating testbeds for sentiment analysis tasks. Most notable and widely used are Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA) and Movie-review datasets. MPQA is a collection of newspaper articles annotated with opinions and private states at the subsentence level (Wiebe et al., 2003). Movie-review dataset consists of positive and negative reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) archive (Pang et al., 2002).","Evaluation workshops such as TREC and NTCIR have recently joined in this new trend of research and organized a number of successful meetings. At the TREC Blog Track meetings, researchers have dealt with the problem of retrieving topically-relevant blog posts and identifying documents with opinionated contents (Ounis et al., 2008). NTCIR Multilingual Opinion Analysis Task (MOAT) shared a similar mission, where participants are provided with a number of topics and a set of relevant newspaper articles for each topic, and asked to extract opinion-related properties from enclosed sentences (Seki et al., 2008).","Previous studies for sentiment analysis belong to either the data-driven approach where an annotated corpus is used to train a machine learning (ML) classifier, or to the lexicon-based approach where a pre-compiled list of sentiment terms is utilized to build a sentiment score function.","This paper introduces an approach to the sentiment analysis tasks with an emphasis on how to represent and evaluate the weights of sentiment terms. We propose a number of characteristics of good sentiment terms from the perspectives of in-formativeness, prominence, topic–relevance, and semantic aspects using collection statistics, contextual information, semantic associations as well as opinion–related properties of terms. These term weighting features constitute the sentiment analysis model in our opinion retrieval system. We test our opinion retrieval system with TREC and NTCIR datasets to validate the effectiveness of our term weighting features. We also verify the effectiveness of the statistical features used in data-driven approaches by evaluating an ML classifier with labeled corpora."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Representing text with salient features is an important part of a text processing task, and there exists many works that explore various features for 253 text analysis systems (Sebastiani, 2002; Forman, 2003). Sentiment analysis task have also been using various lexical, syntactic, and statistical features (Pang and Lee, 2008). Pang et al. (2002) employed n-gram and POS features for ML methods to classify movie-review data. Also, syntactic features such as the dependency relationship of words and subtrees have been shown to effectively improve the performances of sentiment analysis (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004; Gamon, 2004; Matsumoto et al., 2005; Ng et al., 2006).","While these features are usually employed by data-driven approaches, there are unsupervised approaches for sentiment analysis that make use of a set of terms that are semantically oriented toward expressing subjective statements (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003). Accordingly, much research has focused on recognizing terms’ semantic orientations and strength, and compiling sentiment lexicons (Hatzivassiloglou and Mckeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2003; Kamps et al., 2004; Whitelaw et al., 2005; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006).","Interestingly, there are conflicting conclusions about the usefulness of the statistical features in sentiment analysis tasks (Pang and Lee, 2008). Pang et al. (2002) presents empirical results indicating that using term presence over term frequency is more effective in a data-driven sentiment classification task. Such a finding suggests that sentiment analysis may exploit different types of characteristics from the topical tasks, that, unlike fact-based text analysis tasks, repetition of terms does not imply a significance on the overall sentiment. On the other hand, Wiebe et al. (2004) have noted that hapax legomena (terms that only appear once in a collection of texts) are good signs for detecting subjectivity. Other works have also exploited rarely occurring terms for sentiment analysis tasks (Dave et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2006).","The opinion retrieval task is a relatively recent issue that draws both the attention of IR and NLP communities. Its task is to find relevant documents that also contain sentiments about a given topic. Generally, the opinion retrieval task has been approached as a two–stage task: first, retrieving topically relevant documents, then reranking the documents by the opinion scores (Ounis et al., 2006). This approach is also appropriate for evaluation systems such as NTCIR MOAT that assumes that the set of topically relevant documents are already known in advance. On the other hand, there are also some interesting works on modeling the topic and sentiment of documents in a unified way (Mei et al., 2007; Zhang and Ye, 2008)."]},{"title":"3 Term Weighting and Sentiment Analysis","paragraphs":["In this section, we describe the characteristics of terms that are useful in sentiment analysis, and present our sentiment analysis model as part of an opinion retrieval system and an ML sentiment classifier. 3.1 Characteristics of Good Sentiment Terms This section examines the qualities of useful terms for sentiment analysis tasks and corresponding features. For the sake of organization, we categorize the sources of features into either global or local knowledge, and either topic-independent or topic-dependent knowledge.","Topic-independently speaking, a good sentiment term is discriminative and prominent, such that the appearance of the term imposes greater influence on the judgment of the analysis system. The rare occurrence of terms in document collections has been regarded as a very important feature in IR methods, and effective IR models of today, either explicitly or implicitly, accommodate this feature as an Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) heuristic (Fang et al., 2004). Similarly, prominence of a term is recognized by the frequency of the term in its local context, formulated as Term Frequency (TF) in IR.","If a topic of the text is known, terms that are relevant and descriptive of the subject should be regarded to be more useful than topically-irrelevant and extraneous terms. One way of measuring this is using associations between the query and terms. Statistical measures of associations between terms include estimations by the co-occurrence in the whole collection, such as Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). Another method is to use proximal information of the query and the word, using syntactic structure such as dependency relations of words that provide the graphical representation of the text (Mullen and Collier, 2004). The minimum spans of words in such graph may represent their associations in the text. Also, the distance between words in the local context or in the thesauruslike dictionaries such as WordNet may be approximated as such measure. 254 3.2 Opinion Retrieval Model The goal of an opinion retrieval system is to find a set of opinionated documents that are relevant to a given topic. We decompose the opinion retrieval system into two tasks: the topical retrieval task and the sentiment analysis task. This two-stage approach for opinion retrieval has been taken by many systems and has been shown to perform well (Ounis et al., 2006). The topic and the sentiment aspects of the opinion retrieval task are modeled separately, and linearly combined together to produce a list of topically-relevant and opinionated documents as below. ScoreOpRet(D, Q) = λ·Scorerel(D, Q)+(1−λ)·Scoreop(D, Q) The topic-relevance model Scorerel may be substituted by any IR system that retrieves relevant documents for the query Q. For tasks such as NTCIR MOAT, relevant documents are already known in advance and it becomes unnecessary to estimate the relevance degree of the documents. We focus on modeling the sentiment aspect of the opinion retrieval task, assuming that the topic-relevance of documents is provided in some way.","To assign documents with sentiment degrees, we estimate the probability of a document D to generate a query Q and to possess opinions as in-dicated by a random variable Op.1","Assuming uniform prior probabilities of documents D, query Q, and Op, and conditional independence between Q and Op, the opinion score function reduces to estimating the generative probability of Q and Op given D.","Scoreop(D, Q) ≡ p(D | Op, Q) ∝ p(Op, Q | D) If we regard that the document D is represented as a bag of words and that the words are uniformly distributed, then p(Op, Q | D) = X w∈D p(Op, Q | w) · p(w | D) = X w∈D p(Op | w) · p(Q | w) · p(w | D) (1) Equation 1 consists of three factors: the probability of a word to be opinionated (P (Op|w)), the likelihood of a query given a word (P (Q|w)), and the probability of a document generating a word (P (w|D)). Intuitively speaking, the probability of a document embodying topically related opinion is estimated by accumulating the probabilities of all","1","Throughout this paper, Op indicates Op = 1. words from the document to have sentiment meanings and associations with the given query.","In the following sections, we assess the three factors of the sentiment models from the perspectives of term weighting. 3.2.1 Word Sentiment Model Modeling the sentiment of a word has been a popular approach in sentiment analysis. There are many publicly available lexicon resources. The size, format, specificity, and reliability differ in all these lexicons. For example, lexicon sizes range from a few hundred to several hundred thousand. Some lexicons assign real number scores to in-dicate sentiment orientations and strengths (i.e. probabilities of having positive and negative sentiments) (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) while other lexicons assign discrete classes (weak/strong, positive/negative) (Wilson et al., 2005). There are manually compiled lexicons (Stone et al., 1966) while some are created semi-automatically by expanding a set of seed terms (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006).","The goal of this paper is not to create or choose an appropriate sentiment lexicon, but rather it is to discover useful term features other than the sentiment properties. For this reason, one sentiment lexicon, namely SentiWordNet, is utilized throughout the whole experiment.","SentiWordNet is an automatically generated sentiment lexicon using a semi-supervised method (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). It consists of WordNet synsets, where each synset is assigned three probability scores that add up to 1: positive, negative, and objective.","These scores are assigned at sense level (synsets in WordNet), and we use the following equations to assess the sentiment scores at the word level.","p(P os | w) = max s∈synset(w) SW NPos(s)","p(Neg | w) = max s∈synset(w) SW NNeg(s) p(Op | w) = max (p(P os | w), p(Neg | w)) where synset(w) is the set of synsets of w and SW NP os(s), SW NNeg(s) are positive and negative scores of a synset in SentiWordNet. We assess the subjective score of a word as the maximum value of the positive and the negative scores, because a word has either a positive or a negative sentiment in a given context.","The word sentiment model can also make use of other types of sentiment lexicons. The sub-255 jectivity lexicon used in OpinionFinder2","is compiled from several manually and automatically built resources. Each word in the lexicon is tagged with the strength (strong/weak) and polarity (Positive/Negative/Neutral). The word sentiment can be modeled as below. P (P os|w) = 8 > < > : 1.0 if w is Positive and Strong 0.5 if w is Positive and Weak 0.0 otherwise P (Op | w) = max (p(P os | w), p(Neg | w)) 3.2.2 Topic Association Model If a topic is given in the sentiment analysis, terms that are closely associated with the topic should be assigned heavy weighting. For example, sentiment words such as scary and funny are more likely to be associated with topic words such as book and movie than grocery or refrigerator.","In the topic association model, p(Q | w) is estimated from the associations between the word w and a set of query terms Q. p(Q | w) = P","q∈Q Asc-Score(q, w) | Q | ∝ X q∈Q Asc-Score(q, w) Asc-Score(q, w) is the association score between q and w, and | Q | is the number of query words.","To measure associations between words, we employ statistical approaches using document collections such as LSA and PMI, and local proximity features using the distance in dependency trees or texts.","Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) creates a semantic space from a collection of documents to measure the semantic relatedness of words. Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) is a measure of associations used in information theory, where the association between two words is evaluated with the joint and individual distributions of the two words. PMI-IR (Turney, 2001) uses an IR system and its search operators to estimate the probabilities of two terms and their conditional probabilities. Equations for association scores using LSA and PMI are given below. Asc-ScoreLSA(w1, w2) =","1 + LSA(w1, w2) 2 Asc-ScorePMI(w1, w2) =","1 + P MI-IR(w1, w2) 2 2 http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa/ For the experimental purpose, we used publicly available online demonstrations for LSA and PMI. For LSA, we used the online demonstration mode from the Latent Semantic Analysis page from the University of Colorado at Boulder.3","For PMI, we used the online API provided by the CogWorks Lab at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.4","Word associations between two terms may also be evaluated in the local context where the terms appear together. One way of measuring the proximity of terms is using the syntactic structures. Given the dependency tree of the text, we model the association between two terms as below. Asc-ScoreDTP (w1, w2) = ( 1.0 min. span in dep. tree ≤ Dsyn 0.5 otherwise where, Dsyn is arbitrarily set to 3.","Another way is to use co-occurrence statistics as below. Asc-ScoreWP (w1, w2) = ( 1.0 if distance betweenw1andw2 ≤ K 0.5 otherwise where K is the maximum window size for the co-occurrence and is arbitrarily set to 3 in our experiments.","The statistical approaches may suffer from data sparseness problems especially for named entity terms used in the query, and the proximal clues cannot sufficiently cover all term–query associations. To avoid assigning zero probabilities, our topic association models assign 0.5 to word pairs with no association and 1.0 to words with perfect association.","Note that proximal features using co-occurrence and dependency relationships were used in previous work. For opinion retrieval tasks, Yang et al. (2006) and Zhang and Ye (2008) used the co-occurrence of a query word and a sentiment word within a certain window size. Mullen and Collier (2004) manually annotated named entities in their dataset (i.e. title of the record and name of the artist for music record reviews), and utilized presence and position features in their ML approach. 3.2.3 Word Generation Model Our word generation model p(w | d) evaluates the prominence and the discriminativeness of a word","3","http://lsa.colorado.edu/, default parameter settings for the semantic space (TASA, 1st year college level) and number of factors (300).","4","http://cwl-projects.cogsci.rpi.edu/msr/, PMI-IR with the Google Search Engine. 256 w in a document d. These issues correspond to the core issues of traditional IR tasks. IR models, such as Vector Space (VS), probabilistic models such as BM25, and Language Modeling (LM), albeit in different forms of approach and measure, employ heuristics and formal modeling approaches to effectively evaluate the relevance of a term to a document (Fang et al., 2004). Therefore, we estimate the word generation model with popular IR models’ the relevance scores of a document d given w as a query.5 p(w | d) ≡ IR-SCORE(w, d) In our experiments, we use the Vector Space model with Pivoted Normalization (VS), Probabilistic model (BM25), and Language modeling with Dirichlet Smoothing (LM).","V SPN(w, d) = 1 + ln(1 + ln(c(w, d))) (1 − s) + s · | d |","avgdl","· ln N + 1 df(w)","BM25(w, d) = ln N − df(w) + 0.5 df(w) + 0.5 · (k","1 + 1) · c(w, d) k 1 “","(1 − b) + b |d| avgdl ” + c(w, d) LMDI(w, d) = ln ","1 + c(w, d) μ · c(w, C) !","+ ln μ | d | +μ c(w, d) is the frequency of w in d, | d | is the number of unique terms in d, avgdl is the average | d | of all documents, N is the number of documents in the collection, df (w) is the number of documents with w, C is the entire collection, and k1 and b are constants 2.0 and 0.75. 3.3 Data-driven Approach To verify the effectiveness of our term weighting schemes in experimental settings of the data-driven approach, we carry out a set of simple experiments with ML classifiers. Specifically, we explore the statistical term weighting features of the word generation model with Support Vector machine (SVM), faithfully reproducing previous work as closely as possible (Pang et al., 2002).","Each instance of train and test data is represented as a vector of features. We test various combinations of the term weighting schemes listed below. • PRESENCE: binary indicator for the pres-","ence of a term • TF: term frequency 5 With proper assumptions and derivations, p(w | d) can","be derived to language modeling approaches.

PMI and LSA, both modeling the semantic associations between words, show different behaviors on the datasets. For the NTCIR dataset, LSA performed better, while PMI is more effective for the TREC dataset. We be-lieve that the explanation lies in the differences between the topics for each dataset. In general, the NTCIR topics are general descriptive words such as “regenerative medicine”, “American economy after the 911 terrorist attacks”, and “lawsuit brought against Microsoft for monopolistic practices.” The TREC topics are more named-entity-like terms such as “Carmax”, “Wikipedia primary source”, “Jiffy Lube”, “Starbucks”, and “Windows Vista.” We have experimentally shown that LSA is more suited to finding associations between general terms because its training documents are from a general domain.9","Our PMI measure utilizes a web search engine, which covers a variety of named entity terms.","Though the features of our topic association model, WP and DTP, were evaluated on different datasets, we try our best to conjecture the differences. WP on TREC dataset shows a small improvement of MAP compared to other topic association features, while the precision is improved the most when this feature is used alone. The DTP feature displays similar behavior with precision. It also achieves the best f-measure over other topic association features.
