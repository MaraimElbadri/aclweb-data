However, as the parsing accuracy usually goes down dramatically with the increase of sentence length, translating long sentences often takes long time and only produces degenerate translations. We propose a new method named sub-sentence division that reduces the decoding time and improves the translation quality for tree-based translation. Our approach divides long sentences into several sub-sentences by exploiting tree structures. Large-scale experiments on the NIST 2008 Chinese-to-English test set show that our approach achieves an absolute improvement of 1.1 BLEU points over the baseline system in 50% less time."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Tree-based statistical machine translation models in days have witness promising progress in recent years, such as tree-to-string models (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), tree-to-tree models (Quirk et al.,2005;Zhang et al., 2008). Especially, when incorporated with forest, the correspondent forest-based tree-to-string models (Mi et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2009), tree-to-tree models (Liu et al., 2009) have achieved a promising improvements over correspondent tree-based systems. However, when we translate long sentences, we argue that two major issues will be raised. On one hand, parsing accuracy will be lower as the length of sentence grows. It will in-evitably hurt the translation quality (Quirk and Corston-Oliver, 2006; Mi and Huang, 2008). On the other hand, decoding on long sentences will be time consuming, especially for forest approaches. So splitting long sentences into sub-  Figure 1. Main framework of our method  sentences becomes a natural way in MT literature.","A simple way is to split long sentences by punctuations. However, without concerning about the original whole tree structures, this approach will result in ill-formed sub-trees which don’t respect to original structures. In this paper, we present a new approach, which pays more attention to parse trees on the long sentences. We firstly parse the long sentences into trees, and then divide them accordingly into sub-sentences, which will be translated independently (Section 3). Finally, we combine sub translations into a full translation (Section 4). Large-scale experiments (Section 5) show that the BLEU score achieved by our approach is 1.1 higher than direct decoding and 0.3 higher than always splitting on commas on the 2008 NIST MT Chinese-English test set. Moreover, our approach has reduced decoding time significantly."]},{"title":"2 Framework","paragraphs":["Our approach works in following steps. (1) Split a long sentence into sub-sentences. (2) Translate all the sub-sentences respectively. (3) Combine the sub-translations.","Figure 1 illustrates the main idea of our approach. The crucial issues of our method are how to divide long sentences and how to combine the sub-translations."]},{"title":"3 Sub Sentence Division","paragraphs":["Long sentences could be very complicated in grammar and sentence structure, thereby creating an obstacle for translation. Consequently, we need to break them into shorter and easier clauses. To divide sentences by punctuation is 137   Figure 2. An undividable parse tree   Figure 3. A dividable parse tree  one of the most commonly used methods. However, simply applying this method might damage the accuracy of parsing. As a result, the strategy we proposed is to operate division while concerning the structure of parse tree.","As sentence division should not influence the accuracy of parsing, we have to be very cautious about sentences whose division might decrease the accuracy of parsing. Figure 2(a) shows an example of the parse tree of an undividable sentence.","As can be seen in Figure 2, when we divide the sentence by comma, it would break the structure of “VP” sub-tree and result in a ill-formed sub-tree “VP” (right sub-tree), which don’t have a subject and don’t respect to original tree structures.","Consequently, the key issue of sentence division is finding the sentences that can be divided without loosing parsing accuracy. Figure 2(b) shows the parse tree of a sentence that can be divided by punctuation, as sub-sentences divided by comma are independent. The reference translation of the sentence in figure 3 is","","Less than two hours earlier, a Palestinian took on a shooting spree on passengers in the town of Kfar Saba in northern Israel.","Pseudocode 1 Check Sub Sentence Divi-","sion Algorithm 1: procedure CheckSubSentence(sent) 2: for each word i in sent 3: if(i is a comma) 4: left={words in left side of i}; //words between last comma and cur-","rent comma i 5: right={words in right side of i}; //words between i and next comma or","semicolon, period, question mark 6: isDividePunct[i]=true; 7: for each j in left 8: if(( LCA(j, i)!=parent[i]) 9: isDividePunct[i]=false; 10: break; 11: for each j in right 12: if(( LCA(j, i)!=parent[i]) 13: isDividePunct[i]=false; 14: break; 15: function LCA(i, j) 16: return lowest common ancestor(i, j);  It demonstrates that this long sentence can be divided into two sub-sentences, providing a good support to our division. In addition to dividable sentences and non-dividable sentences, there are sentences containing more than one comma, some of which are dividable and some are not. However, this does not prove to be a problem, as we process each comma independently. In other words, we only split the dividable part of this kind of sentences, leaving the non-dividable part unchanged. To find the sentences that can be divided, we present a new method and provide its pseudo code. Firstly, we divide a sentence by its commas. For each word in the sub-sentence on the left side of a comma, we compute its lowest common ancestor (LCA) with the comma. And we process the words in the sub-sentence on the right side of the comma in the same way. Finally, we check if all the LCA we have computed are comma’s parent node. If all the LCA are the comma’s parent node, the sub-sentences are independent. As shown in figure 3, the LCA (AD 不到 , PU ,), is “IP” ,which is the parent node of “PU ,”; and the LCA (NR 以色列 , PU ,) is also “IP”. Till we have checked all the LCA of each word and comma, we finally find that all the LCA are “IP”. As a result, this sentence can be divided without loosing parsing accuracy. LCA can be computed by using union-set (Tarjan, 1971) in lineal time.
