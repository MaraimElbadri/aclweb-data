Previous efforts add syntactic constraints to phrase-based translation by directly rewarding/punishing a hypothesis whenever it matches/violates source-side constituents.

The model brackets a source phrase as to whether it satisfies the learnt syntactic constraints. The bracketed phrases are then translated as a whole unit by the decoder. Experimental results and analysis show that the new model outperforms other previous methods and achieves a substantial improvement over the baseline which is not syntactically informed."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The phrase-based approach is widely adopted in statistical machine translation (SMT). It segments a source sentence into a sequence of phrases, then translates and reorder these phrases in the target. In such a process, original phrase-based decoding (Koehn et al., 2003) does not take advantage of any linguistic analysis, which, however, is broadly used in rule-based approaches. Since it is not linguistically motivated, original phrase-based decoding might produce ungrammatical or even wrong translations. Consider the following Chinese fragment with its parse tree:","Src: [ [[7 11]NP [ [ [ ]NP ]PP ]VP ]IP ]VP Ref: established July 11 as Sailing Festival day","Output: [to/ [⟨[set up/ [for/ naviga-tion/]] on July 11/711⟩ knots/]] The output is generated from a phrase-based system which does not involve any syntactic analysis. Here we use “[]” (straight orientation) and “⟨⟩” (inverted orientation) to denote the common structure of the source fragment and its translation found by the decoder. We can observe that the decoder inadequately breaks up the second NP phrase and translates the two words “” and “” separately. However, the parse tree of the source fragment constrains the phrase “ ” to be translated as a unit.","Without considering syntactic constraints from the parse tree, the decoder makes wrong decisions not only on phrase movement but also on the lexical selection for the multi-meaning word “”1",". To avert such errors, the decoder can fully respect linguistic structures by only allowing syntactic constituent translations and reorderings. This, unfortunately, significantly jeopardizes performance (Koehn et al., 2003; Xiong et al., 2008) because by integrating syntactic constraint into decoding as a hard constraint, it simply prohibits any other useful non-syntactic translations which violate constituent boundaries.","To better leverage syntactic constraint yet still allow non-syntactic translations, Chiang (2005) introduces a count for each hypothesis and accumulates it whenever the hypothesis exactly matches syntactic boundaries on the source side. On the contrary, Marton and Resnik (2008) and Cherry (2008) accumulate a count whenever hypotheses violate constituent boundaries. These constituent matching/violation counts are used as a feature in the decoder’s log-linear model and their weights are tuned via minimal error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003). In this way, syntactic constraint is integrated into decoding as a soft constraint to enable the decoder to reward hypotheses that respect syntactic analyses or to pe-1 This word can be translated into “section”, “festival”,","and “knot” in different contexts. 315 nalize hypotheses that violate syntactic structures.","Although experiments show that this constituent matching/violation counting feature achieves significant improvements on various language-pairs, one issue is that matching syntactic analysis can not always guarantee a good translation, and violating syntactic structure does not always induce a bad translation. Marton and Resnik (2008) find that some constituency types favor matching the source parse while others encourage violations. Therefore it is necessary to integrate more syntactic constraints into phrase translation, not just the constraint of constituent matching/violation.","The other issue is that during decoding we are more concerned with the question of phrase cohesion, i.e. whether the current phrase can be translated as a unit or not within particular syntactic contexts (Fox, 2002)2",", than that of constituent matching/violation. Phrase cohesion is one of the main reasons that we introduce syntactic constraints (Cherry, 2008). If a source phrase remains contiguous after translation, we refer this type of phrase bracketable, otherwise unbracketable. It is more desirable to translate a bracketable phrase than an unbracketable one.","In this paper, we propose a syntax-driven bracketing (SDB) model to predict whether a phrase (a sequence of contiguous words) is bracketable or not using rich syntactic constraints. We parse the source language sentences in the word-aligned training corpus. According to the word alignments, we define bracketable and unbracketable instances. For each of these instances, we automatically extract relevant syntactic features from the source parse tree as bracketing evidences. Then we tune the weights of these features using a maximum entropy (ME) trainer. In this way, we build two bracketing models: 1) a unary SDB model (UniSDB) which predicts whether an independent phrase is bracketable or not; and 2) a binary SDB model(BiSDB) which predicts whether two neighboring phrases are bracketable. Similar to previous methods, our SDB model is integrated into the decoder’s log-linear model as a feature so that we can inherit the idea of soft constraints.","In contrast to the constituent matching/violation counting (CMVC) (Chiang, 2005; Marton and Resnik, 2008; Cherry, 2008), our SDB model has 2 Here we expand the definition of phrase to include both","syntactic and non-syntactic phrases. the following advantages","• The SDB model automatically learns syntactic constraints from training data while the CMVC uses manually defined syntactic constraints: constituency matching/violation. In our SDB model, each learned syntactic feature from bracketing instances can be considered as a syntactic constraint. Therefore we can use thousands of syntactic constraints to guide phrase translation.","• The SDB model maintains and protects the strength of the phrase-based approach in a better way than the CMVC does. It is able to reward non-syntactic translations by assign-ing an adequate probability to them if these translations are appropriate to particular syntactic contexts on the source side, rather than always punish them.","We test our SDB model against the baseline which doest not use any syntactic constraints on Chinese-to-English translation. To compare with the CMVC, we also conduct experiments using (Marton and Resnik, 2008)’s XP+. The XP+ accumulates a count for each hypothesis whenever it violates the boundaries of a constituent with a label from {NP, VP, CP, IP, PP, ADVP, QP, LCP, DNP}. The XP+ is the best feature among all features that Marton and Resnik use for Chinese-to-English translation. Our experimental results display that our SDB model achieves a substantial improvement over the baseline and significantly outperforms XP+ according to the BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002). In addition, our analysis shows further evidences of the performance gain from a different perspective than that of BLEU.","The paper proceeds as follows. In section 2 we describe how to learn bracketing instances from a training corpus. In section 3 we elaborate the syntax-driven bracketing model, including feature generation and the integration of the SDB model into phrase-based SMT. In section 4 and 5, we present our experiments and analysis. And we finally conclude in section 6."]},{"title":"2 The Acquisition of Bracketing Instances","paragraphs":["In this section, we formally define the bracketing instance, comprising two types namely binary bracketing instance and unary bracketing instance. 316 We present an algorithm to automatically extract these bracketing instances from word-aligned bilingual corpus where the source language sentences are parsed.","Let c and e be the source sentence and the target sentence, W be the word alignment between them, T be the parse tree of c. We define a binary bracketing instance as a tuple ⟨b, τ (ci..j), τ (cj+1..k), τ (ci..k)⟩ where b ∈ {bracketable, unbracketable}, ci..j and cj+1..k are two neighboring source phrases and τ (T, s) (τ (s) for short) is a subtree function which returns the minimal subtree covering the source sequence s from the source parse tree T . Note that τ (ci..k) includes both τ (ci..j) and τ (cj+1..k). For the two neighboring source phrases, the following conditions are satisfied: ∃eu..v, ep..q ∈ e s.t. ∀(m, n) ∈ W, i ≤ m ≤ j ↔ u ≤ n ≤ v (1) ∀(m, n) ∈ W, j + 1 ≤ m ≤ k ↔ p ≤ n ≤ q (2) The above (1) means that there exists a target phrase eu..v aligned to ci..j and (2) denotes a target phrase ep..q aligned to cj+1..k. If eu..v and ep..q are neighboring to each other or all words between the two phrases are aligned to null, we set b = bracketable, otherwise b = unbracketable. From a binary bracketing instance, we derive a unary bracketing instance ⟨b, τ (ci..k)⟩, ignoring the subtrees τ (ci..j) and τ (cj+1..k).","Let n be the number of words of c. If we extract all potential bracketing instances, there will be o(n2",") unary instances and o(n3",") binary instances. To keep the number of bracketing instances tractable, we only record 4 representative bracketing instances for each index j: 1) the bracketable instance with the minimal τ (ci..k), 2) the bracketable instance with the maximal τ (ci..k), 3) the unbracketable instance with the minimal τ (ci..k), and 4) the unbracketable instance with the maximal τ (ci..k).","Figure 1 shows the algorithm to extract bracketing instances.

The SDB model exploits various syntactic features as follows.","• Rule Features (RF) We use the CFG rules of σ(s), σ(s1) and σ(s2) as features. These features capture syntactic “horizontal context” which demonstrates the expansion trend of the source phrase s, s1 and s2 on the parse tree. In figure 2, the CFG rule “ADVP→AD”, “VP→VV AS NP”, and “VP→ADVP VP” are used as features for s1, s2 and s respectively.","• Path Features (PF) The tree path σ(s1)..σ(s) connecting σ(s1) and σ(s), σ(s2)..σ(s) connecting σ(s2) and σ(s), and σ(s)..ρ connecting σ(s) and the root node ρ of the whole parse tree are used as features. These features provide syntactic “vertical context” which shows the generation history of the source phrases on the parse tree.

The gray circles are constituent boundaries while the black circles are phrase boundaries. In figure 2, the path features are “ADVP VP”, “VP VP” and “VP IP” for s1, s2 and s respectively.","• Constituent Boundary Matching Features (CBMF) These features are to capture the relationship between a source phrase s and τ (s) or τ (s)’s subtrees. There are three different scenarios3",": 1) exact match, where s exactly matches the boundaries of τ (s) (figure 3(a)), 2) inside match, where s exactly spans a sequence of τ (s)’s subtrees (figure 3(b)), and 3) crossing, where s crosses the boundaries of one or two subtrees of τ (s) (figure 3(c)). In the case of 1) or 2), we set the value of this feature to σ(s)-M or σ(s)-I respectively. When s crosses the boundaries of the sub-constituent εl on s’s left, we set the value to σ(εl)-LC; If s crosses the boundaries of the sub-constituent εr on s’s right, we set the value to σ(εr)-RC; If both, we set the value to σ(εl)-LC-σ(εr)-RC. Let’s revisit the Figure 2. The source phrase s1 exactly matches the constituent ADVP, therefore CBMF is “ADVP-M”. The source phrase s2 exactly spans two sub-trees VV and AS of VP, therefore CBMF is “VP-I”. Finally, the source phrase s cross boundaries of the lower VP on the right, therefore CBMF is “VP-RC”.","3.3 The Integration of the SDB Model into Phrase-Based SMT We integrate the SDB model into phrase-based SMT to help decoder perform syntax-driven phrase translation. In particular, we add a 3 The three scenarios that we define here are similar to","those in (Lü et al., 2002). 318 new feature into the log-linear translation model: PSDB(b|T, τ (.)). This feature is computed by the SDB model described in equation (3) or equation (4), which estimates a probability that a source span is to be translated as a unit within particular syntactic contexts. If a source span can be translated as a unit, the feature will give a higher probability even though this span violates boundaries of a constituent. Otherwise, a lower probability is given. Through this additional feature, we want the decoder to prefer hypotheses that translate source spans which can be translated as a unit, and avoids translating those which are discontinuous after translation. The weight of this new feature is tuned via MERT, which measures the extent to which this feature should be trusted.","In this paper, we implement the SDB model in a state-of-the-art phrase-based system which adapts a binary bracketing transduction grammar (BTG) (Wu, 1997) to phrase translation and reordering, described in (Xiong et al., 2006). Whenever a BTG merging rule (s → [s1 s2] or s → ⟨s1 s2⟩) is used, the SDB model gives a probability to the span s covered by the rule, which estimates the extent to which the span is bracketable. For the unary SDB model, we only consider the features from τ (s). For the binary SDB model, we use all features from τ (s1), τ (s2) and τ (s) since the binary SDB model is naturally suitable to the binary BTG rules.","The SDB model, however, is not only limited to phrase-based SMT using BTG rules. Since it is applied on a source span each time, any other hierarchical phrase-based or syntax-based system that translates source spans recursively or linearly, can adopt the SDB model."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["We carried out the MT experiments on Chinese-to-English translation, using (Xiong et al., 2006)’s system as our baseline system. We modified the baseline decoder to incorporate our SDB models as descried in section 3.3. In order to compare with Marton and Resnik’s approach, we also adapted the baseline decoder to their XP+ feature. 4.1 Experimental Setup In order to obtain syntactic trees for SDB models and XP+, we parsed source sentences using a lexicalized PCFG parser (Xiong et al., 2005). The parser was trained on the Penn Chinese Treebank with an F1 score of 79.4%.","All translation models were trained on the FBIS corpus. We removed 15,250 sentences, for which the Chinese parser failed to produce syntactic parse trees. To obtain word-level alignments, we ran GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) on the remain-ing corpus in both directions, and applied the “grow-diag-final” refinement rule (Koehn et al., 2005) to produce the final many-to-many word alignments. We built our four-gram language model using Xinhua section of the English Gigaword corpus (181.1M words) with the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).","For the efficiency of MERT, we built our development set (580 sentences) using sentences not exceeding 50 characters from the NIST MT-02 set. We evaluated all models on the NIST MT-05 set using case-sensitive BLEU-4. Statistical significance in BLEU score differences was tested by paired bootstrap re-sampling (Koehn, 2004). 4.2 SDB Training We extracted 6.55M bracketing instances from our training corpus using the algorithm shown in figure 1, which contains 4.67M bracketable instances and 1.89M unbracketable instances. From extracted bracketing instances we generated syntax-driven features, which include 73,480 rule features, 153,614 path features and 336 constituent boundary matching features. To tune weights of features, we ran the MaxEnt toolkit (Zhang, 2004) with iteration number being set to 100 and Gaussian prior to 1 to avoid overfitting. 4.3 Results We ran the MERT module with our decoders to tune the feature weights. The values are shown in Table 1. The PSDB receives the largest feature weight, 0.29 for UniSDB and 0.38 for BiSDB, indicating that the SDB models exert a nontrivial impact on decoder.","In Table 2, we present our results. Like (Marton and Resnik, 2008), we find that the XP+ feature obtains a significant improvement of 1.08 BLEU over the baseline. However, using all syntax-driven features described in section 3.2, our SDB models achieve larger improvements of up to 1.67 BLEU. The binary SDB (BiSDB) model statistically significantly outperforms Marton and Resnik’s XP+ by an absolute improvement of 0.59 (relatively 2%).

Generally speaking, violations of long-span constituents have a more negative impact on performance than short-span violations if these violations are toxic. This explains why BiSDB achieves relatively higher precision improvements for higher n-grams over XP+, as shown in Table 3.","Second, compared with XP+ that only punishes constituent boundary violations, our SDB model is able to encourage violations if these violations are done on bracketable phrases.
