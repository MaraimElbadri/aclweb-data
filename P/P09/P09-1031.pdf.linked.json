It has been receiving increasing attention because semantic taxonomies, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), play an important role in solving knowledge-rich problems, including question answering (Harabagiu et al., 2003) and textual entailment (Geffet and Dagan, 2005). Nevertheless, most existing taxonomies are manually created at great cost. These taxonomies are rarely complete; it is difficult to include new terms in them from emerging or rapidly changing domains. Moreover, manual taxonomy construction is time-consuming, which may make it unfeasible for specialized domains and personalized tasks. Automatic taxonomy induction is a solution to augment existing resources and to produce new taxonomies for such domains and tasks.","Automatic taxonomy induction can be decomposed into two subtasks: term extraction and relation formation. Since term extraction is relatively easy, relation formation becomes the focus of most research on automatic taxonomy induction. In this paper, we also assume that terms in a taxonomy are given and concentrate on the subtask of relation formation.","Existing work on automatic taxonomy induction has been conducted under a variety of names, such as ontology learning, semantic class learning, semantic relation classification, and relation extraction. The approaches fall into two main categories: pattern-based and clustering-based. Pattern-based approaches define lexical-syntactic patterns for relations, and use these patterns to discover instances of relations. Clustering-based approaches hierarchically cluster terms based on similarities of their meanings usually represented by a vector of quantifiable features.","Pattern-based approaches are known for their high accuracy in recognizing instances of relations if the patterns are carefully chosen, either manually (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Kozareva et al., 2008) or via automatic bootstrapping (Hearst, 1992; Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Girju et al., 2003). The approaches, however, suffer from sparse coverage of patterns in a given corpus. Recent studies (Etzioni et al., 2005; Kozareva et al., 2008) show that if the size of a corpus, such as the Web, is nearly unlimited, a pattern has a higher chance to explicitly appear in the corpus. However, corpus size is often not that large; hence the problem still exists. Moreover, since patterns usually extract instances in pairs, the approaches suffer from the problem of inconsistent concept chains after connecting pairs of instances to form taxonomy hierarchies.","Clustering-based approaches have a main advantage that they are able to discover relations 271 which do not explicitly appear in text. They also avoid the problem of inconsistent chains by addressing the structure of a taxonomy globally from the outset. Nevertheless, it is generally be-lieved that clustering-based approaches cannot generate relations as accurate as pattern-based approaches. Moreover, their performance is largely influenced by the types of features used. The common types of features include contextual (Lin, 1998), co-occurrence (Yang and Callan, 2008), and syntactic dependency (Pantel and Lin, 2002; Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004). So far there is no systematic study on which features are the best for automatic taxonomy induction under various conditions.","This paper presents a metric-based taxonomy induction framework. It combines the strengths of both pattern-based and clustering-based approaches by incorporating lexico-syntactic patterns as one type of features in a clustering framework. The framework integrates contextual, co-occurrence, syntactic dependency, lexical-syntactic patterns, and other features to learn an ontology metric, a score indicating semantic distance, for each pair of terms in a taxonomy; it then incrementally clusters terms based on their ontology metric scores. The incremental clustering is transformed into an optimization problem based on two assumptions: minimum evolution and abstractness. The flexible design of the framework allows a further study of the interaction between features and relations, as well as that between features and term abstractness."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["There has been a substantial amount of research on automatic taxonomy induction. As we mentioned earlier, two main approaches are pattern-based and clustering-based.","Pattern-based approaches are the main trend for automatic taxonomy induction. Though suffering from the problems of sparse coverage and inconsistent chains, they are still popular due to their simplicity and high accuracy. They have been applied to extract various types of lexical and semantic relations, including is-a, part-of, sibling, synonym, causal, and many others.","Pattern-based approaches started from and still pay a great deal of attention to the most common is-a relations. Hearst (1992) pioneered using a hand crafted list of hyponym patterns as seeds and employing bootstrapping to discover is-a relations. Since then, many approaches (Mann, 2002; Etzioni et al., 2005; Snow et al., 2005) have used Hearst-style patterns in their work on is-a relations. For instance, Mann (2002) extracted is-a relations for proper nouns by Hearst-style patterns. Pantel et al. (2004) extended is-a relation acquisition towards terascale, and automatically identified hypernym patterns by minimal edit distance.","Another common relation is sibling, which describes the relation of sharing similar meanings and being members of the same class. Terms in sibling relations are also known as class members or similar terms. Inspired by the conjunction and appositive structures, Riloff and Shepherd (1997), Roark and Charniak (1998) used co-occurrence statistics in local context to discover sibling relations. The KnowItAll system (Etzioni et al., 2005) extended the work in (Hearst, 1992) and bootstrapped patterns on the Web to discover siblings; it also ranked and selected the patterns by statistical measures. Widdows and Dorow (2002) combined symmetric patterns and graph link analysis to discover sibling relations. Davidov and Rappoport (2006) also used symmetric patterns for this task. Recently, Kozareva et al. (2008) combined a double-anchored hyponym pattern with graph structure to extract siblings.","The third common relation is part-of. Berland and Charniak (1999) used two meronym patterns to discover part-of relations, and also used statistical measures to rank and select the matching instances. Girju et al. (2003) took a similar approach to Hearst (1992) for part-of relations.","Other types of relations that have been studied by pattern-based approaches include question-answer relations (such as birthdates and inventor) (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), synonyms and antonyms (Lin et al., 2003), general purpose analogy (Turney et al., 2003), verb relations (including similarity, strength, antonym, enablement and temporal) (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), entailment (Szpektor et al., 2004), and more specific relations, such as purpose, creation (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007), LivesIn, and EmployedBy (Bunescu and Mooney , 2007).","The most commonly used technique in pattern-based approaches is bootstrapping (Hearst, 1992; Etzioni et al., 2005; Girju et al., 2003; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006). It utilizes a few man-crafted seed patterns to extract instances from corpora, then extracts new patterns using these instances, and continues the cycle to find new instances and new patterns. It is effective and scalable to large datasets; however, uncontrolled bootstrapping 272 soon generates undesired instances once a noisy pattern brought into the cycle.","To aid bootstrapping, methods of pattern quality control are widely applied. Statistical measures, such as point-wise mutual information (Etzioni et al., 2005; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) and conditional probability (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007), have been shown to be effective to rank and select patterns and instances. Pattern quality control is also investigated by using WordNet (Girju et al., 2006), graph structures built among terms (Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Kozareva et al., 2008), and pattern clusters (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008).","Clustering-based approaches usually represent word contexts as vectors and cluster words based on similarities of the vectors (Brown et al., 1992; Lin, 1998). Besides contextual features, the vectors can also be represented by verb-noun relations (Pereira et al., 1993), syntactic dependency (Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004; Snow et al., 2005), co-occurrence (Yang and Callan, 2008), conjunction and appositive features (Caraballo, 1999). More work is described in (Buitelaar et al., 2005; Cimiano and Volker, 2005). Clustering-based approaches allow discovery of relations which do not explicitly appear in text. Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2006), however, pointed out that clustering-based approaches generally fail to produce coherent cluster for small corpora. In addition, clustering-based approaches had only applied to solve is-a and sibling relations.","Many clustering-based approaches face the challenge of appropriately labeling non-leaf clusters. The labeling amplifies the difficulty in creation and evaluation of taxonomies. Agglomerative clustering (Brown et al., 1992; Caraballo, 1999; Rosenfeld and Feldman, 2007; Yang and Callan, 2008) iteratively merges the most similar clusters into bigger clusters, which need to be labeled. Divisive clustering, such as CBC (Clustering By Committee) which constructs cluster centroids by averaging the feature vectors of a subset of carefully chosen cluster members (Pantel and Lin, 2002; Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004), also need to label the parents of split clusters. In this paper, we take an incremental clustering approach, in which terms and relations are added into a taxonomy one at a time, and their parents are from the existing taxonomy. The advantage of the incremental approach is that it eliminates the trouble of inventing cluster labels and concentrates on placing terms in the correct positions in a taxonomy hierarchy.","The work by Snow et al. (2006) is the most similar to ours because they also took an incremental approach to construct taxonomies. In their work, a taxonomy grows based on maximization of conditional probability of relations given evidence; while in our work based on optimization of taxonomy structures and modeling of term abstractness. Moreover, our approach employs heterogeneous features from a wide range; while their approach only used syntactic dependency. We compare system performance between (Snow et al., 2006) and our framework in Section 5."]},{"title":"3 The Features","paragraphs":["The features used in this work are indicators of semantic relations between terms. Given two input terms yx cc , , a feature is defined as a function generating a single numeric score","∈),( yx cch or a vector of numeric scores","∈),( yx cch n",". The features include contextual, co-occurrence, syntactic dependency, lexical-syntactic patterns, and miscellaneous.","The first set of features captures contextual information of terms. According to Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1954), words appearing in similar contexts tend to be similar. Therefore, word meanings can be inferred from and represented by contexts. Based on the hypothesis, we develop the following features: (1) Global Context KL-Divergence: The global context of each input term is the search results collected through querying search engines against several corpora (Details in Section 5.1). It is built into a unigram language model without smoothing for each term. This feature function measures the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence) between the language models associated with the two inputs. (2) Local Context KL-Divergence: The local context is the collection of all the left two and the right two words surrounding an input term. Similarly, the local context is built into a unigram language model without smoothing for each term; the feature function outputs KL divergence between the models.","The second set of features is co-occurrence. In our work, co-occurrence is measured by point-wise mutual information between two terms: )()( ),( log),( yx yx yx cCountcCount","ccCount ccpmi = where Count(.) is defined as the number of documents or sentences containing the term(s); or n as in “Results 1-10 of about n for term” appearing on the first page of Google search results for a term or the concatenation of a term pair. Based 273 on different definitions of Count(.), we have (3) Document PMI, (4) Sentence PMI, and (5) Google PMI as the co-occurrence features.","The third set of features employs syntactic dependency analysis. We have (6) Minipar Syntactic Distance to measure the average length of the shortest syntactic paths (in the first syntactic parse tree returned by Minipar 1",") between two terms in sentences containing them, (7) Modifier Overlap, (8) Object Overlap, (9) Subject Overlap, and (10) Verb Overlap to measure the number of overlaps between modifiers, objects, subjects, and verbs, respectively, for the two terms in sentences containing them. We use Assert2 to label the semantic roles.","The fourth set of features is lexical-syntactic patterns. We have (11) Hypernym Patterns based on patterns proposed by (Hearst, 1992) and (Snow et al., 2005), (12) Sibling Patterns which are basically conjunctions, and (13) Part-of Patterns based on patterns proposed by (Girju et al., 2003) and (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007). Table 1 lists all patterns. Each feature function returns a vector of scores for two input terms, one score per pattern. A score is 1 if two terms match a pattern in text, 0 otherwise.","The last set of features is miscellaneous. We have (14) Word Length Difference to measure the length difference between two terms, and (15) Definition Overlap to measure the number of word overlaps between the term definitions obtained by querying Google with “define:term”.","These heterogeneous features vary from simple statistics to complicated syntactic dependency features, basic word length to comprehensive Web-based contextual features. The flexible design of our learning framework allows us to use all of them, and even allows us to use different sets of them under different conditions, for in-stance, different types of relations and different abstraction levels.

T can be written as T(C,R). Note that for the subtask of relation formation, we assume that the term set C is given. A full taxonomy is a tree containing all the terms in C.

Concrete concepts often represent physical entities, such as “basketball” and “mercury pollution”. While abstract concepts, such as “science” and “economy”, do not have a physical form thus we must imagine their existence. This obvious difference suggests that there is a need to treat them differently in taxonomy induction. Hence we assume that terms at the same abstraction level have common characteristics and share the same Info(.) function.

In this work, the estimation and prediction of ontology metric are achieved by ridge regression (Hastie et al., 2001). In the training data, an ontology metric d(cx,cy) for a term pair (cx,cy) is generated by assuming every edge weight as 1 and summing up all the edge weights along the shortest path from cx to cy.

Both co-occurrence and lexico-syntactic patterns work well for all three types of relations. It is interesting to see that simple co-occurrence statistics work as good as lexico-syntactic patterns. Contextual features work well for sibling relations, but not for is-a and part-of. Syntactic features also work well for sibling, but not for is-a and part-of. The similar behavior of contextual and syntactic features may be because that four out of five syntactic features (Modifier, Subject, Object, and Verb overlaps) are just surrounding context for a term.","Comparing the is-a and part-of columns in Table 4 and the ME rows in Table 3, we notice a significant difference in F1-measure. It indicates that combination of heterogeneous features gives more rise to the system performance than a single set of features does. 5.5 Features vs. Abstractness This section studies the impact of different sets of features on terms at different abstraction levels. In the experiments, F1-measure is evaluated for terms at each level of a taxonomy, not the whole taxonomy. Table 5 and 6 demonstrate F1-measure of using each set of features alone on each abstraction levels. Columns 2-6 are indices of the levels in a taxonomy. The larger the indices are, the lower the levels. Higher levels contain abstract terms, while lower levels contain concrete terms. L1 is ignored here since it only contains a single term, the root. Bold font indicates good performance in a column.","Both tables show that abstract terms and concrete terms favor different sets of features. In particular, contextual, co-occurrence, pattern, and syntactic features work well for terms at L4-L6, i.e., concrete terms; co-occurrence works well for terms at L2-L3, i.e., abstract terms. This difference indicates that terms at different abstraction levels have different characteristics; it confirms our abstractness assumption in Section 4.1.","We also observe that for abstract terms in WordNet, patterns work better than contextual features; while for abstract terms in ODP, the conclusion is the opposite. This may be because that WordNet has a richer vocabulary and a more rigid definition of hypernyms, and hence is-a relations in WordNet are recognized more effectively by using lexico-syntactic patterns; while ODP contains more noise, and hence it favors features requiring less rigidity, such as the contextual features generated from the Web."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions","paragraphs":["This paper presents a novel metric-based taxonomy induction framework combining the strengths of lexico-syntactic patterns and clustering. The framework incrementally clusters terms and transforms automatic taxonomy induction into a multi-criteria optimization based on minimization of taxonomy structures and modeling of term abstractness. The experiments show that our framework is effective; it achieves higher F1-measure than three state-of-the-art systems. The paper also studies which features are the best for different types of relations and for terms at different abstraction levels.","Most prior work uses a single rule or feature function for automatic taxonomy induction at all levels of abstraction. Our work is a more general framework which allows a wider range of features and different metric functions at different abstraction levels. This more general framework has the potential to learn more complex taxonomies than previous approaches."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This research was supported by NSF grant IIS-0704210.
