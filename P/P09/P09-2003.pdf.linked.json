RCGs generate exactly the class of languages parsable in de-terministic polynomial time (Bertsch and Nederhof, 2001). They are in particular more powerful than linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRS) (Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987). LCFRS is unable to describe certain natural language phenomena that RCGs actually can deal with. One example are long-distance scrambling phenomena (Becker et al., 1991; Becker et al., 1992). Other examples are non-semilinear constructions such as case stacking in Old Georgian (Michaelis and Kracht, 1996) and Chinese number names (Radzinski, 1991). Boullier (1999) shows that RCGs can describe the permutations occurring with scrambling and the construction of Chinese number names.","Parsing algorithms for RCG have been introduced by Boullier (2000), who presents a directional top-down parsing algorithm using pseudocode, and Barthélemy et al. (2001), who add an oracle to Boullier’s algorithm. The more restricted class of LCFRS has received more attention concerning parsing (Villemonte de la Clergerie, 2002; Burden and Ljunglöf, 2005). This article proposes new CYK and Earley parsers for RCG, formulat-ing them in the framework of parsing as deduction (Shieber et al., 1995). The second section introduces necessary definitions. Section 3 presents a CYK-style algorithm and Section 4 extends this with an Earley-style prediction."]},{"title":"2 Preliminaries","paragraphs":["The rules (clauses) of RCGs1","rewrite predicates ranging over parts of the input by other predicates. E.g., a clause S(aXb) → S(X) signifies thatS is true for a part of the input if this part starts with an a, ends with a b, and if, furthermore, S is also true for the part between a and b. Definition 1. A RCG G = ⟨N, T, V, P, S⟩ consists of a) a finite set of predicates N with an arity function dim: N → N \\ {0} where S ∈ N is the start predicate with dim(S) = 1, b) disjoint finite sets of terminals T and variables V , c) a finite set P of clauses ψ0 → ψ1 . . . ψm, where m ≥ 0 and each of the ψi, 0 ≤ i ≤ m, is a predicate of the form Ai(α1, . . . , αdim(Ai)) with Ai ∈ N and αj ∈ (T ∪ V )∗","for 1 ≤ j ≤ dim(A i).","Central to RCGs is the notion of ranges on strings. Definition 2. For every w = w1 . . . wn with wi ∈ T (1 ≤ i ≤ n), we define a) P os(w) = {0, . . . , n}. b) ⟨l, r⟩ ∈ P os(w) × P os(w) with l ≤ r is a range in w. Its yield ⟨l, r⟩(w) is the substring wl+1 . . . wr. c) For two ranges ρ1 = ⟨l1, r1⟩, ρ2 = ⟨l2, r2⟩: if r1 = l2, then ρ1 · ρ2 = ⟨l1, r2⟩; otherwise ρ1 · ρ2 is undefined. d) A vector φ = (⟨x1, y1⟩, . . . , ⟨xk, yk⟩) is a range vector of dimension k in w if ⟨xi, yi⟩ is a range in w for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. φ(i).l (resp. φ(i).r) denotes then the","1","In this paper, by RCG, we always mean positive RCG, see Boullier (2000) for details. 9 first (resp. second) component of the ith element of φ, that is xi (resp. yi).","In order to instantiate a clause of the grammar, we need to find ranges for all variables in the clause and for all occurrences of terminals. For convenience, we assume the variables in a clause and the occurrences of terminals to be equipped with distinct subscript indices, starting with 1 and ordered from left to right (where for variables, only the first occurrence is relevant for this order). We introduce a function Υ : P → N that gives the maximal index in a clause, and we defineΥ(c, x) for a given clause c and x a variable or an occurrence of a terminal as the index of x in c. Definition 3. An instantiation of a c ∈ P with Υ(c) = j w.r.t. to some string w is given by a range vector φ of dimension j. Applying φ to a predicate A(⃗α) in c maps all occurrences of x ∈ (T ∪ V ) with Υ(c, x) = i in ⃗α to φ(i). If the result is defined (i.e., the images of adjacent variables can be concatenated), it is called an instantiated predicate and the result of applying φ to all predicates in c, if defined, is called an instantiated clause.","We also introduce range constraint vectors, vectors of pairs of range boundary variables together with a set of constraints on these variables. Definition 4. Let Vr = {r1, r2, . . . } be a set of range boundary variables. A range constraint vector of dimension k is a pair ⟨⃗ρ, C⟩ where a) ⃗ρ ∈ (V 2","r )k","; we define V","r(⃗ρ) as the set of range boundary variables occurring in ⃗ρ. b) C is a set of constraints cr that have one of the following forms: r1 = r2, k = r1, r1 + k = r2, k ≤ r1, r1 ≤ k, r1 ≤ r2 or r1 + k ≤ r2 for r1, r2 ∈ Vr(⃗ρ) and k ∈ N.","We say that a range vector φ satisfies a range constraint vector ⟨ρ, C⟩ iff φ and ρ are of the same dimension k and there is a function f : Vr → N that maps ρ(i).l to φ(i).l and ρ(i).r to φ(i).r for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k such that all constraints in C are satisfied. Furthermore, we say that a range constraint vector ⟨ρ, C⟩ is satisfiable iff there exists a range vector φ that satisfies it. Definition 5. For every clause c, we define its range constraint vector ⟨ρ, C⟩ w.r.t. a w with |w| = n as follows: a) ρ has dimension Υ(c) and all range boundary variables in ρ are pairwise different. b) For all ⟨r1, r2⟩ ∈ ρ: 0 ≤ r1, r1 ≤ r2, r2 ≤ n ∈ C. For all occurrences x of terminals in c with i = Υ(c, x): ρ(i).l+1 = ρ(i).r ∈ C. For all x, y that are variables or occurrences of terminals in c such that xy is a substring of one of the arguments in c: ρ(Υ(c, x)).r = ρ(Υ(c, y)).l ∈ C. These are all constraints in C.","The range constraint vector of a clause c captures all information about boundaries forming a range, ranges containing only a single terminal, and adjacent variables/terminal occurrences in c.","An RCG derivation consists of rewriting instantiated predicates applying instantiated clauses, i.e. in every derivation step Γ1 ⇒w Γ2, we replace the lefthand side of an instantiated clause with its righthand side (w.r.t. a word w). The language of an RCG G is the set of strings that can be reduced to the empty word: L(G) = {w | S(⟨0, |w|⟩)","+","⇒G,w ε}.","The expressive power of RCG lies beyond mild context-sensitivity. As an example, consider the RCG from Fig. 3 that generates a language that is not semilinear.","For simplicity, we assume in the following with-out loss of generality that empty arguments (ε) occur only in clauses whose righthand sides are empty.2"]},{"title":"3 Directional Bottom-Up Chart Parsing","paragraphs":["In our directional CYK algorithm, we move a dot through the righthand side of a clause. We there-fore have passive items [A, φ] where A is a predicate and φ a range vector of dimension dim(A) and active items. In the latter, while traversing the righthand side of the clause, we keep a record of the left and right boundaries already found for variables and terminal occurrences. This is achieved by subsequently enriching the range constraint vector of the clause. Active items have the form [A(⃗x) → Φ • Ψ, ⟨ρ, C⟩] with A(⃗x) → ΦΨ a clause, ΦΨ ̸= ε, Υ(A(⃗x → ΦΨ)) = j and ⟨ρ, C⟩ a range constraint vector of dimension j.

Then, for every clause c with righthand side not ε, replace every argument ε that occurs in c with a new variable X (each time a distinct one) and add the predicate Eps(X) to the righthand side of c.","3","Items that are distinguished from each other only by a bijection of the range variables are considered equivalent.

The axiom is the prediction of an S ranging over the entire input (initialize). We have two predict operations: Predict-rule predicts active items with the dot on the left of the righthand side, for a given predicted passive item. Predict-pred predicts a passive item for the predicate following the dot in an active item. Scan is applied whenever a predicted predicate can be derived by an ε-clause. The rules complete and convert are the ones from the CYK algorithm except that we add flags c to the passive items occurring in these rules. The goal is again [S, (⟨0, n⟩), c].","To understand how this algorithm works, consider the example in Fig. 3. The crucial property of this algorithm, in contrast to previous approaches, is the dynamic updating of a set of constraints on range boundaries. We can leave range boundaries unspecified and compute their values in a more in-cremental fashion instead of guessing all ranges of a clause at once at prediction.4","For evaluation, we have implemented a directional top-down algorithm where range boundaries are guessed at prediction (this is essentially the algorithm described in Boullier (2000)), and the new Earley-style algorithm.
