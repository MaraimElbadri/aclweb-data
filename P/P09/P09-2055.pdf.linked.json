While such dictionaries are available to and from numerous widely used languages, less represented language pairs have rarely a reliable dictionary with good coverage. The need for bilingual dictionaries for these less common language pairs is increasing, but qualified human resources are scarce. Considering that in these conditions manual compilation is highly costly, alternative methods are imperative.","Pivot language based bilingual dictionary generation is one plausible such alternative (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994; Sjöbergh, 2005; Shirai and Yamamoto, 2001; Bond and Ogura, 2007). These methods do not use large bilingual corpora, thus being suitable for low-resourced languages.","Our paper presents iChi, the implementation of our own method, an easy-to-use, customizable tool that generates a bilingual dictionary.","The paper is structured as follows: first we briefly describe the methodological background of our tool, after which we describe its basic functions, concluding with discussions. Thorough description and evaluation, including comparative analysis, are available in Varga and Yokoyama (2009)."]},{"title":"2 Methodological background 2.1 Pivot based dictionary generation","paragraphs":["Pivot language based bilingual dictionary generation methods rely on the idea that the lookup of a word in an uncommon language through a third, intermediated language can be automated. Bilingual dictionaries to a third, intermediate language are used to link the source and target words. The pivot language translations of the source and target head words are compared, the suitability of the source-target word pair being estimated based on the extent of the common elements.","There are two known problems of conventional pivot methods. First, a global threshold is used to determine correct translation pairs. However, the scores highly depend on the entry itself or the number of translations in the intermediate language, therefore there is a variance in what that score represents. Second, current methods perform a strictly lexical overlap of the source-intermediate and target-intermediate entries. Even if the translations from the source and target languages are semantically transferred to the intermediate language, lexically it is rarely the case. However, due to the different word-usage or paraphrases, even semantically identical or very similar words can have different definitions in different dictionaries. As a result, because of the lexical characteristic of their overlap, current methods cannot identify the differences between totally different definitions resulted by unrelated concepts, and differences in only nuances resulted by lexicographers describing the same concept, but with different words. 2.2 Specifics of our method To overcome the limitations, namely low precision of previous pivot methods, we expand the translations in the intermediate language using 217 information extracted from WordNet (Miller et. al., 1990). We use the following information: sense description, synonymy, antonymy and semantic categories, provided by the tree structure of nouns and verbs.","To improve recall, we introduce bidirectional selection. As we stated above, the global threshold eliminates a large number of good translation pairs, resulting in a low recall. As a solution, we can group the translations that share the same source or target entry, and set local thresholds for each head word. For example, for a source language head word entry_source there could be multiple target language candidates: entry_target1, ... ,entry_targetn. If the top scoring entry_targetk candidates are selected, we ensure that at least one translation will be available for entry_source, maintaining a high recall. Since we can group the entries in the source language and target language as well, we perform this selection twice, once in each direction. Local thresholds depend on the top scoring entry_target, being set to maxscore·c. Constant c varies between 0 and 1, allowing a small window for not maximum, but high scoring candidates. It is language and selection method dependent (See 3.2 for details). 2.3 Brief method description First, using the source-pivot and pivot-target dictionaries, we connect the source (s) and target (t) entries that share at least one common translation in the intermediate (i) language. We consider each such source-target pair a translation candidate. Next we eliminate erroneous candidates. We examine the translation candidates one by one, looking up the source-pivot and target-pivot dictionaries, comparing pivot language translations. There are six types of translations that we label A-F and explain below as follows.","First, we select translation candidates whose translations into the intermediate language match perfectly (type A translations).","For most words WordNet offers sense description in form of synonyms for most of its senses. For a given translation candidate (s,t) we look up the source-pivot and target-pivot translations (s→I={s→i1,...,s→in}, t→I={t→i1,...,t→im}). We select the elements that are common in the two definitions (I’=(s→I)∩(t→I)) and we at-tempt to identify their respective senses from WordNet (sns(I’)), comparing each synonym in the WordNet’s synonym description with each word from the pivot translations. As a result, we arrive at a certain set of senses from the source-pivot definitions (sns((s→I’)) and target-pivot definitions (sns((t→I’)). We mark scoreB(s,t) the Jaccard coefficient of these two sets. Scores that pass a global threshold (0.1) are selected as translation pairs. Since synonymy information is available for nouns (N), verbs (V), adjectives (A) and adverbs (R), four separate scores are calculated for each POS (type B).

The similarity of the two expanded pivot language descriptions gives a better indication on the suitability of the translation candidate. Since the same word or concept’s translations into the pivot language also share the same semantic value, the extension with synonyms (ext(l→i)=(l→i)∪syn(l→i), where l={s,t}) the extended translation should share more common elements (type C).","In case of antonymy, we expand the initial definitions with the antonyms of the antonyms (ext(l→i)=(l→i)∪ant(ant(l→i)), where l={s,t}). This extension is different from the synonymy extension, in most cases the resulting set of words being considerably larger (type D).","Synonymy and antonymy information are available for nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, thus four separate scores are calculated for each POS.","Semantic categories are provided by the tree structure (hypernymy/hyponymy) of nouns and verbs of WordNet. We transpose each entry from the pivot translations to its semantic category (ext(l→i)=(l→i)∪semcat(l→i), where l={s,t}). We assume that the correct translation pairs share a high percentage of semantic categories.","Local thresholds are set based on the best scoring candidate for a given entry. The thresholds were maxscore·0.9 for synonymy and antonymy; and maxscore·0.8 for the semantic categories (see §3.2 for details)."]},{"title":"( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )","paragraphs":["itextisext itextisext tsscore EDC","→∪→ →∩→ =,,, (2)","For a given entry, the three separate candidate lists of type C, D and E selection methods resulted in slightly different results. The good translations were among the top scoring ones, but not always scoring best. To correct this fault, a combined selection method is performed combining these lists. For every translation candidate we select the maximum score (scorerel(s,t)) from 218 the several POS (noun, verb, adjective and adverb for synonymy and antonymy relations; noun and verb for semantic category) based scores, multiplied by a multiplication factor (mfactor). This factor varies between 0 and 1, awarding the candidates that were selected both times during the double directional selection; and punishing when selection was made only in a single direc-tion. c1, c2 and c3 are adjustable language dependent constants, the defaults being 1, 0.5 and 0.8, respectively (type F)."]},{"title":"( ) ( )( )( ) ( )( )∏","paragraphs":["      ⋅+ ⋅+ = rel rel rel F tsmfactorcc tsscorec tsscore , ,max , 32 1 (3) 2.4 Evaluation We generated a Japanese-Hungarian dictionary using selection methods A, B and F; with C, D and E contributing indirectly through F. (a) Recall evaluation We used a Japanese frequency dictionary that we generated from the Japanese EDR corpus (Isahara, 2007) to weight each Japanese entry. Setting the standard to the frequency dictionary (its recall value being 100), we automatically search each entry from the frequency dictionary, verifying whether or not it is included in the bilingual dictionary. If it is recalled, we weight it with its frequency from the frequency dictionary.","Our method maintains the recall value of the initial translation candidates, owing to the bidirectional selection method with local thresholds.

(c) 1-to-multiple evaluation With 1-to-multiple evaluation we quantify the true reliability of the dictionary: when looking up the meanings or translations of a certain key-word, the user, whether he’s a human or a machine, expects all translations to be accurate. We evaluated 2000 randomly selected Japanese entries from the initial translation candidates, scoring all Hungarian translations as correct (all translations are correct: 71.45%), acceptable (the good translations are predominant, but there are up to 2 erroneous translations: 13.85%), wrong (the number or wrong translations exceeds 2: 14.70%)."]},{"title":"3 iChi","paragraphs":["iChi is an implementation of our method. Programmed in Java, it is a platform-independent tool with a user friendly graphical interface (Image 1). Besides the MySql database it consists of: iChi.jar (java executable), iChi.cfg (configuration file), iChi.log (log file) and iChip.jar (parameter estimation tool). The major functions of iChi are briefly explained below.

For example, with Hungarian-Japanese we considered all translation candidates whose Hungarian entry starts with “zs” (IPA: ʒ). 133 head words totalling 515 translation candidates comprise this set, 273 entries being marked as correct. iChip experimented with a number of thresholds to determine which ones provide with the best F-scores, e.g. retain most marked correct translations (Table 2). The F-scores were determined as follows: for example using synonymy information (type C) in case of threshold=0.85%, 343 of the 515 translation pairs were above the threshold. Among these, 221 were marked as correct, thus the precision being 221/343·100=64.43 and the recall being 221/273·100=80.95.

If one polysemous pivot entry has multiple translations into the source, but only some of them are translated into the target languages, unique, but incorrect source-target pairs will be generated. For example, with an English pivoted dictionary that has multiple translation of ‘bank’ onto the source (‘financial institution’, ‘river bank’), but only one into the target language (‘river bank’), the incorrect source(‘financial institution’)- target(‘river bank’) pair will be generated, since target(‘river bank’) has no other alternative.","Thorough discussion on recall and precision problems concerning the methodology of iChi, are available in Varga and Yokoyama (2009)."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this paper we presented iChi, a user friendly tool that uses two dictionaries into a third, intermediate language together with the WordNet of that third language to generate a new dictionary.
