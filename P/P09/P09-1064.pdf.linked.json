A decoding objective specifies how to derive final translations from a system’s underlying statistical model. The Bayes optimal decoding objective is to minimize risk based on the similarity measure used for evaluation. The corresponding minimum Bayes risk (MBR) procedure maximizes the expected similarity score of a system’s translations relative to the model’s distribution over possible translations (Kumar and Byrne, 2004). Unfortunately, with a non-linear similarity measure like BLEU, we must resort to approximating the expected loss using a k-best list, which accounts for only a tiny fraction of a model’s full posterior distribution. In this paper, we introduce a variant of the MBR decoding procedure that applies efficiently to translation forests. Instead of maximizing expected similarity, we express similarity in terms of features of sentences, and choose translations that are similar to expected feature values.","Our exposition begins with algorithms over k-best lists. A naı̈ve algorithm for finding MBR translations computes the similarity between every pair of k sentences, entailing O(k2",") comparisons. We show that if the similarity measure is linear in features of a sentence, then computing expected similarity for all k sentences requires only k similarity evaluations. Specific instances of this general algorithm have recently been proposed for two linear similarity measures (Tromble et al., 2008; Zhang and Gildea, 2008).","However, the sentence similarity measures we want to optimize in MT are not linear functions, and so this fast algorithm for MBR does not apply. For this reason, we propose a new objective that retains the benefits of MBR, but can be optimized efficiently, even for non-linear similarity measures. In experiments using BLEU over 1000-best lists, we found that our objective provided benefits very similar to MBR, only much faster.","This same decoding objective can also be computed efficiently from forest-based expectations. Translation forests compactly encode distributions over much larger sets of derivations and arise naturally in chart-based decoding for a wide variety of hierarchical translation systems (Chiang, 2007; Galley et al., 2006; Mi et al., 2008; Venugopal et al., 2007). The resulting forest-based decoding procedure compares favorably in both complexity and performance to the recently proposed lattice-based MBR (Tromble et al., 2008).","The contributions of this paper include a linear-time algorithm for MBR using linear similarities, a linear-time alternative to MBR using non-linear similarity measures, and a forest-based extension to this procedure for similarities based on n-gram counts. In experiments, we show that our fast procedure is on average 80 times faster than MBR using 1000-best lists. We also show that using forests outperforms using k-best lists consistently across language pairs. Finally, in the first published multi-system experiments on consensus de-567 coding for translation, we demonstrate that benefits can differ substantially across systems. In all, we show improvements of up to 1.0 BLEU from consensus approaches for state-of-the-art large-scale hierarchical translation systems."]},{"title":"2 Consensus Decoding Algorithms","paragraphs":["Let e be a candidate translation for a sentence f , where e may stand for a sentence or its derivation as appropriate.

There are some nuances of this procedure, however. First, the precise form of S(e; φ(e′",")) will affect the output, but S(e; E[φ(e′",")]) is often an input point for which a sentence similarity measure S was not originally defined. For example, our definition of BLEU above will have integer valued φ(e′",") for any real sentence e′",", but E[φ(e′",")] will not be integer valued. As a result, we are extending the domain of BLEU beyond its original intent. One could imagine different feature-based expressions that also produce BLEU scores for real sentences, but produce different values for fractional features. Some care must be taken to define S(e; φ(e′",")) to extend naturally from integer-valued to real-valued features.","Second, while any similarity measure can in principle be expressed as S(e; φ(e′",")) for a suffi-ciently rich feature space, fast consensus decoding will not apply effectively to all functions.

In this example, we normalized inside scores at all nodes to 1 for clarity. lists, compact encodings of translation distributions have proven effective for MBR (Zhang and Gildea, 2008; Tromble et al., 2008). In this section, we consider BLEU in particular, for which the relevant features φ(e) are n-gram counts up to length n = 4. We show how to compute expectations of these counts efficiently from translation forests. 3.1 Translation Forests Translation forests compactly encode an exponential number of output translations for an input sentence, along with their model scores. Forests arise naturally in chart-based decoding procedures for many hierarchical translation systems (Chiang, 2007). Exploiting forests has proven a fruitful avenue of research in both parsing (Huang, 2008) and machine translation (Mi et al., 2008).","Formally, translation forests are weighted acyclic hyper-graphs. The nodes are states in the decoding process that include the span (i, j) of the sentence to be translated, the grammar symbol s over that span, and the left and right context words of the translation relevant for computing n-gram language model scores.3","Each hyper-edge h represents the application of a synchronous rule r that combines nodes corresponding to non-terminals in","3","Decoder states can include additional information as well, such as local configurations for dependency language model scoring. 570 r into a node spanning the union of the child spans and perhaps some additional portion of the input sentence covered directly by r’s lexical items. The weight of h is the incremental score contributed to all translations containing the rule application, including translation model features on r and language model features that depend on both r and the English contexts of the child nodes. Figure 2 depicts a forest.","Each n-gram that appears in a translation e is as-sociated with some h in its derivation: the h corresponding to the rule that produces the n-gram. Unigrams are produced by lexical rules, while higherorder n-grams can be produced either directly by lexical rules, or by combining constituents. The n-gram language model score of e similarly decomposes over the h in e that produce n-grams. 3.2 Computing Expected N-Gram Counts We can compute expected n-gram counts efficiently from a translation forest by appealing to the linearity of expectations. Let φ(e) be a vector of n-gram counts for a sentence e. Then, φ(e) is the sum of hyper-edge-specific n-gram count vectors φ(h) for all h in e. Therefore, E[φ(e)] =∑","h∈e E[φ(h)].","To compute n-gram expectations for a hyper-edge, we first compute the posterior probability of each h, conditioned on the input sentence f : P(h|f ) = ( ∑ e:h∈e bλ·θ(f,e) ) ( ∑ e bλ·θ(f,e) ) −1 , where e iterates over translations in the forest. We compute the numerator using the inside-outside algorithm, while the denominator is the inside score of the root node. Note that many possible derivations of f are pruned from the forest during decoding, and so this posterior is approximate.","The expected n-gram count vector for a hyper-edge is E[φ(h)] = P(h|f ) · φ(h). Hence, after computing P (h|f ) for every h, we need only sum P(h|f ) · φ(h) for all h to compute E[φ(e)]. This entire procedure is a linear-time computation in the number of hyper-edges in the forest.","To complete forest-based fast consensus decoding, we then extract a k-best list of unique translations from the forest (Huang et al., 2006) and continue Algorithm 3 from line 5, which chooses the ẽ from the k-best list that maximizes BLEU(e; E[φ(e′",")]). 3.3 Comparison to Related Work Zhang and Gildea (2008) embed a consensus decoding procedure into a larger multi-pass decoding framework. They focus on inversion transduction grammars, but their ideas apply to richer models as well. They propose an MBR decoding objective of maximizing the expected number of matching constituent counts relative to the model’s distribution. The corresponding constituent-matching similarity measure can be expressed as a linear function of features of e′",", which are indicators of constituents. Expectations of constituent indicator features are the same as posterior constituent probabilities, which can be computed from a translation forest using the inside-outside algorithm. This forest-based MBR approach improved translation output relative to Viterbi translations.","Tromble et al. (2008) describe a similar approach using MBR with a linear similarity measure. They derive a first-order Taylor approximation to the logarithm of a slightly modified definition of corpus BLEU4",", which is linear in n-gram indicator features δ(e′",", t) of e′",". These features are weighted by n-gram counts c(e, t) and constants θ that are estimated from held-out data. The linear similarity measure takes the following form, where Tn is the set of n-grams:","G(e; e′ ) = θ 0|e| + 4 ∑ n=1 ∑ t∈Tn","θt · c(e, t) · δ(e′ , t). Using G, Tromble et al. (2008) extend MBR to word lattices, which improves performance over k-best list MBR.","Our approach differs from Tromble et al. (2008) primarily in that we propose decoding with an alternative to MBR using BLEU, while they propose decoding with MBR using a linear alternative to BLEU. The specifics of our approaches also differ in important ways.","First, word lattices are a subclass of forests that have only one source node for each edge (i.e., a graph, rather than a hyper-graph). While forests are more general, the techniques for computing posterior edge probabilities in lattices and forests are similar. One practical difference is that the forests needed for fast consensus decoding are","4","The log-BLEU function must be modified slightly to yield a linear Taylor approximation: Tromble et al. (2008) replace the clipped n-gram count with the product of an n-gram count and an n-gram indicator function. 571 generated already by the decoder of a syntactic translation system.","Second, rather than use BLEU as a sentence-level similarity measure directly, Tromble et al. (2008) approximate corpus BLEU with G above. The parameters θ of the approximation must be estimated on a held-out data set, while our approach requires no such estimation step.","Third, our approach is also simpler computationally. The features required to compute G are indicators δ(e′",", t); the features relevant to us are counts c(e′",", t). Tromble et al. (2008) compute expected feature values by intersecting the translation lattice with a lattices for each n-gram t. By contrast, expectations of c(e′",", t) can all be computed with a single pass over the forest. This con-trast implies a complexity difference. Let H be the number of hyper-edges in the forest or lattice, and T the number of n-grams that can potentially appear in a translation. Computing indicator expectations seems to require O(H · T ) time because of automata intersections. Computing count expectations requires O(H) time, because only a constant number of n-grams can be produced by each hyper-edge.","Our approaches also differ in the space of translations from which ẽ is chosen. A linear similarity measure like G allows for efficient search over the lattice or forest, whereas fast consensus decoding restricts this search to a k-best list. However, Tromble et al. (2008) showed that most of the improvement from lattice-based consensus decoding comes from lattice-based expectations, not search: searching over lattices instead of k-best lists did not change results for two language pairs, and improved a third language pair by 0.3 BLEU. Thus, we do not consider our use of k-best lists to be a substantial liability of our approach.","Fast consensus decoding is also similar in character to the concurrently developed variational decoding approach of Li et al. (2009). Using BLEU, both approaches choose outputs that match expected n-gram counts from forests, though differ in the details. It is possible to define a similarity measure under which the two approaches are equivalent.5 5 For example, decoding under a variational approxima-","tion to the model’s posterior that decomposes over bigram","probabilities is equivalent to fast consensus decoding with","the similarity measure B(e; e′",") = Q","t∈T","2 h c(e′",",t)","c(e′ ,h(t)) ic(e,t) , where h(t) is the unigram prefix of bigram t."]},{"title":"4 Experimental Results","paragraphs":["We evaluate these consensus decoding techniques on two different full-scale state-of-the-art hierarchical machine translation systems.

No explicit syntactic information appears in the core model. A phrase discovery procedure over word-aligned sentence pairs provides rule frequency counts, which are normalized to estimate features on rules.","The grammar rules of Hiero all share a single non-terminal symbol X, and have at most two non-terminals and six total items (non-terminals and lexical items), for example: my X2 ’s X1 → X1 de mi X2 We extracted the grammar from training data using standard parameters.

Algorithms 1 and 3 gave the same small BLEU improvements in each data condition up to three significant figures.","The two algorithms differed greatly in speed, as shown in Table 1. For Algorithm 1, we terminated the computation of E[BLEU (e; e′",")] for each e whenever e could not become the maximal hypothesis. MBR speed depended on how often this shortcut applied, which varied by language and system. Despite this optimization, our new Algorithm 3 was an average of 80 times faster across systems and language pairs. 4.5 Results for Forest-Based Decoding Table 2 contrasts Algorithm 3 over 104","-best lists and forests.

In particular, consensus decoding with BLEU chooses translations using n-gram count expectations E[c(e, t)]. Improvements in translation quality should therefore be directly at-tributable to information in these expected counts.","We endeavored to test the hypothesis that expected n-gram counts under the forest distribution carry more predictive information than the baseline Viterbi derivation e∗",", which is the mode of the distribution. To this end, we first tested the predictive accuracy of the n-grams proposed by e∗",": the fraction of the n-grams in e∗","that appear in a reference translation. We compared this n-gram precision to a similar measure of predictive accuracy for expected n-gram counts: the fraction of the n-grams t with E[c(e, t)] ≥ ρ that appear in a reference. To make these two precisions comparable, we chose ρ such that the recall of reference n-grams was equal. Figure 3 shows that computing n-gram expectations—which sum over translations—improves the model’s ability to predict which n-grams will appear in the reference. min(1, E[c(e′",", t)]). Assuming an n-gram appears at most once per sentence, these expressions are equivalent, and this assumption holds for most n-grams.","Reference translation: Mubarak said that he received a telephone call from Sharon in which he said he was “ready (to resume negotiations) but the Palestinians are hesitant.”","Baseline translation: Mubarak said he had received a telephone call from Sharon told him he was ready to resume talks with the Palestinians.","Fast forest-based consensus translation: Mubarak said that he had received a telephone call from Sharon told him that he “was ready to resume the negotiations) , but the Palestinians are hesitant.” Figure 4: Three translations of an example Arabic sentence: its human-generated reference, the translation with the highest model score under Hiero (Viterbi), and the translation chosen by forest-based consensus decoding. The consensus translation reconstructs content lost in the Viterbi translation. We attribute gains from fast consensus decoding to this increased predictive accuracy.","Examining the translations chosen by fast consensus decoding, we found that gains in BLEU often arose from improved lexical choice. However, in our hierarchical systems, consensus decoding did occasionally trigger large reordering. We also found examples where the translation quality improved by recovering content that was missing from the baseline translation, as in Figure 4."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have demonstrated substantial speed increases in k-best consensus decoding through a new procedure inspired by MBR under linear similarity measures. To further improve this approach, we computed expected n-gram counts from translation forests instead of k-best lists. Fast consensus decoding using forest-based n-gram expectations and BLEU as a similarity measure yielded consistent improvements over MBR with k-best lists, yet required only simple computations that scale linearly with the size of the translation forest.","The space of similarity measures is large and relatively unexplored, and the feature expectations that can be computed from forests extend beyond n-gram counts. Therefore, future work may show additional benefits from fast consensus decoding."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work was supported under DARPA GALE, Contract No. HR0011-06-C-0022. 574"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Abhaya Agarwal and Alon Lavie. 2007.
