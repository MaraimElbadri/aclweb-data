Availability of multiple treebanks creates a scenario where we have a treebank annotated with one grammar formalism, and another treebank annotated with another grammar formalism that we are interested in. We call the first a source treebank, and the second a target treebank. We thus encounter a problem of how to use these heterogeneous treebanks for target grammar parsing. Here heterogeneous treebanks refer to two or more treebanks with different grammar formalisms, e.g., one treebank annotated with dependency structure (DS) and the other annotated with phrase structure (PS).","It is important to acquire additional labeled data for the target grammar parsing through exploita-tion of existing source treebanks since there is often a shortage of labeled data. However, to our knowledge, there is no previous study on this issue.","Recently there have been some works on using multiple treebanks for domain adaptation of parsers, where these treebanks have the same grammar formalism (McClosky et al., 2006b; Roark and Bacchiani, 2003). Other related works focus on converting one grammar formalism of a treebank to another and then conducting studies on the converted treebank (Collins et al., 1999; Forst, 2003; Wang et al., 1994; Watkinson and Manandhar, 2001). These works were done either on multiple treebanks with the same grammar formalism or on only one converted treebank. We see that their scenarios are different from ours as we work with multiple heterogeneous treebanks.","For the use of heterogeneous treebanks1",", we propose a two-step solution: (1) converting the grammar formalism of the source treebank to the target one, (2) refining converted trees and using them as additional training data to build a target grammar parser.","For grammar formalism conversion, we choose the DS to PS direction for the convenience of the comparison with existing works (Xia and Palmer, 2001; Xia et al., 2008). Specifically, we assume that the source grammar formalism is dependency","1","Here we assume the existence of two treebanks. 46 grammar, and the target grammar formalism is phrase structure grammar.","Previous methods for DS to PS conversion (Collins et al., 1999; Covington, 1994; Xia and Palmer, 2001; Xia et al., 2008) often rely on predefined heuristic rules to eliminate converison ambiguity, e.g., minimal projection for dependents, lowest attachment position for dependents, and the selection of conversion rules that add fewer number of nodes to the converted tree. In addition, the validity of these heuristic rules often depends on their target grammars. To eliminate the heuristic rules as required in previous methods, we propose to use an existing target grammar parser (trained on the target treebank) to generate N-best parses for each sentence in the source treebank as conversion candidates, and then select the parse consis-tent with the structure of the source tree as the converted tree. Furthermore, we attempt to use converted trees as additional training data to retrain the parser for better conversion candidates. The procedure of tree conversion and parser retraining will be run iteratively until a stopping condition is satisfied.","Since some converted trees might be imperfect from the perspective of the target grammar, we provide two strategies to refine conversion results: (1) pruning low-quality trees from the converted treebank, (2) interpolating the scores from the source grammar and the target grammar to select better converted trees. Finally we adopt a corpus weighting technique to get an optimal combination of the converted treebank and the existing target treebank for parser training.","We have evaluated our conversion algorithm on a dependency structure treebank (produced from the Penn Treebank) for comparison with previous work (Xia et al., 2008). We also have investigated our two-step solution on two existing treebanks, the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) (Xue et al., 2005) and the Chinese Dependency Treebank (CDT)2","(Liu et al., 2006). Evaluation on WSJ data demonstrates that it is feasible to use a parser for grammar formalism conversion and the conversion benefits from converted trees used for parser retraining. Our conversion method achieves 93.8% f-score on dependency trees produced from WSJ section 22, resulting in 42% error reduction over the previous best result for DS to PS conversion. Results on CTB show that score interpolation is 2 Available at http://ir.hit.edu.cn/. more effective than instance pruning for the use of converted treebanks for parsing and converted CDT helps parsing on CTB. When coupled with self-training technique, a reranking parser with CTB and converted CDT as labeled data achieves 85.2% f-score on CTB test set, an absolute 1.0% improvement (6% error reduction) over the previous best result for Chinese parsing.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we first describe a parser based method for DS to PS conversion, and then we discuss possible strategies to refine conversion results, and finally we adopt the corpus weighting technique for parsing on homogeneous treebanks. Section 3 provides experimental results of grammar formalism conversion on a dependency treebank produced from the Penn Treebank. In Section 4, we evaluate our two-step solution on two existing heterogeneous Chinese treebanks. Section 5 reviews related work and Section 6 concludes this work."]},{"title":"2 Our Two-Step Solution 2.1 Grammar Formalism Conversion","paragraphs":["Previous DS to PS conversion methods built a converted tree by iteratively attaching nodes and edges to the tree with the help of conversion rules and heuristic rules, based on current head-dependent pair from a source dependency tree and the structure of the built tree (Collins et al., 1999; Covington, 1994; Xia and Palmer, 2001; Xia et al., 2008). Some observations can be made on these methods: (1) for each head-dependent pair, only one locally optimal conversion was kept during tree-building process, at the risk of pruning globally optimal conversions, (2) heuristic rules are required to deal with the problem that one head-dependent pair might have multiple conversion candidates, and these heuristic rules are usually hand-crafted to reflect the structural preference in their target grammars. To overcome these limitations, we propose to employ a parser to generate N-best parses as conversion candidates and then use the structural information of source trees to select the best parse as a converted tree.","We formulate our conversion method as follows.","Let CDS be a source treebank annotated with DS and CP S be a target treebank annotated with PS. Our goal is to convert the grammar formalism of CDS to that of CP S.","We first train a constituency parser on CP S 47","Input: CP S, CDS, Q, and a constituency parser Output: Converted trees CDS P S 1.

(90% trees in CP S as training set CP S,train, and other trees as development set CP S,dev) and then let the parser generate N-best parses for each sentence in CDS.","Let n be the number of sentences (or trees) in CDS and ni be the number of N-best parses generated by the parser for the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ n) sentence in CDS. Let xi,t be the t-th (1 ≤ t ≤ ni) parse for the i-th sentence. Let yi be the tree of the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ n) sentence in CDS.","To evaluate the quality of xi,t as a conversion candidate for yi, we convert xi,t to a dependency tree (denoted as xDS","i,t ) and then use unlabeled dependency f-score to measure the similarity between xDS","i,t and yi. Let Score(xi,t) denote the unlabeled dependency f-score of xDS","i,t against yi. Then we determine the converted tree for yi by maximizing Score(xi,t) over the N-best parses.","The conversion from PS to DS works as follows:","Step 1. Use a head percolation table to find the head of each constituent in xi,t.","Step 2. Make the head of each non-head child depend on the head of the head child for each constituent.","Unlabeled dependency f-score is a harmonic mean of unlabeled dependency precision and unlabeled dependency recall. Precision measures how many head-dependent word pairs found in xDS","i,t are correct and recall is the percentage of head-dependent word pairs defined in the gold-standard tree that are found in xDS","i,t . Here we do not take dependency tags into consideration for evaluation since they cannot be obtained without more sophisticated rules.","To improve the quality of N-best parses, we attempt to use the converted trees as additional training data to retrain the parser. The procedure of tree conversion and parser retraining can be run iteratively until a termination condition is satisfied. Here we use the parser’s f-score on CP S,dev as a termination criterion. If the update of training data hurts the performance on CP S,dev, then we stop the iteration.","Table 1 shows this DS to PS conversion algorithm. Q is an upper limit of the number of loops, and Q ≥ 0. 2.2 Target Grammar Parsing Through grammar formalism conversion, we have successfully turned the problem of using heterogeneous treebanks for parsing into the problem of parsing on homogeneous treebanks. Before using converted source treebank for parsing, we present two strategies to refine conversion results.","Instance Pruning For some sentences in CDS, the parser might fail to generate high quality N-best parses, resulting in inferior converted trees. To clean the converted treebank, we can remove the converted trees with low unlabeled dependency f-scores (defined in Section 2.1) before using the converted treebank for parser training 48 Figure 1: A parse tree in CTB for a sentence of / › .<world> <every> I<country> < ‹<people> <all> r<with> 8 1<eyes> <cast> l<Hong Kong>0with /People from all over the world are cast-ing their eyes on Hong Kong0as its English translation. because these trees are /misleading0training in-stances. The number of removed trees will be determined by cross validation on development set.","Score Interpolation Unlabeled dependency f-scores used in Section 2.1 measure the quality of converted trees from the perspective of the source grammar only. In extreme cases, the top best parses in the N-best list are good conversion candidates but we might select a parse ranked quite low in the N-best list since there might be conflicts of syntactic structure definition between the source grammar and the target grammar.","Figure 1 shows an example for illustration of a conflict between the grammar of CDT and that of CTB. According to Chinese head percolation tables used in the PS to DS conversion tool /Penn2Malt03","and Charniak’s parser4",", the head of VP-2 is the word /r0(a preposition, with /BA0as its POS tag in CTB), and the head of IP-OBJ is 0. Therefore the word / 0depends on the word /r0. But according to the annotation scheme in CDT (Liu et al., 2006), the word /r0is a dependent of the word / 0. The conflicts between the two grammars may lead to the problem that the selected parses based on the information of the source grammar might not be preferred from the perspective of the 3 Available at http://w3.msi.vxu.se/∼nivre/. 4 Available at http://www.cs.brown.edu/∼ec/. target grammar.","Therefore we modified the selection metric in Section 2.1 by interpolating two scores, the probability of a conversion candidate from the parser and its unlabeled dependency f-score, shown as follows: ̂Score(xi,t) = λ×P rob(xi,t)+(1−λ)×Score(xi,t). (1) The intuition behind this equation is that converted trees should be preferred from the perspective of both the source grammar and the target grammar. Here 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1. P rob(xi,t) is a probability produced by the parser for xi,t (0 ≤ P rob(xi,t) ≤ 1). The value of λ will be tuned by cross validation on development set.","After grammar formalism conversion, the problem now we face has been limited to how to build parsing models on multiple homogeneous treebank. A possible solution is to simply concatenate the two treebanks as training data. However this method may lead to a problem that if the size of CP S is significantly less than that of converted CDS, converted CDS may weaken the effect CP S might have. One possible solution is to reduce the weight of examples from converted CDS in parser training. Corpus weighting is exactly such an approach, with the weight tuned on development set, that will be used for parsing on homogeneous treebanks in this paper."]},{"title":"3 Experiments of Grammar Formalism Conversion 3.1 Evaluation on WSJ section 22","paragraphs":["Xia et al.

It motivates us to employ self-training technique for Chinese parsing. We used the POS tagged People Daily corpus9 (Jan. 1998∼Jun. 1998, and Jan. 2000∼Dec. 2000) (PDC) as unlabeled data for parsing. First we removed the sentences with less than 3 words or more than 40 words from PDC to ease parsing, resulting in 820k sentences.

(1994) did not exploit the use of converted trees for parser retraining."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have proposed a two-step solution to deal with the issue of using heterogeneous treebanks for parsing. First we present a parser based method to convert grammar formalisms of the treebanks to the same one, without applying predefined heuristic rules, thus turning the original problem into the problem of parsing on homogeneous treebanks. Then we present two strategies, instance pruning and score interpolation, to refine conversion results. Finally we adopt the corpus weighting technique to combine the converted source treebank with the existing target treebank for parser training.","The study on the WSJ data shows the benefits of our parser based approach for grammar formalism conversion. Moreover, experimental results on the Penn Chinese Treebank indicate that a converted dependency treebank helps constituency parsing, and it is better to exploit probability information produced by the parser through score interpolation than to prune low quality trees for the use of the converted treebank.","Future work includes further investigation of our conversion method for other pairs of grammar formalisms, e.g., from the grammar formalism of the Penn Treebank to more deep linguistic formalism like CCG, HPSG, or LFG."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Anne Abeille, Lionel Clement and Francois Toussenel. 2000.
