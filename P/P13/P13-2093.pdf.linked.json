However, the performance of such approach sometimes remains rather limited due to some fundamental deficiencies of the BOW model. In this paper, we focus on the polarity shift problem, and propose a novel approach, called dual training and dual prediction (DTDP), to address it. The basic idea of DTDP is to first generate artificial samples that are polarity-opposite to the original samples by polarity reversion, and then leverage both the original and opposite samples for (dual) training and (dual) prediction. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for polarity classification."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The most popular text representation model in machine learning based sentiment classification is known as the bag-of-words (BOW) model, where a piece of text is represented by an unordered collection of words, based on which standard machine learning algorithms are employed as classifiers. Although the BOW model is simple and has achieved great successes in topic-based text classification, it disrupts word order, breaks the syntactic structures and discards some kinds of semantic information that are possibly very important for sentiment classification. Such disadvantages sometimes limit the performance of sentiment classification systems.","A lot of subsequent work focused on feature engineering that aims to find a set of effective features based on the BOW representation. However, there still remain some problems that are not well addressed. Out of them, the polarity shift problem is the biggest one.","We refer to “polarity shift” as a linguistic phenomenon that the sentiment orientation of a text is reversed (from positive to negative or vice versa) because of some particular expressions called polarity shifters. Negation words (e.g., “no”, “not” and “don’t”) are the most important type of polarity shifter. For example, by adding a negation word “don’t” to a positive text “I like this book” in front of “like”, the orientation of the text is reversed from positive to negative.","Naturally, handling polarity shift is very important for sentiment classification. However, the BOW representations of two polarity-opposite texts, e.g., “I like this book” and “I don’t like this book”, are considered to be very similar by most of machine learning algorithms. Although some methods have been proposed in the literature to address the polarity shift problem (Das and Chen, 2001; Pang et al., 2002; Na et al., 2004; Kenndey and Inkpen, 2006; Ikeda et al., 2008; Li and Huang, 2009; Li et al., 2010), the state-of-the-art results are still far from satisfactory. For example, the improvements are less than 2% after considering polarity shift in Li et al. (2010).","In this work, we propose a novel approach, called dual training and dual prediction (DTDP), to address the polarity shift problem. By taking advantage of the unique nature of polarity classification, DTDP is motivated by first generating artificial samples that are polarity-opposite to the original ones. For example, given the original sample “I don’t like this book. It is boring,” its polarity-opposite version, “I like this book. It is interesting”, is artificially generated. Second, the original and opposite training samples are used together for training a sentiment classifier (called dual training), and the original and opposite test samples are used together for prediction (called dual prediction). Experimental results prove that the procedure of DTDP is very effective at correcting the training and prediction errors caused 521  by polarity shift, and it beats other alternative methods of considering polarity shift."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["The lexicon-based sentiment classification systems can be easily modified to include polarity shift. One common way is to directly reverse the sentiment orientation of polarity-shifted words, and then sum up the orientations word by word (Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Polanyi and Zaenen, 2004; Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006). Wilson et al. (2005) discussed other complex negation effects by using conjunctive and dependency relations among polarity words. Although handling polarity shift is easy and effective in term-counting systems, they rarely outperform the baselines of machine learning methods (Kennedy, 2006).","The machine learning methods are generally more effective for sentiment classification. However, it is difficult to handle polarity shift based on the BOW model. Das and Chen (2001) proposed a method by simply attaching “NOT” to words in the scope of negation, so that in the text “I don’t like book”, the word “like” is changed to a new word “like-NOT”. There were also some attempts to model polarity shift by using more complex linguistic features (Na et al., 2004; Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006). But the improvements upon the baselines of machine learning systems are very slight (less than 1%).","Ikeda et al. (2008) proposed a machine learning method, to model polarity-shifters for both word-wise and sentence-wise sentiment classification, based on a dictionary extracted from General Inquirer. Li and Huang (2009) proposed a method first to classify each sentence in a text into a polarity-unshifted part and a polarity-shifted part according to certain rules, then to represent them as two bag-of-words for sentiment classification. Li et al. (2010) further proposed a method to separate the shifted and un-shifted text based on training a binary detector. Classification models are then trained based on each of the two parts. An ensemble of two component parts is used at last to get the final polarity of the whole text."]},{"title":"3 The Proposed Approach","paragraphs":["We first present the method for generating artificial polarity-opposite samples, and then introduce the algorithm of dual training and dual prediction (DTDP).","3.1 Generating Artificial Polarity-Opposite Samples Given an original sample and an antonym dictionary (e.g., WordNet 1","), a polarity-opposite","sample is generated artificially according to the","following rules:","1) Sentiment word reversion: All sentiment words out of the scope of negation are reversed to their antonyms;","2) Handling negation: If there is a negation expression, we first detect the scope of negation, and then remove the negation words (e.g., “no”, “not”, and “don’t”). The sentiment words in the scope of negation are not reversed;","3) Label reversion: The class label of the labeled sample is also reversed to its opposite (i.e., Positive to Negative, or vice versa) as the class label of newly generated samples (called polarity-opposite samples). Let us use a simple example to explain the","generation process. Given the original sample: The original sample Text: I don’t like this book. It is boring. Label: Negative","According to Rule 1, “boring” is reversed to its antonym “interesting”; According to Rule 2, the negation word “don’t” is removed, and “like” is not reversed; According to Rule 3, the class label Negative is reversed to Positive. Finally, an artificial polarity-opposite sample is generated: The generated opposite sample Text: I like this book. It is interesting. Label: Positive","All samples in the training and test set are reversed to their polarity-opposite versions. We refer to them as “opposite training set” and “opposite test set”, respectively. 3.2 Dual Training and Dual Prediction In this part, we introduce how to make use of the original and opposite training/test data together for dual training and dual prediction (DTDP).","Dual Training: Let D = f(xi; yi)gN","i=1 and ~D = f(~xi; ~yi)gN","i=1 be the original and opposite training set respectively, where x denotes the feature vector, y denotes the class label, and N denotes the size of training set. In dual training, D [ ~D are used together as training data to learn 1 http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ 522  a classification model. The size of training data is doubled in dual training.","Suppose the example in Section 3.1 is used as one training sample. As far as only the original sample (“I don’t like this book. It is boring.”) is considered, the feature “like” will be improperly recognized as a negative indicator (since the class label is Negative), ignoring the expression of negation. Nevertheless, if the generated opposite sample (“I like this book. It is interesting.”) is also used for training, “like” will be learned correctly, due to the removal of negation in sample reversion. Therefore, the procedure of dual training can correct some learning errors caused by polarity shift.","Dual Prediction: Given an already-trained classification model, in dual prediction, the original and opposite test samples are used together for prediction. In dual prediction, when we predict the positive degree of a test sample, we measure not only how positive the original test sample is, but also how negative the opposite sample is.","Let x and ~x denote the feature vector of the original and opposite test samples respectively; let pd(cjx) and pd(cj~x) denote the predictions of the original and opposite test sample, based on the dual training model. The dual predicting function is defined as: pd(+jx; ~x) = (1 ¡ a)pd(+jx) + apd(¡j~x), pd(¡jx; ~x) = (1 ¡ a)pd(¡jx) + apd(+j~x), where a (0 6 a 6 1) is the weight of the opposite prediction.","Now suppose the example in Section 3.1 is a test sample. As far as only the original test sample (“I don’t like this book. It is boring.”) is used for prediction, it is very likely that it is falsely predicted as Positive, since “like” is a strong positive feature, despite that it is in the scope of negation. While in dual prediction, we still measure the “sentiment-opposite” degree of the opposite test sample (“I like this book. It is interesting.”). Since negation is removed, it is very likely that the opposite test sample is assigned with a high positive score, which could compensate the prediction errors of the original test sample.","Final Output: It should be noted that although the artificially generated training and test-ing data are helpful in most cases, they still produce some noises (e.g., some poorly generated samples may violate the quality of the original data set). Therefore, instead of using all dual predictions as the final output, we use the original prediction po(cjx) as an alternate, in case that the dual prediction pd(cjx; ~x) is not enough confident, according to a confidence threshold t. The final output is defined as: pf (cjx) = 1⁄2 pd(cjx; ~x); if ¢p > t po(cjx); if ¢p < t  where ¢p = pd(cjx; ~x) ¡ po(cjx)."]},{"title":"4 Experimental Study 4.1 Datasets","paragraphs":["The Multi-Domain Sentiment Datasets2","are used for evaluations. They consist of product reviews collected from four different domains: Book, DVD, Electronics and Kitchen. Each of them contains 1,000 positive and 1,000 negative reviews.

From this table, we can see that the performance of each system is improved compared to that using unigrams.
