In particular, we extend the monolingual infinite tree model (Finkel et al., 2007) to a bilingual scenario: each hidden state (POS tag) of a source-side dependency tree emits a source word together with its aligned target word, either jointly (joint model), or independently (independent model). Evaluations of Japanese-to-English translation on the NTCIR-9 data show that our induced Japanese POS tags for dependency trees improve the performance of a forest-to-string SMT system.

However, dependency parsing, which is a popular choice for Japanese, can incorporate only shallow syntactic information, i.e., POS tags, compared with the richer syntactic phrasal categories in constituency parsing. Moreover, existing POS tagsets might not be optimal for SMT because they are constructed without considering the language in the other side. Consider the examples in Figure 1. The Japanese noun “” in 私 が 利用利用利用利用 料金 を 払う あなた は インターネット が 利用利用利用利用 でき ない You can not use the Internet . I pay usage fees . noun particle particlenoun noun verb auxiliary verb noun particle noun noun verbparticle [Example 1] [Example 2] Japanese POS: Japanese POS: Figure 1: Examples of Existing Japanese POS Tags and Dependency Structures Example 1 corresponds to the English verb “use”, while that in Example 2 corresponds to the English noun “usage”. Thus, Japanese nouns act like verbs in English in one situation, and nouns in English in another. If we could discriminate POS tags for two cases, we might improve the performance of a Japanese-to-English SMT system.","In the face of the above situations, this paper proposes an unsupervised method for inducing POS tags for SMT, and aims to improve the performance of syntax-based SMT by utilizing the induced POS tagset. The proposed method is based on the infinite tree model proposed by Finkel et al. (2007), which is a nonparametric Bayesian method for inducing POS tags from syntactic dependency structures. In this model, hidden states represent POS tags, the observations they generate represent the words themselves, and tree structures represent syntactic dependencies between pairs of POS tags.","The proposed method builds on this model by incorporating the aligned words in the other language into the observations. We investigate two types of models: (i) a joint model and (ii) an independent model. In the joint model, each hidden state jointly emits both a source word and its aligned target word as an observation. The independent model separately emits words in two languages from hidden states. By inferring POS 841 tags based on bilingual observations, both models can induce POS tags by incorporating information from the other language. Consider, for example, inducing a POS tag for the Japanese word “ ” in Figure 1. Under a monolingual induction method (e.g., the infinite tree model), the “” in Example 1 and 2 would both be assigned the same POS tag since they share the same observation. However, our models would assign separate tags for the two different instances since the “ ” in Example 1 and Example 2 could be disambiguated by encoding the target-side information, either “use” or “usage”, in the observations.","Inference is efficiently carried out by beam sampling (Gael et al., 2008), which combines slice sampling and dynamic programming. Experiments are carried out on the NTCIR-9 Japanese-to-English task using a binarized forest-to-string SMT system with dependency trees as its source side. Our bilingually-induced tagset significantly outperforms the original tagset and the monolingually-induced tagset. Further, our independent model achieves a more than 1 point gain in BLEU, which resolves the sparseness problem introduced by the bi-word observations."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["A number of unsupervised methods have been proposed for inducing POS tags.

Let Tt denote the tree whose root node is t. A node t has a hidden state zt (the POS tag) and an observation xt (the word). The probability of a tree Tt, pT (Tt), is recursively defined: pT (Tt) = p(xt|zt) ∏ t′ ∈c(t) p(zt′ |zt)pT (Tt′), where c(t) is the set of the children of t.","Let each hidden state variable have C possible values indexed by k.

Specifically, the proposed model introduces bilingual observations by embedding the aligned target words in the source-side dependency trees. This paper proposes two types of models that differ in their processes for generating observations: the joint model and the independent model. 3.1 Joint Model The joint model is a simple application of the infinite tree model under a bilingual scenario. The model is formally defined in the same way as in Section 2.2 and is graphically represented similarly to Figure 3. The only difference from the infinite tree model is the instances of observations (xt). Observations in the joint model are the combination of source words and their aligned target words4",", while observations in the monolingual infinite tree model represent only source words. For each source word, all the aligned target words are copied and sorted in alphabetical order, and then concatenated into a single observation. Therefore, a single target word may be emitted multiple times if the target word is aligned with multiple source words. Likewise, there may be target words which may not be emitted by our model, if the target words are not aligned.","Figure 4 shows the process of generating Example 2 in Figure 1 through the joint model, where aligned words are jointly emitted as observations.

Similarly, the POS tag of “” in Example 1 would generate the string “+use”. Hence, this model can assign different POS tags to the two different instances of the word “”, based on the different observation distributions in inference. 3.2 Independent Model The joint model is prone to a data sparseness problem, since each observation is a combination of a source word and its aligned target word. Thus, we propose an independent model, where each hidden state generates a source word and its aligned target word separately. For the aligned target side, we introduce an observation variable x′","t for each zt and a parameter φ′","k for each state k, which parameterizes a distinct distribution over the observations x′ t for that state. φ′","k is distributed according to a prior distribution H′",". Specifically, the independent model is formally defined as follows: β|γ ∼ GEM(γ),","πk|α0, β ∼ DP(α0, β),","φk ∼ H, φ′","k ∼ H′",",","zt′|zt ∼ Multinomial(πzt),","xt|zt ∼ F (φzt), x′ t|zt ∼ F ′","(φ′","zt). When multiple target words are aligned to a single source word, each aligned word is generated separately from observation distribution parameterized by φ′","k.","Figure 5 graphs the process of generating Example 2 in Figure 1 using the independent model. x′ t and φ′","k are introduced for aligned target words. The state of “” (z5) generates the Japanese word “” as x5 and the English word “usage” as x′","5. Due to this factorization, the independent model is less subject to the sparseness problem. 3.3 Introduction of Other Factors We assumed the surface form of aligned target words as additional observations in previous sec-tions. Here, we introduce additional factors, i.e., the POS of aligned target words, in the observations. Note that POSs of target words are assigned by a POS tagger in the target language and are not inferred in the proposed model.","First, we can simply replace surface forms of target words with their POSs to overcome the sparseness problem. Second, we can incorporate both information from the target language as observations. In the joint model, two pieces of information are concatenated into a single observation. In the independent model, we introduce observation variables (e.g., x′","t and x′′","t ) and parame-","ters (e.g., φ′ k and φ′′","k) for each information. Specifically, x′","t and φ′","k are introduced for the surface form of aligned words, and x′′","t and φ′′","k for the POS of aligned words. Consider, for example, Example 1 in Figure 1. The POS tag of “” generates the string “+use+verb” as the observation in the joint model, while it generates “”, “use”, and “verb” independently in the independent model. 3.4 POS Refinement We have assumed a completely unsupervised way of inducing POS tags in dependency trees. An-other realistic scenario is to refine the existing POS tags (Finkel et al., 2007; Liang et al., 2007) so that each refined sub-POS tag may reflect the information from the aligned words while preserving the handcrafted distinction from original POS tagset. Major difference is that we introduce separate transition probabilities πs","k and observation","distributions (φs k, φ","′","s","k ) for each existing POS tag s. Then, each node t is constrained to follow the distributions indicated by the initially assigned POS tag st, and we use the pair (st, zt) as a state representation. 3.5 Inference In inference, we find the state set that maximizes the posterior probability of state transitions given observations (i.e., P (z1:n|x1:n)). However, we cannot evaluate the probability for all possible states because the number of states is infinite. Finkel et al. (2007) presented a sampling algorithm for the infinite tree model, which is based on the Gibbs sampling in the direct assignment representation for iHMM (Teh et al., 2006). In the 844 Gibbs sampling, individual hidden state variables are resampled conditioned on all other variables. Unfortunately, its convergence is slow in HMM settings because sequential data is likely to have a strong correlation between hidden states (Gael et al., 2008).","We present an inference procedure based on beam sampling (Gael et al., 2008) for the joint model and the independent model. Beam sampling limits the number of possible state transitions for each node to a finite number using slice sampling (Neal, 2003), and then efficiently samples whole hidden state transitions using dynamic programming. Beam sampling does not suffer from slow convergence as in Gibbs sampling by sampling the whole state variables at once. In addition, Gael et al. (2008) showed that beam sampling is more robust to initialization and hyperparameter choice than Gibbs sampling.","Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary variable ut for each node in a dependency tree to limit the number of possible transitions. Our procedure alternates between sampling each of the following variables: the auxiliary variables u, the state assignments z, the transition probabilities π, the shared DP parameters β, and the hyperparameters α0 and γ. We can parallelize procedures in sampling u and z because the slice sampling for u and the dynamic programing for z are independent for each sentence. See Gael el al. (2009) for details.","The only difference between inferences in the joint model and the independent model is in computing the posterior probability of state transitions given observations (e.g., p(z1:n|x1:n) and p(z1:n|x1:n, x′","1:n)) in sampling z. In the following, we describe each sampling stage. See Teh et al., (2006) for details of sampling π, β, α0 and γ. Sampling u: Each ut is sampled from the uniform distribution on [0, πzd(t)zt], where d(t) is the parent of t: ut ∼ Uniform(0, πzd(t)zt). Note that ut is a positive number, since each transition probability πzd(t)zt is larger than zero. Sampling z: Possible values k of zt are divided into the two sets using ut: a finite set with πzd(t)k > ut and an infinite set with πzd(t)k ≤ ut. The beam sampling considers only the former set. Owing to the truncation of the latter set, we can compute the posterior probability of a state zt given observations for all t (t = 1, . . . , T ) using dynamic programming as follows: In the joint model, p(zt|xσ(t), uσ(t)) ∝ p(xt|zt) · ∑","zd(t):πz d(t)z","t>ut p(zd(t)|xσ(d(t)), uσ(d(t))),","and in the independent model,","p(zt|xσ(t), x′","σ(t), uσ(t)) ∝ p(xt|zt) · p(x′","t|zt) · ∑","zd(t):πz d(t)z","t>ut","p(zd(t)|xσ(d(t)), x′ σ(d(t)), uσ(d(t))), where xσ(t) (or uσ(t)) denotes the set of xt (or ut) on the path from the root node to the node t in a tree.","In our experiments, we assume that F (φk) is Multinomial(φk) and H is Dirichlet(ρ, . . . , ρ), which is the same in Finkel et al. (2007). Under this assumption, the posterior probability of an observation is as follows: p(xt|zt) = ṅxtk + ρ ṅ·k + N ρ , where ṅxk is the number of observations x with state k, ṅ·k is the number of hidden states whose values are k, and N is the total number of observations x. Similarly, p(x′","t|zt) =","ṅx′","tk + ρ′","ṅ·k + N ′","ρ′ , where N ′","is the total number of observations x′",". When the posterior probability of a state zt given observations for all t can be computed, we first sample the state of each leaf node and then perform backtrack sampling for every other zt where the zt is sampled given the sample for zc(t) as follows: p(zt|zc(t), x1:T , u1:T ) ∝ p(zt|xσ(t), uσ(t))","∏ t′ ∈c(t) p(zt′ |zt, ut′). Sampling π: We introduce a count variable nij ∈ n, which is the number of observations with state j whose parent’s state is i.

Sampling β: We introduce a set of auxiliary variables m, where mij ∈ m is the number of elements of πj corresponding to βi.

In the training process, the following steps are performed sequentially: preprocessing, inducing a POS tagset for a source language, training a POS tagger and a dependency parser, and training a forest-to-string MT model. Step 1. Preprocessing We used the first 10,000 Japanese-English sentence pairs in the NTCIR-9 training data for inducing a POS tagset for Japanese6",". The Japanese sentences were segmented using MeCab7",", and the English sentences were tokenized and POS tagged using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994), where 43 and 58 types of POS tags are included in the Japanese sentences and the English sentences, respectively. The Japanese POS tags come from the second-level POS tags in the IPA POS tagset (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2003) and the English POS tags are derived from the Penn Treebank. Note that the Japanese POS tags are used for initialization of hidden states and the English POS tags are used as observations emitted by hidden states.","Word-by-word alignments for the sentence pairs are produced by first running GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) in both directions and then combining the alignments using the “grow-diag-final-and” heuristic (Koehn et al., 2003).

We also performed monolingual induction of Finkel et al. (2007) for comparison (M ono). In each model, a sequence of sampling u, z, π, β, α0, and γ is repeated 10,000 times. In sampling α0 and γ, hyperparameters αa, αb, γa, and γb are set to 2, 1, 1, and 1, respectively, which is the same setting in Gael et al. (2008). In sampling z, parameters ρ, ρ′",", . . ., are set to 0.01. In the experiments, three types of factors for the aligned English words are compared: surface forms (‘s’), POS tags (‘P’), and the combination of both (‘s+P’). Further, two types of inference frameworks are compared: induction (IN D) and ref inement (REF ). In both frameworks, each hidden state zt is first initialized to the POS tags assigned by MeCab (the IPA POS tagset), and then each state is updated through the inference procedure described in Section 3.5. Note that in REF , the sampling distribution over zt is constrained to include only states that are a refinement of the initially assigned POS tag. Step 3. Training a POS Tagger and a Dependency Parser In this step, we train a Japanese dependency parser from the 10,000 Japanese dependency trees with the induced POS tags which are derived from Step 2. We employed a transition-based dependency parser which can jointly learn POS tagging and dependency parsing (Hatori et al., 2011) under an incremental framework11",". Note that the learned parser can identify dependencies between words and attach an induced POS tag for each word. Step 4. Training a Forest-to-String MT In this step, we train a forest-to-string MT model based on the learned dependency parser in Step 3.

All the Japanese and English sentences in the NTCIR-9 training data are segmented in the same way as in Step 1, and then each Japanese sentence is parsed by the dependency parser learned in Step 3, which simultaneously assigns induced POS tags and word dependencies.

Additionally, all the systems using the independent model outperform BS. The improvements are statistically significant in the bootstrap method (Koehn, 2004), with a 1% significance level. The results show that the proposed models can generate more favorable POS tagsets for SMT than an existing POS tagset.","In Table 1, REF s are at least comparable to, or better than, IN Ds except for M ono. This shows that REF achieves better performance by preserving the clues from the original POS tagset. However, REF may suffer sever overfitting problem for M ono since no bilingual information was in-corporated. Further, when the full-level IPA POS tags12","were used in BS, the system achieved a 27.49% BLEU score, which is worse than the result using the second-level IPA POS tags. This means that manual refinement without bilingual information may also cause an overfitting problem in MT."]},{"title":"5 Discussion 5.1 Comparison to the IPA POS Tagset","paragraphs":["Table 2 shows the number of the IPA POS tags used in the experiments and the POS tags induced by the proposed models. This table shows that each induced tagset contains more POS tags than the IPA POS tagset. In the experimental data, some of Japanese verbs correspond to genuine English verbs, some are nominalized, and others correspond to English past participle verbs or present participle verbs which modify other words. Respective examples are “I use a card.”, “U sing the index is faster.”, and “I explain using an example.”, where all the underlined words correspond to the same Japanese word, “”, whose IPA POS tag is a verb. Ind[s+P] in REF generated the POS tagset where the three types are assigned to separate POS groups.","The Japanese particle “” is sometimes attached to nouns to give them adverb roles. For","12","377 types of full-level IPA POS tags were included in our experimental data.","Tagging Dependency","IN D REF IN D REF Original 90.37 93.62 M ono 90.75 88.04 91.77 91.51 J oint[s] 89.08 86.73 91.55 91.14 J oint[P] 80.54 79.98 91.06 91.29 J oint[s+P] 87.56 84.92 91.31 91.10 Ind[s] 87.62 84.33 92.06 92.58 Ind[P] 90.21 88.50 92.85 93.03 Ind[s+P] 89.57 86.12 92.96 92.78 Table 3: Tagging and Dependency Accuracy (%) example, “ (mutual) ” is translated as the adverb “mutually” in English. Other times, it is attached to words to make them the objects of verbs. For example, “ (he) (give)” is translated as “give him”. The POS tags by Ind[s+P] in REF discriminated the two types.","These examples show that the proposed models can disambiguate POS tags that have different functions in English, whereas the IPA POS tagset treats them jointly. Thus, such discrimination improves the performance of a forest-to-string SMT.","5.2 Impact of Tagging and Dependency Accuracy The performance of our methods depends not only on the quality of the induced tag sets but also on the performance of the dependency parser learned in Step 3 of Section 4.1. We cannot directly evaluate the tagging accuracy of the parser trained through Step 3 because we do not have any data with induced POS tags other than the 10,000-sentence data gained through Step 2. Thus we split the 10,000 data into the first 9,000 data for training and the remaining 1,000 for testing, and then a dependency parser was learned in the same way as in Step 3.","Table 3 shows the results. Original is the performance of the parser learned from the training data with the original POS tagset. Note that the dependency accuracies are measured on the automatically parsed dependency trees, not on the syntactically correct gold standard trees. Thus Original achieved the best dependency accuracy.","In Table 3, the performance for our bilingually-induced POSs, J oint and Ind, are lower than Original and M ono. It seems performing parsing and tagging with the bilingually-induced POS tagset is too difficult when only monolingual in-848 formation is available to the parser. However, our bilingually-induced POSs, except for J oint[P ], with the lower accuracies are more effective for SMT than the monolingually-induced POSs and the original POSs, as indicated in Table 1. The tagging accuracies for J oint[P ] both in IN D and REF are significantly lower than the others, while the dependency accuracies do not differ significantly. The lower tagging accuracies may directly reflect the lower translation qualities for J oint[P ] in Table 1."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We proposed a novel method for inducing POS tags for SMT. The proposed method is a nonparametric Bayesian method, which infers hidden states (i.e., POS tags) based on observations representing not only source words themselves but also aligned target words. Our experiments showed that a more favorable POS tagset can be induced by integrating aligned information, and further-more, the POS tagset generated by the proposed method is more effective for SMT than an existing POS tagset (the IPA POS tagset).","Even though we employed word alignment from GIZA++ with potential errors, large gains were achieved using our proposed method. We would like to investigate the influence of alignment errors in the future. In addition, we are planning to prove the effectiveness of our proposed method for language pairs other than Japanese-to-English. We are also planning to introduce our proposed method to other syntax-based SMT, such as a string-to-tree SMT and a tree-to-tree SMT."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank Isao Goto for helpful discussions and anonymous reviewers for valuable comments.
