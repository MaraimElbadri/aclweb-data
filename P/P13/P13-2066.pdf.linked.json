In this paper, we propose a novel translation framework with the help of RST. In our framework, the translation process mainly includes three steps: 1) Source RST-tree acquisition: a source sentence is parsed into an RST tree; 2) Rule extraction: translation rules are extracted from the source tree and the target string via bilingual word alignment; 3) RST-based translation: the source RST-tree is translated with translation rules. Experiments on Chinese-to-English show that our RST-based approach achieves improvements of 2.3/0.77/1.43 BLEU points on NIST04/NIST05/CWMT2008 respectively."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["For statistical machine translation (SMT), a crucial issue is how to build a translation model to extract as much accurate and generative translation knowledge as possible. The existing SMT models have made much progress. However, they still suffer from the bad performance of unnatural or even unreadable translation, especially when the sentences become complicated. We think the deep reason is that those models only extract translation information on lexical or syntactic level, but fail to give an overall under-standing of source sentences on semantic level of discourse. In order to solve such problem, (Gong et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2011; Wong and Kit, 2012) build discourse-based translation models to ensure the lexical coherence or consistency. Although some lexicons can be translated better by their models, the overall structure still re-mains unnatural. Marcu et al. (2000) design a discourse structure transferring module, but leave much work to do, especially on how to integrate this module into SMT and how to automatically analyze the structures. Those reasons urge us to seek a new translation framework under the idea of “translation with overall understanding”.","Rhetorical structure theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) provides us with a good perspective and inspiration to build such a framework. Generally, an RST tree can explicitly show the minimal spans with semantic functional integrity, which are called elementary discourse units (edus) (Marcu et al., 2000), and it also de-picts the hierarchical relations among edus. Furthermore, since different languages’ edus are usually equivalent on semantic level, it is intuitive to create a new framework based on RST by directly mapping the source edus to target ones.","Taking the Chinese-to-English translation as an example, our translation framework works as the following steps:","1) Source RST-tree acquisition: a source sentence is parsed into an RST-tree;","2) Rule extraction: translation rules are extracted from the source tree and the target string via bilingual word alignment;","3) RST-based translation: the source RST-tree is translated into target sentence with extracted translation rules.","Experiments on Chinese-to-English sentence-level discourses demonstrate that this method achieves significant improvements. 2"]},{"title":"Chinese RST Parser 2.1 Annotation of Chinese RST Tree","paragraphs":["Similar to (Soricut and Marcu, 2003), a node of RST tree is represented as a tuple R-[s, m, e], which means the relation R controls two semantic spans U1 and U2 , U1 starts from word position s and stops at word position m. U2 starts from m+1 and ends with e. Under the guidance of definition of RST, Yue (2008) defined 12 groups1","of 1 They are Parallel, Alternative, Condition, Reason, Elaboration, Means, Preparation, Enablement, Antithesis, Background, Evidences, Others. 370 rhetorical relations for Chinese particularly, upon which our Chinese RST parser is developed.","Figure 1 illustrates an example of Chinese RST tree and its alignment to the English string. There are two levels in this tree. The Antithesis relation controls U1 from 0 to 9 and U2 from 10 to 21. Thus it is written as Antithesis-[0,9,21]. Different shadow blocks denote the alignments of different edus. Links between source and target words are alignments of cue words. Cue words are viewed as the strongest clues for rhetorical relation recognition and always found at the beginning of text (Reitter, 2003), such as “即 使(although), 由于(because of)”. With the cue words included, the relations are much easier to be analyzed. So we focus on the explicit relations with cue words in this paper as our first try. 2.2 Bayesian Method for Chinese RST Parser For Chinese RST parser, there are two tasks. One is the segmentation of edu and the other is the relation tagging between two semantic spans. Feature Meaning F1(F6) left(right) child is a syntactic sub-tree? F2(F5) left(right) child ends with a punctuation? F3(F4) cue words of left (right) child. F7 left and right children are sibling nodes? F8(F9) syntactic head symbol of left(right) child. Table 1: 9 features used in our Bayesian model","Inspired by the features used in English RST parser (Soricut and Marcu, 2003; Reitter, 2003; Duverle and Prendinger, 2009; Hernault et al., 2010a), we design a Bayesian model to build a joint parser for segmentation and tagging simultaneously. In this model, 9 features in Table 1 are used. In the table, punctuations include comma, semicolons, period and question mark. We view explicit connectives as cue words in this paper.","Figure 2 illustrates the conditional independences of 9 features which are denoted with F1~F9.","","The segmentation and parsing conditional","probabilities are computed as follows:","P (mjF 9","1 ) = P (mjF 3","1 ; F8) (1)","P (ejF 9 1 ) = P (ejF 7","4 ; F9) (2)","P (ReljF 9","1 ) = P (ReljF 4","3 ) (3) where Fn represents the nth","feature , F l","n means features from n to l. Rel is short for relation. (1) and (2) describe the conditional probabilities of m and e. When using Formula (3) to predict the relation, we search all the cue-words pair, as shown in Figure 1, to get the best match. When training, we use maximum likelihood estimation to get all the associated probabilities.

A complete RST tree constructs until the end of the iterative process for this sentence. This method can run fast due to the simple greedy algorithm. It is plausible in our cases, because we only have a small scale of manually-annotated Chinese RST corpus, which prefers simple rather than complicated models."]},{"title":"3 Translation Model 3.1 Rule Extraction","paragraphs":["As shown in Figure 1, the RST tree-to-string alignment provides us with two types of translation rules. One is common phrase-based rules, which are just like those in phrase-based model (Koehn et al., 2003). The other is RST tree-to-string rule, and it’s defined as, relation ::U1(®; X)=U2(°; Y )",") U1(tr(®); tr(X)) » U2(tr(°); tr(Y )) where the terminal characters α and γ represent the cue words which are optimum match for maximizing Formula (3). While the nonterminals X and Y represent the rest of the sequence. Function tr( · ) means the translation of ·. The operator ~ is an operator to indicate that the order of tr(U1) and tr(U2) is monotone or reverse. During rules’ extraction, if the mean position of all the words in tr(U1) precedes that in tr(U2), ~ is monotone. Otherwise, ~ is reverse.","For example in Figure 1, the Reason relation controls U1:[10,13] and U2:[14,21]. Because the mean position of tr(U2) is before that of tr(U1), the reverse order is selected. We list the RST-based rules for Example 1 in Figure 1. 3.2 Probabilities Estimation For the phrase-based translation rules, we use four common probabilities and the probabilities’ estimation is the same with those in (Koehn et al., 2003). While the probabilities of RST-based translation rules are given as follows, (1) P(rejrf ; Rel) =","Count(re;rf;relation)","Count(rf;relation) : where re is the target side of the rule, ignorance of the order, i.e. U1(tr(®); tr(X)) » U2(tr(°); tr(Y )) with two directions, rf is the source side, i.e. U1(®; X)=U2(°; Y ), and Rel means the relation type.

This global optimization problem is approximately simplified to local optimization to reduce the complexity,","Y fn2ft argmaxenfP (eu1; eu2; ¿jfn)g","In our paper, we have the following two ways to factorize the above formula, Decoder 1: P (eu1; eu2; ¿ jfn) = P (ecp; eX ; eY ; ¿ jfcp; fX ; fY ) = P (ecpjfcp)P (¿jecp; fcp)P (eX jfX )P (eY jfY ) = P (rejrf ; Rel)P (¿ jre; rf ; Rel)P (eX jfX )P (eY jfY ) where eX, eY are the translation of non-terminal parts. fcp and ecp are cue-words pair of source and target sides.

Their translations are then re-packaged by the rule of Reason- [10,13,21]. Iteratively, the translations of span [1,9] and [10,21] are re-packaged by the rule of Antithesis-[0,9,21] to form the final translation. 372 Decoder 2 : Suppose that the translating process of two spans U1 and U2 are independent of each other, we rewrite P (eu1; eu2; ¿jfn) as follows, P (eu1; eu2; ¿ jfn) = P (eu1; eu2; ¿ jfu1; fu2) = P (eu1jfu1)P (eu2jfu2)P (¿ jrf ; Rel) = P (eu1jfu1)P (eu2jfu2) X re P (¿ jre; rf ; Rel)P (rejrf ; Rel) after approximately simplified to local optimization, the final formulae are re-written as below, ","argmaxe u1 fP r(eu1jfu1)g (7)","argmaxe u2 fP r(eu2jfu2)g (8) argmaxrfX e P r(¿jre; rf ; Rel)P r(rejrf ; Rel)g (9)","We also adopt the bottom-up manner similar to Decoder 1. In Figure 1, U1 and U2 of Reason node are firstly translated. Their translations are then re-ordered. Then the translations of two spans of Antithesis node are re-ordered and constructed into the final translation. In Decoder 2, the minimal translation-unit is edu. While in Decoder 1, an edu is further split into cue-word part and the rest part to obtain the respective translation.","In our decoders, language model(LM) is used for translating edus in Formula(5),(6),(7),(8), but not for reordering the upper spans because with the bottom-to-up combination, the spans become longer and harder to be judged by a traditional language model. So we only use RST rules to guide the reordering. But LM will be properly considered in our future work."]},{"title":"5 Experiment 5.1 Setup","paragraphs":["In order to do Chinese RST parser, we annotated over 1,000 complicated sentences on CTB (Xue et al., 2005), among which 1,107 sentences are used for training, and 500 sentences are used for testing.

On average, our RS trees are 2 layers deep. The parsing errors mostly result from the segmentation errors, which are mainly caused by syntactic parsing errors. On the other hand, the polysemous cue words, such as “而(but, and, thus)” may lead ambiguity for relation recognition, because they can be clues for different relations.
