Chen University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill School of Information and Library Science atchen@email.unc.edu   Abstract","paragraphs":["Though there has been substantial research concerning the extraction of information from clinical notes, to date there has been less work concerning the extraction of useful information from patient-generated content. Using a dataset comprised of online support group discussion content, this paper investigates two dimensions that may be important in the extraction of patient-generated experiences from text; significant individuals/groups and medication use. With regard to the former, the paper describes an approach involving the pairing of important figures (e.g. family, husbands, doctors, etc.) and affect, and suggests possible applications of such techniques to research concerning online social support, as well as integration into search interfaces for patients. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the extraction of side effects and sentiment at different phases in patient medication use, e.g. adoption, current use, discontinuation and switching, and demonstrates the utility of such an application for drug safety monitoring in online discussion forums."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Online support groups are a rich source of information concerning patient experiences, but they are far different from clinical content. Instead of “The patient presents with...” and “denies vomit-ing,” patients may speak of their “doc” and “rheumy.” There may be utterances like “LOL” (laugh out loud) and “Hugs.” Patients may raise issues that they may be reticent to speak with health care practitioners about, day-to-day condition management issues, or personal strategies that they have for taking medicine. In recent years, it has been observed that patients may be a valuable source of expertise to other patients, and that they provide information that is different from the expertise of clinicians (Civan & Pratt, 2007; Hartzler & Pratt, 2011). This may include: action strategies, recommended knowledge, suggested approaches, and information resources for dealing with problems. This content can be extremely valuable to clinicians and patients alike; however, to date most interfaces for patient-generated content offer few features tailored to the unique nature of the content in these support forums.","Thus, the objective of the current paper was to explore techniques for extracting and visualizing dimensions of patient experience. For this preliminary work, two specific dimensions were selected: interpersonal interactions and medication use.","Interpersonal interactions are an important dimension to consider because others have such a profound impact on patient experience. For example, social support from family, friends and even practitioners can be invaluable to patients; and understanding, (or the lack of it), from practitioners and other people in one’s life can be enormously difficult for people, especially those dealing with a stigmatized condition such as fibromyalgia (Barker, 2008). Thus, automatic identification of patient experiences with others, e.g. family, husband, wife, son, daughter, doctor, etc., and ways of highlighting similar types of experiences across patients, might serve various uses. Scientists could use this to study social support, physician-patient communication and other types of interpersonal interactions. Integrated into a search interface, patients could search for others with similar experiences, and see if there are strategies that they could use to address their own problem.","Medication use is another important dimen-sion of patient experience. There has also been an increased interest in the use of online discussion content to predict adverse events and moni-tor off-label prescription practices (e.g. Wang et al., 2011; Leaman et al., 2010; Chee et al., 2011). This work differs from previous literature in that the method identifies and visually contextualizes patient medication experiences, particularly in terms of stages of use and affect. 16"]},{"title":"2 Background","paragraphs":["This work draws primarily upon two streams of literature: automated analyses of health-related discussion content, and extraction of medication-related information from text. With regard to the former, a large number of studies have employed the software, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), to compare emotional expression in communities or associations between emotional expression and health outcomes (e.g. Siriaraya et al., 2011; Han et al., 2008). Other studies of online support groups have focused on social support. Wang, Kraut and Levine (2012) used machine learning with features generated using LIWC and Latent Dirichlet Allocation to investigate whether different types and amounts of social support are associated with length of membership. Namkoong et al. (2010) examined the effects of exchanging treatment information within computer-mediated breast cancer support groups on emotional well-being. Treatment information exchange was as-sessed using InfoTrend, a software program that employs a rule-based system for computer-aided coding of key ideas. The task of extraction of medication-related information has often been explored in past literature. For example, the 2009 i2b2 medication challenge focused on the extraction of medication-related information from discharge summaries including: medication name, dosage, mode, frequency, duration and reason (Spasic et al., 2010). This study differs from previous work in that, the focus is not on the time of day or the frequency of medication use, but rather, the stage in the adoption/discontinuation of a medication an individual is at."]},{"title":"3 Method","paragraphs":["Discussion content was downloaded through a series of focused crawls of a health-related social networking site (SNS), DailyStrength (http://www.dailystrength.org). The content from the corpus encompasses a span of time of approximately 3.5 years, from the site’s inception in 2006, to early 2010. Text pre-processing was done to strip code and extract post metadata. The text was parsed and tagged using the Stanford Parts-of-Speech Tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003). An affective lexicon, WordNet-Affect was used to identify words with emotional content in the text (Strapparava & Valitutti, 2004). There are many specialized resources that could be used to extract medical terminology. However, forum participants wrote in ways that often departed from medical terminology; thus, it was decided that manually constructed lexicons of medication names, side effects and people would be more effective."]},{"title":"4 Results","paragraphs":["The results are reported in three parts: descriptive statistics for the corpus, interaction with others and medication information. 4.1 Corpus The corpus is comprised of discussion posts for three conditions. Since the first part of this study examines interpersonal interactions, three conditions were selected in which key support interactions and level of affect were expected to differ.","","Unit/Con","dition Breast cancer Type 1 diabetes","Fibrom-","yalgia Threads 614 514 763 Posts 2,847 3,259 6,095 Tokens 366,121 389,392 541,233 Types 18,181 18,755 25,942  Table 1: Corpus Statistics 4.2 Modeling Interpersonal Interactions This work first addresses the challenge of modeling interpersonal interactions. There are two methods of visualization that are explored: the coupling of people and affect, and that of people and actions.","The first step in the pairing of people and affect, was to identify and estimate rates of occurrence of important figures appearing in the text such as: family, husband, wife, mother, friend, and doctor. In order to extract these relations, the researcher manually compiled a list of terms indicating such relations through review of social support literature pertaining to the focal conditions and manual analysis of the text. Alternative names such as “hubby” for husband, “doc” and “dr” for doctor, and “rheumy” for rheumatologist, were included. Many of the instances of the word “family” appeared were references to family doctors or family history; these references were excluded from the estimates (Table 2).","These results show that certain types of individuals tend to appear in forum conversations for certain conditions over others: mothers, family and friends in breast cancer; sons, daughters, and “people” in Type 1 diabetes; and doctors in fi-17 bromyalgia. As can be seen, many posts do not include references to other people, but rather, focus on other areas such as patients’ own experiences.","","Term Breast cancer","Diabetes Fibromyal-","gia Family 5.09 3.95 1.75 Husband 4.03 3.4 3.02 Wife 0.57 0.92 0.41 Mother 8.62 3.86 1.54 Son 1 3.86 0.61 Daughter 2.23 4.8 1 Friend 3.13 2.23 1.85 Doctor 13.28 13.49 16.42 People 8.42 13.37 8.96"," Table 2: Percent of Posts Mentioning Important Roles","","Next, the degree of affect expressed in proximity with these roles was investigated. Various sentiment lexicons are available, e.g. SentiWordNet, WordNet-Affect and the LIWC lexicon. Many lexicons classify words as positive or negative or by a limited set of emotions; however, with complex issues like health and interpersonal interactions, there may be multiple dimensions. WordNet-Affect was selected for its diverse set of emotion categories. Following a review of emotion research and preliminary content analysis of the corpus, seven emotions were selected on the basis of frequency and relevance to the conditions (Table 3)."," Emotion Example Anger I'm happy but also mad cuz I've","been suffering and no doctor both-","ered to tell me about this. Fear I have the prescription right here","and afraid to try it. Frustration It is extremely discouraging to","hear that repeatedly... Sadness It's sad that I am so excited about","getting some sleep. Anxiety You may be worrying over noth-","ing. Happiness I'm so happy Lyrica is working for","you. Hope I really hope this works for you."," Table 3: Examples of Emotional Expression ","The percentage of posts expressing various affect types was calculated (Table 4). Across all conditions, fear and hope were most common. The highest proportion of fear, happiness and hope were seen in the breast cancer forum. Though anger and frustration were not as common as other emotions, higher levels of these emotions in diabetes are perhaps worthy of note.","","Emotion Breast","cancer","Diabetes Fibromyal-","gia Hope 15.55 12.2 13.36 Anger 1.5 2.82 1.38","Frustration 0.78 3.49 1.75 Fear 16.05 11.11 6.32","Happiness 10.31 6.41 5.98 Sadness 10.26 9.91 8.21 Anxiety 9.85 8.29 4.81","","Table 4: Percentage of Posts Expressing Emotions","","Radar graphs illustrating the extent of emotional expression for the various roles were generated to facilitate comparison (Fig. 1). The light blue line, representing “doctor,” is the innermost ring in all cases, demonstrating that emotional expression occurs least often in posts that mention doctors. Posts mentioning family (dark blue lines) were generally associated with higher degrees of emotional expression. Moreover, it is interesting that the patterns of emotional expression are quite different across conditions.","This paper also explores the visualization of discussion content by combining important figures and their actions. For this preliminary work, this action was undertaken with the fibromyalgia forum. The approach taken here was to extract high frequency verbs co-occurring in the same sentence with the target role. High frequency verbs that co-occurred with “doctor” included: “said,” “told,” “gave,” “prescribed,” “started,” and “diagnosed.” The verb “asked” also occurred frequently because forum participants often discussed or suggested questions to ask of doctors. Arranging person-verb pairings together in an interface could be a convenient way to acquire a sense of what patients are being told, and what medications doctors are prescribing. One might even add additional search constraints. For example, with regard to patient experiences with doctors prescribing Lyrica, the system might retrieve: “Recently my doctor put me on Lyrica which did help but had me...,” “My doctor gave me a ‘taper down’ schedule,” “My doctor prescribed Lyrica which I refused to take.” Patients could use such a system to acquire a sense of the range of experiences that others have had with the drug. 18    Figure 1: Percent of Posts Containing Affect for Breast Cancer (left), Diabetes (center), and Fibromyalgia (right)   4.3 Modeling Medication Use Extant literature has found that though some categories of discussion content, e.g. selfintroductions, research results and study in-vites, are common across conditions, other types of discussion content differ, e.g., breast cancer discussion more commonly focuses on treatments, and fibromyalgia discussions tend to focus more on medications (Chen, 2012). Thus, in this study, the researcher selected fibromyalgia as a case study for modeling discussion or comments about medication use.","The researcher created a lexicon of drug names for use in this study, drawn from a review of fibromyalgia literature and information resources, as well as manual review of corpus content. The most common medications are listed in Table 3.","","Medication Name # Posts % Posts","Lyrica 670 11.36","Cymbalta 329 5.58","Savella 215 3.65","Neurontin 175 2.97","Tramadol 137 2.32","Ultram 79 1.34"," Table 5: Common Medications","","In order to model temporal differences in patient experience with medications, this study implemented a rule-based system for extraction at five phases in the adoption and use of a medication: adoption, current use, transition, switching, and discontinuation (Table 4). Adoption referred to when an individual began taking a medication. Current use referred to the period in which a person is taking a medication, and has no plans (that he or she reveals at least) to discontinue it. If an individual said that they first had a certain kind of experience with a medication, but that later on it changed, this was referred to as “transition.” Discontinuation referred to when an individual stopped using one medication, and switching to when an individual changed from using one medication to another. Information such as whether side effects were temporary, withdrawal symptoms and interactions/contraindications was also extracted. These rules were implemented at the sentence level to prevent misattributions of side effects when multiple medications are mentioned in the same post.","","Phase Rule","Start “start”, “began”","Current Use “I take”, “is working”,","“currently”, “been on”","etc.","Transition (A & B) A: “initially”, “at first”,","“in the beginning”","B: “after”, “but”, “then”","Switching Fulfills both start and","stop criterion or con-","tains “switch”.","Discontinuation “stop”, “off” or “quit”"," Table 6: Medication Phase Extraction Rules ","Using an interface designed for this study, the researcher investigated the reporting of side effects during each phase. Though the most common side effects for a drug were generally reported in multiple phases, certain side effects were reported in a given phase but not another. The last column, “no stage,” depicts posts that did not contain explicit references to a specific phase of medication use. 19 ","","Figure 2: Mentions of Side Effects for Lyrica, Distinguished by Phase ","Figure 2 shows that, for Lyrica, the predominant symptom that was reported by patients was weight gain, which appeared in almost all phases. Those who took Savella reported symptoms such as nausea, high blood pressure and dizziness, but there were also a number of reports that these disappear over time (Fig. 3).  ","","Figure 3: Mentions of Side Effects for Savella, Distinguished by Phase ","Another important aspect of patients’ experience with certain medications is their attitude towards it. In the previous section, the focus was on emotions because they are important for understanding interpersonal interaction. In the case of medications, rather than tracking the appearance of emotion, it may be useful to consider positive/negative polarity, whether the medication works or not, and side effects.","Thus, in addition to side effects, sentences with positive and negative sentiment were extracted using WordNet-Affect. Words from the “happiness” and “hope” categories of Word-Net Affect were used for positive sentiment, and the “fear,” “anger” and “sadness” categories of WordNet-Affect were used for negative sentiment. A lexicon constructed by examining the corpus supplemented the words from WordNet-Affect.","A rule-based system was implemented to identify instances in which participants mentioned whether a medication worked or not. This was implemented using keywords such as “effective,” “work” or “help,” and recognizing negation. Table 7 lists the number of sentiment and perceptions of efficacy mentions. These do not add up to the number of medication mentions, as many times when medications appear, sentiment is neutral or ambiguous, and perception of efficacy is not the topic of the post. For example, the text might say, “The doctor started me on Savella yesterday.”","These results illustrate the utility of extracting multiple facets of patient medication experience, e.g. positive/negative valence, efficacy and side effects, in order to better understand these experiences. Of particular note in these findings are that the estimates of one dimen-sion may appear to conflict with another. For example, overall sentiment towards many medications is negative, but they are reported as working more often than not. The side effects tell yet another story; in many cases, the side effects are different in different phases. Reading the content, one comes to understand that, in an overwhelming number of cases, it is not that patients have found medications that solve all their problems, but that they are selecting ones that work and weighing the costs of the side effects. Thus, an interface that enables users to view all these nuances could be an invaluable asset."," Medication (# mentions)","Polarity Works","Pos Neg Yes No Lyrica (934) 42 96 72 21 Cymbalta (413) 11 49 43 20 Savella (338) 21 23 23 2 Neurontin (235) 6 15 13 3 Tramadol (178) 6 3 16 4  Table 7: Sentiment and Efficacy of Medications  The last facet of medication use that was modeled was suggestions and/or recommenda-tions from forum participants. One rule for doing this was by extracting sentences that began with verbs such as: “try,” “take,” “ask,” “tell,” and “go.” Another was to extract sentences with “suggest” or “recommend.” Doing so would retrieve advice such as: “Ask ur doc-20 tor about Elavil and Lyrica combination,” “She suggested staying on the Lyrica.... while... doing the Vitamin D treatment,” and “Word of advice: stop taking SSRI 's at least one week prior to start of Savella.”","Forum posts are valuable because they are rich troves of patient experience; however, their richness means that it is also possible to get lost in the story. An interface that organizes the advice, but also allows one to link to the full text, can help users to orient themselves."]},{"title":"5 Discussion and Implications","paragraphs":["This study employed NLP techniques in order to model two dimensions of patient experience in online support forums: interpersonal interactions and medication use. With regard to interactions with others, the prominence of different individuals and associated affect differed depending on condition. With regard to medication use, patients’ experiences of medication use differed along phase of adoption. These results may have important implica-tions for the design of support forums. For example, in posts about family that contained fear and anxiety, certain topics tended to occur often: family history, families being supportive or non-supportive, and concerns of worrying the family. Forum participants presented various perspectives and suggestions concerning these issues. Thus, one recommendation is that systems could be designed to organize these various perspectives and suggestions in a form that is easier for the viewer to understand.","The results of this study also yielded various insights concerning fibromyalgia. In particular, the prominence of doctors, and relatively infrequent mention of family and friends was worthy of note. Previous research has found that fibromyalgia patients report a lack of understanding from medical practitioners and others around them (e.g. Madden & Sim, 2006; Sim & Madden, 2008). These reports of interactions with medical practitioners could help researchers to understand where gaps in knowledge and communication exist in both parties, and attempt to rectify them. The content from online support forums may also be helpful for researchers seeking to understand patients’ patterns of interpersonal interaction.","The framework presented here for modeling medication use could be useful in many settings. Visualizing side effects at various points in the adoption, use and perhaps discontinuation of a medication could avert potential misunderstandings. For example, sentiment analysis on a medication X might be favorable overall; however, decomposing the posts by phase might show that users initially react favorably, but develop problems with it over time. Of course, the converse, that individuals experience certain side effects initially, but that these disappear over time, could also be true. Such information could be useful to a wide audience, including patients, clinicians, researchers and the pharmaceutical industry. 5.1 Limitations and Future Directions There are many directions in which the current work could be improved. First, in the case of interpersonal interactions, affect was modeled as dichotomous variable indicating presence or absence. However, the level of emotional expression in a post could vary substantially. Thus, it may be useful to employ a lexicon that provides word rankings, such as SentiWordNet (Esuli & Sebastiani, 2006).","In the case of medication use, extraction of relevant sentences was based on presence of the medication name; thus, the system would not have identified sentences in which pronouns were used. A system that performed coreference resolution might identify significantly more references to medications.","Because previous research has indicated that medications are a common topic in fibromyalgia-related discussion, medication use was a natural target for modeling discussion content. However, it would also be useful to extend the modeling to include treatment experiences. Treatments such as massage and aqua therapy are often used in fibromyalgia, and treatments are the foci for many other conditions, such as breast cancer. Rather than considering phases of medication use, one might consider psychological state and expectations prior to, during and after treatment. Lastly, the interface that was developed for exploring medication use was specific to fibromyalgia; moving forward, it would be useful to expand the interface to other conditions."," Acknowledgments  The author would like to thank Dr. Stephanie W.
