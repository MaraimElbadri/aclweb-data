However in many real-world texts, even seemingly objective statements can be opinion-laden in that they often allude nuanced sentiment of the writer (Greene and Resnik, 2009), or purposefully conjure emotion from the readers’ minds (Mohammad and Turney, 2010). Although some researchers have explored formal and statistical treatments of those implicit and implied sentiments (e.g. Wiebe et al. (2005), Esuli and Sebastiani (2006), Greene and Resnik (2009), Davidov et al. (2010)), automatic analysis of them largely remains as a big challenge.","In this paper, we concentrate on understanding the connotative sentiments of words, as they play an important role in interpreting subtle shades of sentiment beyond denotative or surface meaning of text. For instance, consider the following:","Geothermal replaces oil-heating; it helps re-","ducing greenhouse emissions.1 Although this sentence could be considered as a factual statement from the general standpoint, the subtle effect of this sentence may not be entirely objective: this sentence is likely to have an influence on readers’ minds in regard to their opinion toward “geothermal”. In order to sense the subtle overtone of sentiments, one needs to know that the word “emissions” has generally negative connotation, which geothermal reduces. In fact, depending on the pragmatic contexts, it could be precisely the intention of the author to transfer his opinion into the readers’ minds.","The main contribution of this paper is a broad-coverage connotation lexicon that determines the connotative polarity of even those words with ever so subtle connotation beneath their surface meaning, such as “Literature”, “Mediterranean”, and “wine”. Although there has been a number of previous work that constructed sentiment lexicons (e.g., Esuli and Sebastiani (2006), Wilson et al. (2005a), Kaji and Kitsuregawa (2007), Qiu et al. (2009)), which seem to be increasingly and inevitably expanding over words with (strongly) connotative sentiments rather than explicit sentiments alone (e.g., “gun”), little prior work has directly tackled this problem of learning connotation,2","and much of the subtle connotation of many seemingly objective words is yet to be determined.","1","Our learned lexicon correctly assigns negative polarity to emission.","2","A notable exception would be the work of Feng et al. 1774 POSITIVE NEGATIVE FEMA, Mandela, Intel, Google, Python, Sony, Pulitzer, Harvard, Duke, Einstein, Shakespeare, Elizabeth, Clooney, Hoover, Goldman, Swarovski, Hawaii, Yellowstone Katrina, Monsanto, Halliburton, Enron, Teflon, Hiroshima, Holocaust, Afghanistan, Mugabe, Hutu, Saddam, Osama, Qaeda, Kosovo, Helicobacter, HIV Table 1: Example Named Entities (Proper Nouns) with Polar Connotation.","A central premise to our approach is that it is collocational statistics of words that affect and shape the polarity of connotation. Indeed, the etymology of “connotation” is from the Latin “com- ” (“together or with”) and “notare” (“to mark”). It is important to clarify, however, that we do not simply assume that words that collocate share the same polarity of connotation. Although such an assumption played a key role in previous work for the analogous task of learning sentiment lexicon (Velikovich et al., 2010), we expect that the same assumption would be less reliable in drawing subtle connotative sentiments of words. As one example, the predicate “cure”, which has a positive connotation typically takes arguments with negative connotation, e.g., “disease”, when used as the “relieve” sense. 3","Therefore, in order to attain a broad coverage lexicon while maintaining good precision, we guide the induction algorithm with multiple, carefully selected linguistic insights: [1] distributional similarity, [2] semantic parallelism of coordination, [3] selectional preference, and [4] semantic prosody (e.g., Sinclair (1991), Louw (1993), Stubbs (1995), Stefanowitsch and Gries (2003))), and also exploit existing lexical resources as an additional inductive bias.","We cast the connotation lexicon induction task as a collective inference problem, and consider approaches based on three distinct types of algorithmic framework that have been shown successful for conventional sentiment lexicon induction:","Random walk based on HITS/PageRank (e.g., Kleinberg (1999), Page et al.

See §3 for detailed discussion.","3","Note that when “cure” is used as the “preserve” sense, it expects objects with non-negative connotation. Hence word-sense-disambiguation (WSD) presents a challenge, though not unexpectedly. In this work, we assume the general connotation of each word over statistically prevailing senses, leav-ing a more cautious handling of WSD as future work. mani (2002), Velikovich et al. (2010))","Constraint optimization (e.g., Roth and Yih (2004), Choi and Cardie (2009), Lu et al. (2011)). We provide comparative empirical results over several variants of these approaches with comprehensive evaluations including lexicon-based, human judgments, and extrinsic evaluations.","It is worthwhile to note that not all words have connotative meanings that are distinct from denotational meanings, and in some cases, it can be difficult to determine whether the overall sentiment is drawn from denotational or connotative meanings exclusively, or both. Therefore, we encompass any sentiment from either type of meanings into the lexicon, where non-neutral polarity prevails over neutral one if some meanings lead to neutral while others to non-neutral.4","Our work results in the first broad-coverage connotation lexicon,5","significantly improving both the coverage and the precision of Feng et al. (2011). As an interesting by-product, our algorithm can be also used as a proxy to measure the general connotation of real-world named entities based on their collocational statistics. Table 1 highlights some example proper nouns included in the final lexicon.","The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In §2 we describe three types of induction algorithms followed by evaluation in §3. Then we revisit the induction algorithms based on constraint optimization in §4 to enhance quality and scalability. §5 presents comprehensive evaluation with human judges and extrinsic evaluations. Related work and conclusion are in §6 and §7.","4","In general, polysemous words do not seem to have conflicting non-neutral polarities over different senses, though there are many exceptions, e.g., “heat”, or “fine”.

As will be shown, each of these approaches will incorporate additional, more diverse linguistic insights. 2.1 HITS & PageRank The work of Feng et al. (2011) explored the use of HITS (Kleinberg, 1999) and PageRank (Page et al., 1999) to induce the general connotation of words hinging on the linguistic phenomena of selectional preference and semantic prosody, i.e., connotative predicates influencing the connotation of their arguments. For example, the object of a negative connotative predicate “cure” is likely to have negative connotation, e.g., “disease” or “cancer”. The bipartite graph structure for this approach corresponds to the left-most box (labeled as “pred-arg”) in Figure 1. 2.2 Label Propagation With the goal of obtaining a broad-coverage lexicon in mind, we find that relying only on the structure of semantic prosody is limiting, due to relatively small sets of connotative predicates available.6","Therefore, we extend the graph structure as an overlay of two sub-graphs (Figure 1) as described below: 6","For connotative predicates, we use the seed predicate set of Feng et al. (2011), which comprises of 20 positive and 20 negative predicates. Sub-graph #1: Predicate–Argument Graph This sub-graph is the bipartite graph that encodes the selectional preference of connotative predicates over their arguments. In this graph, connotative predicates p reside on one side of the graph and their co-occurring arguments a reside on the other side of the graph based on Google Web 1T corpus.7","The weight on the edges between the predicates p and arguments a are defined using Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) as follows: w(p → a) := P MI(p, a) = log2 P (p, a) P (p)P (a) PMI scores have been widely used in previous studies to measure association between words (e.g., Turney (2001), Church and Hanks (1990)). Sub-graph #2: Argument–Argument Graph The second sub-graph is based on the distributional similarities among the arguments. One possible way of constructing such a graph is simply connecting all nodes and assign edge weights proportionate to the word association scores, such as PMI, or distributional similarity. However, such a completely connected graph can be susceptible to propagating noise, and does not scale well over a very large set of vocabulary.","We therefore reduce the graph connectivity by exploiting semantic parallelism of coordination (Bock (1986), Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown","7","We restrict predicte-argument pairs to verb-object pairs in this study. Note that Google Web 1T dataset consists of n-grams upto n = 5. Since n-gram sequences are too short to apply a parser, we extract verb-object pairs approximately by matching part-of-speech tags. Empirically, when overlaid with the second sub-graph, we found that it is better to keep the connectivity of this sub-graph as uni-directional. That is, we only allow edges to go from a predicate to an argument. 1776 POSITIVE NEGATIVE NEUTRAL","n. avatar, adrenaline, keynote, debut, stakeholder, sunshine, cooperation unbeliever, delay, shortfall, gunshot, misdemeanor, mutiny, rigor header, mark, clothing, outline, grid, gasoline, course, preview","v. handcraft, volunteer, party, accredit, personalize, nurse, google sentence, cough, trap, scratch, debunk, rip, misspell, overcharge state, edit, send, put, arrive, type, drill, name, stay, echo, register","a. floral, vegetarian, prepared, ageless, funded, contemporary debilitating, impaired, swollen, intentional, jarring, unearned same, cerebral, west, uncut, automatic, hydrated, unheated, routine Table 2: Example Words with Learned Connotation: Nouns(n), Verbs(v), Adjectives(a).

In particular, we consider an undirected edge between a pair of arguments a1 and a2 only if they occurred together in the “ a1 and a2” or “ a2 and a1” coordination, and assign edge weights as: w(a1 − a2) = CosineSim(−→a1, −→a2) =","−→a1 · −→a2 ||−→a1|| ||−→a2|| where −→a1 and −→a2 are co-occurrence vectors for a1 and a2 respectively. The co-occurrence vector for each word is computed using PMI scores with respect to the top n co-occurring words.8","n (=50) is selected empirically. The edge weights in two sub-graphs are normalized so that they are in the comparable range.9 Limitations of Graph-based Algorithms Although graph-based algorithms (§2.1, §2.2) provide an intuitive framework to incorporate various lexical relations, limitations include:","1. They allow only non-negative edge weights. Therefore, we can encode only positive (supportive) relations among words (e.g., distributionally similar words will endorse each other with the same polarity), while miss-ing on exploiting negative relations (e.g., antonyms may drive each other into the opposite polarity).","2. They induce positive and negative polarities in isolation via separate graphs. However, we expect that a more effective algorithm should induce both polarities simultaneously. 3. The framework does not readily allow incor-","porating a diverse set of soft and hard con-","straints.","8","We discard edges with cosine similarity ≤ 0, as those indicate either independence or the opposite of similarity.","9","Note that cosine similarity does not make sense for the first sub-graph as there is no reason why a predicate and an argument should be distributionally similar. We experimented with many different variations on the graph structure and edge weights, including ones that include any word pairs that occurred frequently enough together. For brevity, we present the version that achieved the best results here. 2.3 Constraint Optimization Addressing limitations of graph-based algorithms (§2.2), we propose an induction algorithm based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Figure 2 provides the pictorial overview. In comparison to Figure 1, two new components are: (1) dictionary-driven relations targeting enhanced precision, and (2) dictionary-driven words (i.e., unseen words with respect to those relations explored in Figure 1) targeting enhanced coverage. We formulate insights in Figure 2 using ILP as follows:","Definition of sets of words:","1. P+",": the set of positive seed predicates. P−",": the set of negative seed predicates.","2.

For every pair of word i and j, we define binary variables dpq","ij where p, q ∈ {+, −, 0} and dpq","ij = 1 if and only if the polarity of i and j are p and q respectively. Objective function: We aim to maximize:","F = Φprosody + Φcoord","+ Φneu where Φprosody","is the scores based on semantic prosody, Φcoord","captures the distributional similarity over coordination, and Φneu","controls the sensitivity of connotation detection between positive (negative) and neutral.

Second, for some words with distinct sentiment or strong connotation, it can be difficult or even unnatural to draw a precise distinction between connotation and sentiment, e.g., “efficient”. Therefore, sentiment lexicons can serve as a surrogate to measure a subset of connotation words induced by the algorithms, as shown in Table 3 with respect to General Inquirer (Stone and Hunt (1963)) and MPQA (Wilson et al. (2005b)).11 Discussion Table 3 shows the agreement statistics with respect to two conventional sentiment lexicons. We find that the use of label propagation alone [PRED-ARG (CP)] improves the performance substantially over the comparable graph construction with different graph analysis algorithms, in particular, HITS and PageRank approaches of Feng et al. (2011). The two completely connected variants of the graph propagation on the Pred-Arg graph, [ ⊗ PRED-ARG (PMI)] and [⊗","PRED-ARG (CP)], do not necessarily improve the performance over the simpler and computationally lighter alternative, [PRED-ARG (CP)]. The [OVERLAY], which is based on both Pred-Arg and Arg-Arg subgraphs (§2.2), achieves the best performance among graph-based algorithms, significantly improving the precision over all other baselines. This result suggests:","1 The sub-graph #2, based on the semantic parallelism of coordination, is simple and yet very powerful as an inductive bias.","2 The performance of graph propagation varies significantly depending on the graph topology and the corresponding edge weights.

For brevity, the remainder of the paper will focus on the algorithms based on constraint optimization, as it turned out to be the most effective one from the empirical results in §3. Precision In order to see the effectiveness of the induction algorithms more sharply, we had used a limited set of seed words in §3. However to build a lexicon with substantially enhanced precision, we will use as a large seed set as possible, e.g., entire sentiment lexicons13",". Broad coverage Although statistics in Google 1T corpus represent a very large amount of text, words that appear in pred-arg and coordination relations are still limited. To substantially increase the coverage, we will leverage dictionary words (that are not in the corpus) as described in §2.3 and Figure 2. Efficiency One practical problem with ILP is efficiency and scalability. In particular, we found that it becomes nearly impractical to run the ILP formulation including all words in WordNet plus all words in the argument position in Google Web 1T. We therefore explore an alternative approach based on Linear Programming in what follows. 12 In fact, the performance of PRED-ARG variants for top","10K w.r.t. GENINQ is not meaningful as no additional word","was matched beyond top 5k words. 13 Note that doing so will prevent us from evaluating","against the same sentiment lexicon used as a seed set. 4.1 Induction using Linear Programming One straightforward option for Linear Programming formulation may seem like using the same Integer Linear Programming formulation introduced in §2.3, only changing the variable definitions to be real values ∈ [0, 1] rather than integers. However, because the hard constraints in §2.3 are defined based on the assumption that all the variables are binary integers, those constraints are not as meaningful when considered for real numbers. Therefore we revise those hard constraints to encode various semantic relations (WordNet and semantic coordination) more directly. Definition of variables: For each word i, we define variables xi, yi, zi ∈ [0, 1]. i has a positive (negative) connotation if and only if the xi (yi) is assigned the greatest value among the three variables; otherwise, i is neutral.

We consider a word has positive or negative polarity only if the assignment indicates 1 for the corresponding polarity and 0 for the rest. In other words, we treat all words with fractional assignments over different polarities as neutral. Because the optimal so-lutions of LP correspond to extreme points in the convex polytope formed by the constraints, we obtain a large portion of words with non-fractional assignments toward non-neutral polarities. Alternatively, one can round up fractional values. 4.2 Empirical Comparisons: ILP v.s. LP To solve the ILP/LP, we run ILOG CPLEX Optimizer (CPLEX, 2009)) on a 3.5GHz 6 core CPU machine with 96GB RAM. Efficiency-wise, LP runs within 10 minutes while ILP takes several hours. Table 4 shows the results evaluated against MPQA for different variations of ILP and LP. We find that LP variants much better recall and F-score, while maintaining comparable precision.

The highest agreement is 77% by C-LP and the gold standard by AMTV ote",". How good is this? It depends on what is the natural degree of agreement over subtle connotation among people. Therefore, we also report the degree of agreement among human judges in Table 7, where we compute the agreement of one Turker with respect to the gold standard drawn from the rest of the Turkers, and take the average across over all five Turkers18",".

We conjecture that this could be due to generally vary-ing perception of different people on the connotative polarity,19","while the corpus-driven induction algorithms focus on the general connotative polarity corresponding to the most prevalent senses of words in the corpus. 5.2 Extrinsic Evaluation We conduct lexicon-based binary sentiment classification on the following two corpora. SemEval From the SemEval task, we obtain a set of news headlines with annotated scores (rang-ing from -100 to 87). The positive/negative scores indicate the degree of positive/negative polarity orientation. We construct several sets of the positive and negative texts by setting thresholds on the scores as shown in Table 8. “ ≶ n” indicates that the positive set consists of the texts with scores ≥ n and the negative set consists of the texts with scores ≤ −n. Emoticon tweets The sentiment Twitter data20 consists of tweets containing either a smiley emoticon (positive sentiment) or a frowny emoticon (negative sentiment). We filter out the tweets with question marks or more than 30 words, and keep the ones with at least two words in the union of all polar words in the five lexicons in Table 8, and then randomly select 10000 per class. We denote the short text (e.g., content of tweets","or headline texts from SemEval) by t. w repre-","sents the word in t. W +","/W −","is the set of posi-","19","Pearson correlation coefficient among turkers is 0.28, which corresponds to a positive small to medium correlation. Note that when the annotation of turkers is aggregated, we observe agreement as high as 77% with respect to the learned connotation lexicon.","20","http://www.stanford.edu/ãlecmgo/ cs224n/twitterdata.2009.05.25.c.zip 1781","DATA LEXICON TWEET SEMEVAL","≶20 ≶40 ≶60 ≶80 C-LP 70.1 70.8 74.6 80.8 93.5 OVERLAY 68.5 70.0 72.9 76.8 89.6 PRED-ARG (CP) 60.5 64.2 69.3 70.3 79.2 SENTIWN 67.4 61.0 64.5 70.5 79.0 GI+MPQA 65.0 64.5 69.0 74.0 80.5 Table 8: Accuracy on Sentiment Classification (%). tive/negative words of the lexicon. We define the weight of w as s(w). If w is adjective, s(w) = 2; otherwise s(w) = 1. Then the polarity of each text is determined as follows: pol(t) =    positive if W + ∑ w∈t s(w) ≥ W − ∑ w∈t s(w) negative if W + ∑ w∈t s(w) < W − ∑ w∈t s(w)","As shown in Table 8, C-LP generally performs better than the other lexicons on both corpora. Considering that only very simple classification strategy is applied, the result by the connotation lexicon is quite promising.","Finally, Table 1 highlights interesting examples of proper nouns with connotative polarity, e.g., “Mandela”, “Google”, “Hawaii” with positive connotation, and “Monsanto”, “Halliburton”, “Enron” with negative connotation, suggesting that our algorithms could potentially serve as a proxy to track the general connotation of real world entities. Table 2 shows example common nouns with connotative polarity. 5.3 Practical Remarks on WSD and MWEs In this work we aim to find the polarity of most prevalent senses of each word, in part because it is not easy to perform unsupervised word sense disambiguation (WSD) on a large corpus in a reliable way, especially when the corpus consists primarily of short n-grams. Although the resulting lexicon loses on some of the polysemous words with potentially opposite polarities, per-word connotation (rather than per-sense connotation) does have a practical value: it provides a convenient option for users who wish to avoid the burden of WSD before utilizing the lexicon. Future work in-cludes handling of WSD and multi-word expressions (MWEs), e.g., “Great Leader” (for Kim Jong-Il), “Inglourious Basterds” (a movie title).21","21","These examples credit to an anonymous reviewer."]},{"title":"6 Related Work","paragraphs":["A very interesting work of Mohammad and Turney (2010) uses Mechanical Turk in order to build the lexicon of emotions evoked by words. In con-trast, we present an automatic approach that in-fers the general connotation of words. Velikovich et al. (2010) use graph propagation algorithms for constructing a web-scale polarity lexicon for sentiment analysis. Although we employ the same graph propagation algorithm, our graph construction is fundamentally different in that we integrate stronger inductive biases into the graph topology and the corresponding edge weights. As shown in our experimental results, we find that judicious construction of graph structure, exploiting multiple complementing linguistic phenomena can enhance both the performance and the efficiency of the algorithm substantially. Other interesting approaches include one based on min-cut (Dong et al., 2012) or LDA (Xie and Li, 2012). Our proposed approaches are more suitable for encoding a much diverse set of linguistic phenomena however. But our work use a few seed predicates with selectional preference instead of relying on word similarity. Some recent work explored the use of constraint optimization framework for inducing domain-dependent sentiment lexicon (Choi and Cardie (2009), Lu et al. (2011)). Our work differs in that we provide comprehensive insights into different formulations of ILP and LP, aiming to learn the much different task of learning the general connotation of words."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We presented a broad-coverage connotation lexicon that determines the subtle nuanced sentiment of even those words that are objective on the surface, including the general connotation of real-world named entities. Via a comprehensive evaluation, we provided empirical insights into three different types of induction algorithms, and proposed one with good precision, coverage, and efficiency."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This research was supported in part by the Stony Brook University Office of the Vice President for Research.
