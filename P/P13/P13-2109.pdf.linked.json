This results in cubic-time decoders for arc-factored and sibling second-order models (Eisner, 1996; McDonald and Pereira, 2006), and quartic-time for grandparent models (Carreras, 2007) and third-order models (Koo and Collins, 2010). Recently, Rush and Petrov (2012) trained third-order parsers with vine pruning cascades, achieving runtimes only a small factor slower than first-order systems. Third-order features have also been included in transition systems (Zhang and Nivre, 2011) and graph-based parsers with cube-pruning (Zhang and McDonald, 2012).","Unfortunately, non-projective dependency parsers (appropriate for languages with a more flexible word order, such as Czech, Dutch, and German) lag behind these recent advances. The main obstacle is that non-projective parsing is NP-hard beyond arc-factored models (McDonald and Satta, 2007). Approximate parsers have there-fore been introduced, based on belief propagation (Smith and Eisner, 2008), dual decomposition (Koo et al., 2010), or multi-commodity flows (Martins et al., 2009, 2011). These are all in-stances of turbo parsers, as shown by Martins et al. (2010): the underlying approximations come from the fact that they run global inference in factor graphs ignoring loop effects. While this line of research has led to accuracy gains, none of these parsers use third-order contexts, and their speeds are well behind those of projective parsers.","This paper bridges the gap above by presenting the following contributions:","• We apply the third-order feature models of Koo and Collins (2010) to non-projective parsing.","• This extension is non-trivial since exact dynamic programming is not applicable. Instead, we adapt AD3",", the dual decomposition algorithm proposed by Martins et al. (2011), to handle third-order features, by introducing specialized head automata.","• We make our parser substantially faster than the many-components approach of Martins et al. (2011). While AD3","requires solving quadratic subproblems as an intermediate step, recent results (Martins et al., 2012) show that they can be addressed with the same oracles used in the subgradient method (Koo et al., 2010). This enables AD3","to exploit combinatorial subproblems like the the head automata above. Along with this paper, we provide a free distribution of our parsers, including training code.1"]},{"title":"2 Dependency Parsing with AD","paragraphs":["3 Dual decomposition is a class of optimization techniques that tackle the dual of combinatorial","1","Released as TurboParser 2.1, and publicly available at http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TurboParser. 617 Figure 1: Parts considered in this paper. First-order models factor over arcs (Eisner, 1996; McDonald et al., 2005), and second-order models include also consecutive siblings and grandparents (Carreras, 2007). Our parsers add also arbitrary siblings (not necessarily consecutive) and head bigrams, as in Martins et al. (2011), in addition to third-order features for grand- and tri-siblings (Koo and Collins, 2010). problems in a modular and extensible manner (Komodakis et al., 2007; Rush et al., 2010). In this paper, we employ alternating directions dual decomposition (AD3","; Martins et al., 2011). Like the subgradient algorithm of Rush et al. (2010), AD3","splits the original problem into local subproblems, and seeks an agreement on the overlapping variables. The difference is that the AD3 subproblems have an additional quadratic term to accelerate consensus. Recent analysis (Martins et al., 2012) has shown that: (i) AD3","converges at a faster rate,2","and (ii) the quadratic subproblems can be solved using the same combinatorial machinery that is used in the subgradient algorithm. This opens the door for larger subproblems (such as the combination of trees and head automata in Koo et al., 2010) instead of a many-components approach (Martins et al., 2011), while still enjoy-ing faster convergence. 2.1 Our Setup Given a sentence with L words, to which we prepend a root symbol $, let A := {⟨h, m⟩ | h ∈ {0, . . . , L}, m ∈ {1, . . . , L}, h ̸= m} be the set of possible dependency arcs. We parameterize a dependency tree via an indicator vector u := ⟨ua⟩a∈A, where ua is 1 if the arc a is in the tree, and 0 otherwise, and we denote by Y ⊆ R|A| the set of such vectors that are indicators of well-2 Concretely, AD3","needs O(1/ε) iterations to converge to","a ε-accurate solution, while subgradient needs O(1/ε2","). formed trees. Let {As}S","s=1 be a cover of A, where each As ⊆ A. We assume that the score of a parse tree u ∈ Y decomposes as f (u) :=","∑S","s=1 fs(zs), where each zs := ⟨zs,a⟩a∈As is a “partial view” of u, and each local score function fs comes from a feature-based linear model.","Past work in dependency parsing considered either (i) a few “large” components, such as trees and head automata (Smith and Eisner, 2008; Koo et al., 2010), or (ii) many “small” components, coming from a multi-commodity flow formulation (Martins et al., 2009, 2011). Let Ys ⊆ R|As|","denote the set of feasible realizations of zs, i.e., those that are partial views of an actual parse tree. A tuple of views ⟨z1, . . . , zS⟩ ∈","∏S","s=1 Ys is said to be","globally consistent if zs,a = zs′",",a holds for every","a, s and s′","such that a ∈ A","s∩As′. We assume each parse u ∈ Y corresponds uniquely to a globally consistent tuple of views, and vice-versa. Follow-ing Martins et al. (2011), the problem of obtaining the best-scored tree can be written as follows: maximize ∑S s=1 fs(zs)","w.r.t. u ∈ R|A|",", z s ∈ Ys, ∀s s.t. zs,a = ua, ∀s, ∀a ∈ As, (1) where the equality constraint ensures that the partial views “glue” together to form a coherent parse tree.3 2.2 Dual Decomposition and AD3 Dual decomposition methods dualize out the equality constraint in Eq. 1 by introducing Lagrange multipliers λs,a. In doing so, they solve a relaxation where the combinatorial sets Ys are replaced by their convex hulls Zs := conv(Ys).4","All that is necessary is the following assumption: Assumption 1 (Local-Max Oracle). Every s ∈ {1, . . . , S} has an oracle that solves efficiently any instance of the following subproblem: maximize fs(zs) +","∑ a∈As λs,azs,a w.r.t. zs ∈ Ys. (2)","Typically, Assumption 1 is met whenever the max-","imization of fs over Ys is tractable, since the ob-","jective in Eq. 2 just adds a linear function to fs. 3 Note that any tuple ⟨z1, . . . , zS⟩ ∈ ∏S","s=1 Ys satisfying","the equality constraints will be globally consistent; this fact,","due the assumptions above, will imply u ∈ Y. 4 Let ∆|Ys|",":= {α ∈ R|Ys|","| α ≥ 0, ∑","y","s∈Ys αy","s = 1}","be the probability simplex. The convex hull of Ys is the set","conv(Ys) := {","∑ y s∈Ys αy","sys | α ∈ ∆|Ys|","}. Its members","represent marginal probabilities over the arcs in As. 618 The AD3","algorithm (Martins et al., 2011) alter-","nates among the following iterative updates:","• z-updates, which decouple over s = 1, . . . , S, and solve a penalized version of Eq. 2: z(t+1) s := arg max","zs∈Zs fs(zs) +","∑ a∈As λ(t)","s,azs,a","− ρ 2 ∑","a∈As(zs,a − u(t) a )2",". (3) Above, ρ is a constant and the quadratic term penalizes deviations from the current global solution (stored in u(t)",").5","We will see (Prop. 2) that this problem can be solved iteratively using only the Local-Max Oracle (Eq. 2). • u-updates, a simple averaging operation: u(t+1) a := 1","|{s : a∈As}|","∑ s : a∈As z (t+1) s,a . (4)","• λ-updates, where the Lagrange multipliers are adjusted to penalize disagreements:","λ(t+1)","s,a := λ(t) s,a − ρ(z(t+1)","s,a − u(t+1)","a ). (5)","In sum, the only difference between AD3","and the subgradient method is in the z-updates, which in AD3","require solving a quadratic problem. While closed-form solutions have been developed for some specialized components (Martins et al., 2011), this problem is in general more difficult than the one arising in the subgradient algorithm. However, the following result, proved in Martins et al. (2012), allows to expand the scope of AD3 to any problem which satisfies Assumption 1. Proposition 2. The problem in Eq. 3 admits a solution z∗","s which is spanned by a sparse basis W ⊆ Ys with cardinality at most |W| ≤ O(|As|). In other words, there is a distribution α with support in W such that z∗","s =","∑","ys∈W αysys.6 Prop. 2 has motivated an active set algorithm","(Martins et al., 2012) that maintains an estimate","of W by iteratively adding and removing elements","computed through the oracle in Eq. 2.7","Typically,","very few iterations are necessary and great speed-","ups are achieved by warm-starting W with the ac-","tive set computed in the previous AD3","iteration.","This has a huge impact in practice and is crucial to","obtain the fast runtimes in §4 (see Fig. 2). 5 In our experiments (§4), we set ρ = 0.05. 6 Note that |Ys| = O(2|As|",") in general. What Prop. 2","tells us is that the solution of Eq. 3 can be represented as a","distribution over Ys with a very sparse support. 7 The algorithm is a specialization of Nocedal and Wright","(1999), §16.4, which effectively exploits the sparse represen-","tation of z∗","s.
