For a given query, the retrieved Web snippets are automatically clustered and presented to the user with meaningful labels in order to minimize the information search process. This technique can be particularly useful for polysemous queries but it is hard to implement efficiently and effectively (Carpineto et al., 2009). Indeed, as opposed to classical text clustering, PRC must deal with small collections of short text fragments (Web snippets) and be processed in run-time.","As a consequence, most of the successful methodologies follow a monothetic approach (Zamir and Etzioni, 1998; Ferragina and Gulli, 2008; Carpineto and Romano, 2010; Navigli and Crisafulli, 2010; Scaiella et al., 2012). The underlying idea is to discover the most discriminant topical words in the collection and group together Web snippets containing these relevant terms. On the other hand, the polythetic approach which main idea is to represent Web snippets as word feature vectors has received less attention, the only relevant work being (Osinski and Weiss, 2005). The main reasons for this situation are that (1) word feature vectors are hard to define in small collections of short text fragments (Timonen, 2013), (2) existing second-order similarity measures such as the cosine are unadapted to capture the semantic similarity between small texts, (3) Latent Semantic Analysis has evidenced inconclusive results (Osinski and Weiss, 2005) and (4) the labeling process is a surprisingly hard extra task (Carpineto et al., 2009).","This paper is motivated by the fact that the polythetic approach should lead to improved results if correctly applied to small collections of short text fragments. For that purpose, we propose a new methodology that adapts the classical K-means algorithm to a third-order similarity measure initially developed for Topic Segmentation (Dias et al., 2007). Moreover, the adapted K-means algorithm allows to label each cluster directly from its centroids thus avoiding the abovementioned extra task. Finally, the evolution of the objective function of the adapted K-means is modeled to automatically define the “best” number of clusters.","Finally, we propose different experiments over the ODP-239 (Carpineto and Romano, 2010) and MORESQUE (Navigli and Crisafulli, 2010) datasets against the most competitive text-based PRC algorithms: STC (Zamir and Etzioni, 1998), LINGO (Osinski and Weiss, 2005), OPTIMSRC (Carpineto and Romano, 2010) and the classical bisecting incremental K-means (which may be seen as a baseline for the polythetic paradigm)1",". A new evaluation measure called the b-cubed F - measure (Fb3) and defined in (Amigó et al., 2009) is then calculated to evaluate both cluster homogeneity and completeness. Results evidence that our proposal outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches with a maximum Fb3 = 0.452 for ODP-239 and Fb3 = 0.490 for MORESQUE. 1","The TOPICAL algorithm proposed by (Scaiella et al., 2012) is a knowledge-driven methodology based on Wikipedia. 153"]},{"title":"2 Polythetic Post-Retrieval Clustering","paragraphs":["The K-means is a geometric clustering algorithm (Lloyd, 1982). Given a set of n data points, the algorithm uses a local search approach to partition the points into K clusters. A set of K initial cluster centers is chosen. Each point is then assigned to the center closest to it and the centers are recomputed as centers of mass of their assigned points. The process is repeated until convergence. To as-sure convergence, an objective function Q is defined which decreases at each processing step. The classical objective function is defined in Equation (1) where πk is a cluster labeled k, xi ∈ πk is an object in the cluster, mπk is the centroid of the cluster πk and E(., .) is the Euclidean distance. Q = K ∑ k=1 ∑ x i∈π","k","E(xi, mπ k )2",". (1)","Within the context of PRC, the K-means algorithm needs to be adapted to integrate third-order similarity measures (Mihalcea et al., 2006; Dias et al., 2007). Third-order similarity measures, also called weighted second-order similarity measures, do not rely on exact matches of word features as classical second-order similarity measures (e.g. the cosine metric), but rather evaluate similarity based on related matches. In this paper, we propose to use the third-order similarity measure called InfoSimba introduced in (Dias et al., 2007) for Topic Segmentation and implement its simplified versionS3","s in Equation 2. S3 s (Xi, Xj) = 1 p2 p ∑ k=1 p ∑ l=1 Xik ∗ Xjl ∗ S(Wik, Wjl).

Wjl) corresponds to the word at the kth","(resp. lth",") position in the vector Xi (resp. Xj) and Xik (resp. Xjl) is the weight of word Wik (resp. Wjl) in the set of retrieved Web snippets. A direct consequence of the change in similarity measure is the definition of a new objective function QS3","s to ensure convergence. This function is defined in Equation (3) and must be maximized2",". 2 A maximization process can easily be transformed into a","minimization one","QS3 s = K ∑ k=1 ∑ x i∈π","k S3 s (xi, mπ","k ).

For that purpose, we define a procedure which consists in selecting the best p words from the global vocabulary V in such a way that QS3","s increases. The global vocabulary is the set of all words which appear in any context vector.","So, for each word w ∈ V and any symmetric similarity measure S(., .), its interestingness λk","(w) is computed as regards to cluster π","k.

To solve a clustering problem with M clusters, all intermediate problems with 1, 2, ..., M − 1 clusters are sequentially solved. The underlying idea is that an optimal solution for a clustering problem with M clusters can be obtained using a series of local searches using the K-means algorithm. At each local search, the M − 1 cluster centers are always initially placed at their optimal positions corresponding to the clustering problem with M − 1 clusters. The remaining M th","cluster center is initially placed at several positions within the data space. In addition to effectiveness, the method is deterministic and does not depend on any initial conditions or empirically adjustable parameters. Moreover, its adaptation to PRC is straightforward."]},{"title":"3 Stopping Criterion","paragraphs":["Once clustering has been processed, selecting the best number of clusters still remains to be decided. 154 For that purpose, numerous procedures have been proposed (Milligan and Cooper, 1985). However, none of the listed methods were effective or adaptable to our specific problem.

To better understand the behaviour of QS3","s at each step of the adapted GK-means algorithm, we present its values for K = 10 in Figure 1.","Figure 1: QS3 s and its modelisation.

In order to illustrate the soundness of the procedure, we present the different values for β at each K iteration and the differences between consecutive values of β at each iteration in Figure 2.

So, in order to evaluate our methodology, we propose two different evaluations. First, we want to evidence the quality of the stopping criterion when compared to an exhaustive search over all tunable parameters. Second, we propose a comparative evaluation with existing state-of-the-art algorithms over gold standard datasets and recent clustering evaluation metrics. 4.1 Text Processing Before the clustering process takes place, Web snippets are represented as word feature vectors. In order to define the set of word features, the Web service proposed in (Machado et al., 2009) is used3",". In particular, it assigns a relevance score to any token present in the set of retrieved Web snippets based on the analysis of left and right token contexts. A specific threshold is then applied to withdraw irrelevant tokens and the remaining ones form the vocabulary V . Then, each Web snippet is represented by the set of its p most relevant tokens in the sense of the W (.) value proposed in (Machado et al., 2009). Note that within the proposed Web service, multiword units are also identified. They are exclusively composed of relevant individual tokens and their weight is given by the arithmetic mean of their constituents scores. 3 Access to this Web service is available upon request. 4.2 Intrinsic Evaluation The first set of experiments focuses on understand-ing the behaviour of our methodology within a greedy search strategy for different tunable parameters defined as a tuple < p, K, S(Wik, Wjl) >. In particular, p is the size of the word feature vectors representing both Web snippets and centroids (p = 2..5), K is the number of clusters to be found (K = 2..10) and S(Wik, Wjl) is the collocation measure integrated in the InfoSimba similarity measure. In these experiments, two association measures which are known to have different behaviours (Pecina and Schlesinger, 2006) are tested. We implement the Symmetric Conditional Probability (Silva et al., 1999) in Equation (7) which tends to give more credits to frequent as-sociations and the Pointwise Mutual Information (Church and Hanks, 1990) in Equation (8) which over-estimates infrequent associations. Then, best < p, K, S(Wik, Wjl) > configurations are compared to our stopping criterion. SCP (Wik, Wjl) =","P (Wik, Wjl)2 P (Wik) × P (Wjl) . (7) P MI(Wik, Wjl) = log2","P (Wik, Wjl) P (Wik) × P (Wjl) . (8)","In order to perform this task, we evaluate performance based on the Fb3 measure defined in (Amigó et al., 2009) over the ODP-239 gold standard dataset proposed in (Carpineto and Romano, 156 2010). In particular, (Amigó et al., 2009) indicate that common metrics such as the Fβ-measure are good to assign higher scores to clusters with high homogeneity, but fail to evaluate cluster completeness. First results are provided in Table 1 and evidence that the best configurations for different < p, K, S(Wik, Wjl) > tuples are obtained for high values of p, K ranging from 4 to 6 clusters and P M I steadily improving over SCP . However, such a fuzzy configuration is not satisfactory. As such, we proposed a new stopping criterion which evidences coherent results as it (1) does not depend on the used association measure (F SCP","b3 = 0.452 and F P MI","b3 = 0.450), (2) discovers similar numbers of clusters independently of the length of the p-context vector and (3) increases performance with high values of p. 4.3 Comparative Evaluation The second evaluation aims to compare our methodology to current state-of-the-art text-based PRC algorithms. We propose comparative experiments over two gold standard datasets (ODP-239 (Carpineto and Romano, 2010) and MORESQUE (Di Marco and Navigli, 2013)) for STC (Zamir and Etzioni, 1998), LINGO (Osinski and Weiss, 2005), OPTIMSRC (Carpineto and Romano, 2010) and the Bisecting Incremental K-means (BIK) which may be seen as a baseline for the polythetic paradigm. A brief description of each PRC algorithm is given as follows. STC: (Zamir and Etzioni, 1998) defined the Suffix Tree Clustering algorithm which is still a difficult standard to beat in the field. In particular, they propose a monothetic clustering technique which merges base clusters with high string overlap. Indeed, instead of using the classical Vector Space Model (VSM) representation, they propose to represent Web snippets as compact tries. LINGO: (Osinski and Weiss, 2005) proposed a polythetic solution called LINGO which takes into account the string representation proposed by (Zamir and Etzioni, 1998). They first extract frequent phrases based on suffix-arrays. Then, they reduce the term-document matrix (defined as a VSM) using Single Value Decomposition to discover latent structures. Finally, they match group descriptions with the extracted topics and assign relevant documents to them. OPTIMSRC: (Carpineto and Romano, 2010) showed that the characteristics of the outputs returned by PRC algorithms suggest the adoption of a meta clustering approach. As such, they introduce a novel criterion to measure the concordance of two partitions of objects into different clusters based on the information content associated to the series of decisions made by the partitions on single pairs of objects. Then, the meta clustering phase is casted to an optimization problem of the concordance between the clustering combination and the given set of clusterings.","With respect to implementation, we used the Carrot2 APIs4","which are freely available for STC, LINGO and the classical BIK. It is worth notic-ing that all implementations in Carrot2 are tuned to extract exactly 10 clusters. For OPTIMSRC, we reproduced the results presented in the paper of (Carpineto and Romano, 2010) as no implementation is freely available. The results are illustrated in Table 2 including both Fβ-measure and Fb3. They evidence clear improvements of our methodology when compared to state-of-the-art text-based PRC algorithms, over both datasets and all evaluation metrics. But more important, even when the p-context vector is small (p = 3), the adapted GK-means outperforms all other existing text-based PRC which is particularly important as they need to perform in real-time."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this paper, we proposed a new PRC approach which (1) is based on the adaptation of the K-means algorithm to third-order similarity measures and (2) proposes a coherent stopping criterion.
