We describe an end-to-end discriminative probabilistic model for coreference that, along with standard pairwise features, enforces structural agreement constraints between specified properties of coreferent mentions. This model can be represented as a factor graph for each document that admits efficient inference via belief propaga-tion. We show that our method can use entity-level information to outperform a basic pairwise system."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The inclusion of entity-level features has been a driving force behind the development of many coreference resolution systems (Luo et al., 2004; Rahman and Ng, 2009; Haghighi and Klein, 2010; Lee et al., 2011). There is no polynomial-time dynamic program for inference in a model with arbitrary entity-level features, so systems that use such features typically rely on making decisions in a pipelined manner and sticking with them, operating greedily in a left-to-right fashion (Rahman and Ng, 2009) or in a multi-pass, sieve-like manner (Raghunathan et al., 2010). However, such systems may be locked into bad coreference decisions and are difficult to directly optimize for standard evaluation metrics.","In this work, we present a new structured model of entity-level information designed to allow efficient inference. We use a log-linear model that can be expressed as a factor graph. Pairwise features appear in the model as unary factors, adjacent to nodes representing a choice of antecedent (or none) for each mention. Additional nodes model entity-level properties on a per-mention basis, and structural agreement factors softly drive properties of coreferent mentions to agree with one another. This is a key feature of our model: mentions man-age their partial membership in various coreference chains, so that information about entity-level properties is decentralized and propagated across individual mentions, and we never need to explicitly instantiate entities.","Exact inference in this factor graph is intractable, but efficient approximate inference can be carried out with belief propagation. Our model is the first discriminatively-trained model that both makes joint decisions over an entire document and models specific entity-level properties, rather than simply enforcing transitivity of pairwise decisions (Finkel and Manning, 2008; Song et al., 2012).","We evaluate our system on the dataset from the CoNLL 2011 shared task using three different types of properties: synthetic oracle properties, entity phi features (number, gender, animacy, and NER type), and properties derived from unsupervised clusters targeting semantic type information. In all cases, our transitive model of entity properties equals or outperforms our pairwise system and our reimplementation of a previous entity-level system (Rahman and Ng, 2009). Our final system is competitive with the winner of the CoNLL 2011 shared task (Lee et al., 2011)."]},{"title":"2 Example","paragraphs":["We begin with an example motivating our use of entity-level features. Consider the following excerpt concerning two famous auction houses: When looking for [art items], [people] go to [Sotheby’s and Christie’s] because [they]A believe [they]B can get the best price for [them].","The first three mentions are all distinct entities, theyA and theyB refer to people, and them refers to art items. The three pronouns are tricky to resolve 114 automatically because they could at first glance resolve to any of the preceding mentions. We focus in particular on the resolution of theyA and them. In order to correctly resolve theyA to people rather than Sotheby’s and Christie’s, we must take advantage of the fact that theyA appears as the subject of the verb believe, which is much more likely to be attributed to people than to auction houses.","Binding principles prevent them from attaching to theyB. But how do we prevent it from choosing as its antecedent the next closest agreeing pronoun, theyA? One way is to exploit the correct coreference decision we have already made, theyA referring to people, since people are not as likely to have a price as art items are. This observa-tion argues for enforcing agreement of entity-level semantic properties during inference, specifically properties relating to permitted semantic roles. Because even these six mentions have hundreds of potential partitions into coreference chains, we cannot search over partitions exhaustively, and therefore we must design our model to be able to use this information while still admitting an efficient inference scheme."]},{"title":"3 Models","paragraphs":["We will first present our BASIC model (Section 3.1) and describe the features it incorporates (Section 3.2), then explain how to extend it to use transitive features (Sections 3.3 and 3.4).","Throughout this section, let x be a variable containing the words in a document along with any relevant precomputed annotation (such as parse information, semantic roles, etc.), and let n denote the number of mentions in a given document. 3.1 BASIC Model Our BASIC model is depicted in Figure 1 in standard factor graph notation. Each mention i has an associated random variable ai taking values in the set {1, . . . , i−1, <new>}; this variable specifies mention i’s selected antecedent or indicates that it begins a new coreference chain. Let a = (a1, ..., an) be the vector of the ai. Note that a set of coreference chains C (the final desired output) can be uniquely determined from a, but a is not uniquely determined by C.","We use a log linear model of the conditional distribution P (a|x) as follows: P (a|x) ∝ exp ( n ∑ i=1","wT fA(i, ai, x) ) When looking for [art items], [people] go to [Sotheby's and Christie's] because [they]A believe [they]B can get","the best price for [them]. art items 0.15 people 0.4 Sotheby’s and Christie’s 0.4 <new> 0.05 a2 a3 a4a1 A1 A2 A3 A4 art items 0.05 <new> 0.95 antecedent choices antecedent factors"]},{"title":"} }","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Our BASIC coreference model. A decision ai is made independently for each mention about what its antecedent mention should be or whether it should start a new coreference chain. Each unary factor Ai has a log-linear form with features examining mention i, its selected antecedent ai, and the document context x. where fA(i, ai, x) is a feature function that examines the coreference decision ai for mention i with document context x; note that this feature function can include pairwise features based on mention i and the chosen antecedent ai, since information about each mention is contained in x.","Because the model factors completely over the individual ai, these feature functions fA can be expressed as unary factors Ai (see Figure 1), with Ai(j) ∝ exp ( wT","fA(i, j, x)",")",". Given a setting of w, we can determine â = arg maxa P (a|x) and then deterministically compute C(a), the final set of coreference chains.","While the features of this model factor over coreference links, this approach differs from classical pairwise systems such as Bengtson and Roth (2008) or Stoyanov et al. (2010). Because potential antecedents compete with each other and with the non-anaphoric hypothesis, the choice of ai actually represents a joint decision about i−1 pairwise links, as opposed to systems that use a pairwise binary classifier and a separate agglomera-tion step, which consider one link at a time during learning. This approach is similar to the mention-ranking model of Rahman and Ng (2009). 3.2 Pairwise Features We now present the set of features fA used by our unary factors Ai. Each feature examines the an-115 tecedent choice ai of the current mention as well as the observed information x in the document. For each of the features we present, two conjoined versions are included: one with an indicator of the type of the current mention being resolved, and one with an indicator of the types of the current and antecedent mentions. Mention types are either NOMINAL, PROPER, or, if the mention is pronominal, a canonicalized version of the pronoun abstracting away case.1","Several features, especially those based on the precise constructs (apposition, etc.) and those incorporating phi feature information, are computed using the machinery in Lee et al. (2011). Other features were inspired by Song et al. (2012) and Rahman and Ng (2009). Anaphoricity features: Indicator of anaphoricity, indicator on definiteness. Configurational features: Indicator on distance in mentions (capped at 10), indicator on distance in sentences (capped at 10), does the antecedent c-command the current mention, are the two mentions in a subject/object construction, are the mentions nested, are the mentions in deterministic appositive/role appositive/predicate nominative/relative pronoun constructions. Match features: Is one mention an acronym of the other, head match, head contained (each way), string match, string contained (each way), relaxed head match features from Lee et al. (2011). Agreement features: Gender, number, animacy, and NER type of the current mention and the antecedent (separately and conjoined). Discourse features: Speaker match conjoined with an indicator of whether the document is an article or conversation.","Because we use conjunctions of these base features together with the antecedent and mention type, our system can capture many relationships that previous systems hand-coded, especially regarding pronouns. For example, our system has access to features such as “ it is non-anaphoric”, “ it has as its antecedent a geopolitical entity”, or “ I has as its antecedent I with the same speaker.”","1","While this canonicalization could theoretically impair our ability to resolve, for example, reflexive pronouns, conjoining features with raw pronoun strings does not improve performance.","We experimented with synonymy and hypernymy features from WordNet (Miller, 1995), but these did not empirically improve performance. 3.3 TRANSITIVE Model The BASIC model can capture many relationships between pairs of mentions, but cannot necessarily capture entity-level properties like those discussed in Section 2. We could of course model entities directly (Luo et al., 2004; Rahman and Ng, 2009), saying that each mention refers to some prior entity rather than to some prior mention. However, inference in this model would require reasoning about all possible partitions of mentions, which is computationally infeasible without resorting to severe approximations like a left-to-right inference method (Rahman and Ng, 2009).","Instead, we would like to try to preserve the tractability of the BASIC model while still being able to exploit entity-level information. To do so, we will allow each mention to maintain its own distributions over values for a number of properties; these properties could include gender, named-entity type, or semantic class. Then, we will require each anaphoric mention to agree with its antecedent on the value of each of these properties.","Our TRANSITIVE model which implements this scheme is shown in Figure 2. Each mention i has been augmented with a single property node pi ∈ {1, ..., k}. The unary Pi factors encode prior knowledge about the setting of each pi; these factors may be hard (I will not refer to a plural entity), soft (such as a distribution over named entity types output by an NER tagger), or practically uniform (e.g. the last name Smith does not specify a particular gender).","To enforce agreement of a particular property, we require a mention to have the same property value as its antecedent. That is, for mentions i and j, if ai = j, we want to ensure that pi and pj agree. We can achieve this with the following set of structural equality factors: Ei−j(ai, pi, pj) = 1 − I[ai = j ∧ pi ̸= pj] In words, this factor is zero if both ai = j and pi disagrees with pj. These equality factors essentially provide a mechanism by which these priors Pi can influence the coreference decisions: if, for example, the factors Pi and Pj disagree very strongly, choosing ai ̸= j will be preferred in order to avoid forcing one of pi or pj to take an undesirable value.

Each node ai now has a property pi, which is informed by its own unary factor Pi. In our example, a4 strongly indicates that mentions 2 and 4 are coreferent; the factor E4−2 then enforces equality between p2 and p4, while the factor E4−3 has no effect. only indicates a single antecedent, the transitive nature of the E factors forces pi to agree with the p nodes of all other mentions likely to be in the same entity. 3.4 Property Projection So far, our model as specified ensures agreement of our entity-level properties, but strictly enforcing agreement may not always be correct. Suppose that we are using named entity type as an entity-level property. Organizations and geo-political entities are two frequently confused and ambiguous tags, and in the gold-standard coreference chains it may be the case that a single chain contains in-stances of both. We might wish to learn that organizations and geo-political entities are “compatible” in the sense that we should forgive entities for containing both, but without losing the ability to reject a chain containing both organizations and people, for example.","To address these effects, we expand our model as indicated in Figure 3. As before, we have a set of properties pi and agreement factors Eij. On top of that, we introduce the notion of raw property values ri ∈ {1, ..., k} together with priors in the form of the Ri factors. The ri and pi could in principle have different domains, but for this work we take them to have the same domain. The Pi factors now have a new structure: they now represent a featurized projection of the ri onto the pi, which can now be thought of as “coreference-p4p3p2 r4r3r2 P2 P3 P4 R2 R3 R4","raw property factors raw properties projection factors projected properties"]},{"title":"} } } }","paragraphs":["a2 a4 A2 A3 A4","a3E3-1 E4-1 Figure 3: The complete factor graph for our TRANSITIVE coreference model.

The Pi factors are defined by Pi(pi, ri) ∝ exp(wT","fP (pi, ri)), where fP is a feature vector over the projection of ri onto pi.

The first issue to address is one of the supervision provided. Our model traffics in sets of labels a which are more specified than gold coreference chains C, which give cluster membership for each mention but not antecedence. Let A(C) be the set of labelings a that are consistent with a set of coreference chains C. For example, if C = {{1, 2, 3}, {4}}, then (<new>, 1, 2, <new>) ∈ A(C) and (<new>, 1, 1, <new>) ∈ A(C) but (<new>, 1, <new>, 3) /∈ A(C), since this implies the chains C = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}","The most natural objective is a variant of standard conditional log-likelihood that treats the choice of a for the specifiedC as a latent variable to be marginalized out: l(w) = t ∑ i=1 log   ∑","a∈A(Ci )","P (a|xi )   (1) where (xi",", Ci",") is the ith labeled training example. This optimizes for the 0-1 loss; however, we are much more interested in optimizing with respect to a coreference-specific loss function.","To this end, we will use softmax-margin (Gimpel and Smith, 2010), which augments the probability of each example with a term proportional to its loss, pushing the model to assign less mass to highly incorrect examples.

Commonly-used coreference metrics such as MUC (Vilain et al., 1995) and B3 (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) do not have this property, so we instead make use of a parameterized loss function that does and fit the parameters to give good performance. Specifically, we take l(a, C) = n ∑ i=1 [c1I(K1(ai, C)) + c2I(K2(ai, C)) + c3I(K3(ai, C))] where c1, c2, and c3 are real-valued weights, K1 denotes the event that ai is falsely anaphoric when it should be non-anaphoric, K2 denotes the event that ai is falsely non-anaphoric when it should be anaphoric, and K3 denotes the event that ai is correctly determined to be anaphoric but . These can be computed based on only ai and C. By setting c1 low and c2 high relative to c3, we can force the system to be less conservative about making anaphoricity decisions and achieve a better balance with the final coreference metrics.","Finally, we incorporate L1 regularization, giv-ing us our final objective: l(w) = t ∑ i=1 log   ∑","a∈A(Ci )","P ′ (a|xi",")   + λ∥w∥1","We optimize this objective using AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011); we found this to be faster and give higher performance than L-BFGS using L2 regularization (Liu and Nocedal, 1989).

Exact inference is intractable due to the E factors that couple all of the ai by way of the pi nodes. However, we can compute approximate marginals for the ai, pi, and ri using belief propagation. BP has been effectively used on other NLP tasks (Smith and Eisner, 2008; Burkett and Klein, 2012), and is effective in cases such as this where the model is largely driven by non-loopy factors (here, the Ai).","From marginals over each node, we can compute the necessary gradient and decode as before:","â = arg max a P̂ (a|x)","3","One could use ILP-based decoding in the style of Finkel and Manning (2008) and Song et al. (2012) to attempt to explicitly find the optimalC with choice of a marginalized out, but we did not explore this option. 118 This corresponds to minimum-risk decoding with respect to the Hamming loss over antecedence predictions. Pruning. The TRANSITIVE model requires in-stantiating a factor for each potential setting of each ai. This factor graph grows quadratically in the size of the document, and even approximate inference becomes slow when a document contains over 200 mentions. Therefore, we use our BASIC model to prune antecedent choices for each ai in order to reduce the size of the factor graph that we must instantiate. Specifically, we prune links between pairs of mentions that are of mention distance more than 100, as well as values for ai that fall below a particular odds ratio threshold with respect to the best setting of that ai in the BASIC model; that is, those for which log (","PBASIC (ai|x) maxj PBASIC (ai = j|x) ) is below a cutoff γ."]},{"title":"6 Related Work","paragraphs":["Our BASIC model is a mention-ranking approach resembling models used by Denis and Baldridge (2008) and Rahman and Ng (2009), though it is trained using a novel parameterized loss function. It is also similar to the MLN-JOINT(BF) model of Song et al. (2012), but we enforce the single-parent constraint at a deeper structural level, allowing us to treat non-anaphoricity symmetrically with coreference as in Denis and Baldridge (2007) and Stoyanov and Eisner (2012). The model of Fernandes et al. (2012) also uses the single-parent constraint structurally, but with learning via latent perceptron and ILP-based one-best decoding rather than logistic regression and BP-based marginal computation.","Our TRANSITIVE model is novel; while McCallum and Wellner (2004) proposed the idea of using attributes for mentions, they do not actually implement a model that does so. Other systems include entity-level information via handwritten rules (Raghunathan et al., 2010), induced rules (Yang et al., 2008), or features with learned weights (Luo et al., 2004; Rahman and Ng, 2011), but all of these systems freeze past coreference decisions in order to compute their entities.","Most similar to our entity-level approach is the system of Haghighi and Klein (2010), which also uses approximate global inference; however, theirs is an unsupervised, generative system and they attempt to directly model multinomials over words in each mention. Their system could be extended to handle property information like we do, but our system has many other advantages, such as freedom from a pre-specified list of entity types, the ability to use multiple input clusterings, and discriminative projection of clusters."]},{"title":"7 Experiments","paragraphs":["We use the datasets, experimental setup, and scor-ing program from the CoNLL 2011 shared task (Pradhan et al., 2011), based on the OntoNotes corpus (Hovy et al., 2006).

For this experiment, mention properties are derived from corrupted oracle information about the true underlying coreference cluster. Each coreference cluster is assumed to have one underlying value for each of m coreference properties, each taking values over a do-main D. Mentions then sample distributions over D from a Dirichlet distribution peaked around the true underlying value.8","These posteriors are taken as the Ri for the TRANSITIVE model.","We choose this setup to reflect two important properties of entity-level information: first, that it may come from a variety of disparate sources, and second, that it may be based on the determinations of upstream models which produce posteriors naturally.

Still, we see that all models are able to benefit from incorporating this information; however, our TRANSITIVE model outperforms both the PAIRPROPERTY model and the LEFTTORIGHT model. There are a few reasons for this: first, our model is able to directly use soft posteriors, so it is able to exploit the fact that more peaked samples from the Dirichlet are more likely to be correct. Moreover, our model can propagate information backwards in a document as well as forwards, so the effects of noise can be more easily mitigated. By contrast, in the LEFTTORIGHT model, if the first or second mention in a cluster has the wrong property value, features indicating high levels of property agreement will not fire on the next few mentions in those clusters. 7.3 Phi Features As we have seen, our TRANSITIVE model can exploit high-quality entity-level features.

We also show in in Table 5 the results of our system on the CoNLL test set, and see that it performs comparably to the Stanford coreference system (Lee et al., 2011).

However, we found no simple way to change the relative performance characteristics of our various systems; notably, modifying the parameters of the loss function mentioned in Section 4 or changing it entirely did not trade off these three metrics but merely increased or decreased them in lockstep. Therefore, the TRANSITIVE system actually substantially improves over our baselines and is not merely trading off metrics in a way that could be easily reproduced through other means."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this work, we presented a novel coreference architecture that can both take advantage of standard pairwise features as well as use transitivity to enforce coherence of decentralized entity-level properties within coreference clusters. Our transitive system is more effective at using properties than a pairwise system and a previous entity-level system, and it achieves performance comparable to that of the Stanford coreference resolution system, the winner of the CoNLL 2011 shared task."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was partially supported by BBN under DARPA contract HR0011-12-C-0014, by an NSF fellowship for the first author, and by a Google fellowship for the second.
