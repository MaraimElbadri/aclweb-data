The easy-first parser has been applied to many applications (Seeker et al., 2012; Søggard and Wulff, 2012). By processing the input tokens in an easy-to-hard order, the algorithm could make use of structured information on both sides of the hard token thus making more indicative predictions. However, rich structured information also causes exhaustive inference intractable. As an alternative, greedy search which only explores a tiny fraction of the search space is adopted (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010).","To enlarge the search space, a natural extension to greedy search is beam search. Recent work also shows that beam search together with perceptron-based global learning (Collins, 2002) enable the use of non-local features that are helpful to improve parsing performance without overfitting (Zhang and Nivre, 2012). Due to the-se advantages, beam search and global learning has been applied to many NLP tasks (Collins and Roark 2004; Zhang and Clark, 2007). However, to the best of our knowledge, no work in the literature has ever applied the two techniques to easy-first dependency parsing.","While applying beam-search is relatively straightforward, the main difficulty comes from combining easy-first dependency parsing with perceptron-based global learning. In particular, one needs to guarantee that each parameter update is valid, i.e., the correct action sequence has lower model score than the predicted one1",". The difficulty in ensuring validity of parameter update for the easy-first algorithm is caused by its spurious ambiguity, i.e., the same result might be derived by more than one action sequences.","For algorithms which do not exhibit spurious ambiguity, “early update” (Collins and Roark 2004) is always valid: at the k-th step when the single correct action sequence falls off the beam, 1 As shown by (Huang et al., 2012), only valid update guarantees the convergence of any perceptron-based training. Invalid update may lead to bad learning or even make the learning not converge at all. Figure 1: Example of cases without/with spurious ambiguity. The 3 × 1 table denotes a beam. “C/P” denotes correct/predicted action sequence. The numbers following C/P are model scores."," 110 its model score must be lower than those still in the beam (as illustrated in figure 1, also see the proof in (Huang et al., 2012)). While for easy-first dependency parsing, there could be multiple action sequences that yield the gold result (C1 and C2 in figure 1). When all correct sequences fall off the beam, some may indeed have higher model score than those still in the beam (C2 in figure 1), causing invalid update.","For the purpose of valid update, we present a simple solution which is based on early update. The basic idea is to use one of the correct action sequences that were pruned right at the k-th step (C1 in figure 1) for parameter update.","The proposed solution is general and can also be applied to other algorithms that exhibit spurious ambiguity, such as easy-first POS tagging (Ma et al., 2012) and transition-based dependency parsing with dynamic oracle (Goldberg and Nivre, 2012). In this paper, we report experimental results on both easy-first dependency parsing and POS tagging (Ma et al., 2012). We show that both easy-first POS tagging and dependency parsing can be improved significantly from beam search and global learning. Specifically, on CTB we achieve 94.01% tagging accuracy which is the best result to date","2","for a single tagging model. With a relatively small beam, we achieve 86.33% unlabeled score (assume gold tags), better than state-of-the-art transition-based parsers (Huang and Sagae, 2010; Zhang and Nivre, 2011). On PTB, we also achieve good results that are comparable to the state-of-the-art."]},{"title":"2 Easy-first dependency parsing","paragraphs":["The easy-first dependency parsing algorithm (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010) builds a dependency tree by performing two types of actions LEFT(i) and RIGHT(i) to a list of sub-tree structures p1,..., pr. pi is initialized with the i-th word 2 Joint tagging-parsing models achieve higher accuracy, but those models are not directly comparable to ours.

Current work (Huang et al., 2012) rigorously explained that only valid update ensures convergence of any perceptron variants. They also justified that the popular “early update” (Collins and Roark, 2004) is valid for the systems that do not exhibit spurious ambiguity4",".","However, for the easy-first algorithm or more generally, systems that exhibit spurious ambiguity, even “early update” could fail to ensure validity of update (see the example in figure 1). For validity of update, we propose a simple solution which is based on “early update” and which can accommodate spurious ambiguity. The basic idea is to use the correct action sequence which was 3 Following (Zhang and Nivre, 2012), we say the training algorithm is global if it optimizes the score of an entire action sequence. A local learner trains a classifier which distinguishes between single actions. 4 As shown in (Goldberg and Nivre 2012), most transition-based dependency parsers (Nivre et al., 2003; Huang and Sagae 2010;Zhang and Clark 2008) ignores spurious ambiguity by using a static oracle which maps a dependency tree to a single action sequence.

We use the standard split for dependency parsing and the split used by (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) for POS tagging. Penn2Malt5","is used to convert the bracketed structure into dependencies. For dependency parsing, POS tags of the training set are generated using 10-fold jack-knifing.","For Chinese, we use CTB 5.1 and the split suggested by (Duan et al., 2007) for both tagging and dependency parsing. We also use Penn2Malt and the head-finding rules of (Zhang and Clark 2008) to convert constituency trees into dependencies. For dependency parsing, we assume gold segmentation and POS tags for the input. 5 http://w3.msi.vxu.se/~nivre/research/Penn2Malt.html 112","Features used in English dependency parsing are listed in table 1. Besides the features in (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010), we also include some trigram features and valency features which are useful for transition-based dependency parsing (Zhang and Nivre, 2011). For English POS tagging, we use the same features as in (Shen et al., 2007). For Chinese POS tagging and dependency parsing, we use the same features as (Ma et al., 2012). All of our experiments are conducted on a Core i7 (2.93GHz) machine, both the tagger and parser are implemented using C++. 5.1 Effect of beam width Tagging/parsing performances with different beam widths on the development set are listed in table 2 and table 3. We can see that Chinese POS tagging, dependency parsing as well as English dependency parsing greatly benefit from beam search. While tagging accuracy on English only slightly improved. This may because that the accuracy of the greedy baseline tagger is already very high and it is hard to get further improvement. Table 2 and table 3 also show that the speed of both tagging and dependency parsing drops linearly with the growth of beam width. 5.2 Final results Tagging results on the test set together with some previous results are listed in table 4. Dependency parsing results on CTB and PTB are listed in table 5 and table 6, respectively.","On CTB, tagging accuracy of our greedy baseline is already comparable to the state-of-the-art. As the beam size grows to 5, tagging accuracy increases to 94.01% which is 2.3% error reduc-tion. This is also the best tagging accuracy comparing with previous single tagging models (For limited space, we do not list the performance of joint tagging-parsing models).","Parsing performances on both PTB and CTB are significantly improved with a relatively small beam width (s = 8). In particular, we achieve 86.33% uas on CTB which is 1.54% uas improvement over the greedy baseline parser. Moreover, the performance is better than the best transition-based parser (Zhang and Nivre, 2011) which adopts a much larger beam width (s = 64)."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and related work","paragraphs":["This work directly extends (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010) with beam search and global learning.
