However, infobox information is very incomplete and imbalanced among the Wikipedias in different languages. It is a promising but challenging problem to utilize the rich structured knowledge from a source language Wikipedia to help complete the missing infoboxes for a target language. In this paper, we formulate the problem of cross-lingual knowledge extraction from multilingual Wikipedia sources, and present a novel framework, called WikiCiKE, to solve this problem. An instance-based transfer learning method is utilized to overcome the problems of topic drift and translation errors. Our experimental results demonstrate that WikiCiKE outperforms the monolingual knowledge extraction method and the translation-based method."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In recent years, the automatic knowledge extraction using Wikipedia has attracted significant research interest in research fields, such as the semantic web. As a valuable source of structured knowledge, Wikipedia infoboxes have been utilized to build linked open data (Suchanek et al., 2007; Bollacker et al., 2008; Bizer et al., 2008; Bizer et al., 2009), support next-generation information retrieval (Hotho et al., 2006), improve question answering (Bouma et al., 2008; Ferrández et al., 2009), and other aspects of data exploitation (McIlraith et al., 2001; Volkel et al., 2006; Hogan et al., 2011) using semantic web standards, such as RDF (Pan and Horrocks, 2007; Heino and Pan, 2012) and OWL (Pan and Horrocks, 2006; Pan and Thomas, 2007; Fokoue et al., 2012), and their reasoning services.","However, most infoboxes in different Wikipedia language versions are missing. Figure 1 shows the statistics of article numbers and infobox information for six major Wikipedias. Only 32.82% of the articles have infoboxes on average, and the numbers of infoboxes for these Wikipedias vary significantly. For instance, the English Wikipedia has 13 times more infoboxes than the Chinese Wikipedia and 3.5 times more infoboxes than the second largest Wikipedia of German language. English German French Dutch Spanish Chinese0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 x 106 Languages Number of Instances   Article Infobox Figure 1: Statistics for Six Major Wikipedias.","To solve this problem, KYLIN has been proposed to extract the missing infoboxes from unstructured article texts for the English Wikipedia (Wu and Weld, 2007). KYLIN performs well when sufficient training data are available, and such techniques as shrinkage and retraining have been used to increase recall from English Wikipedia’s long tail of sparse infobox classes (Weld et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2008). The extraction performance of KYLIN is limited by the number of available training samples.","Due to the great imbalance between different Wikipedia language versions, it is difficult to gather sufficient training data from a single Wikipedia. Some translation-based cross-lingual knowledge 641 extraction methods have been proposed (Adar et al., 2009; Bouma et al., 2009; Adafre and de Rijke, 2006). These methods concentrate on translating existing infoboxes from a richer source language version of Wikipedia into the target language. The recall of new target infoboxes is highly limited by the number of equivalent cross-lingual articles and the number of existing source infoboxes. Take Chinese-English1","Wikipedias as an example: current translation-based methods only work for 87,603 Chinese Wikipedia articles, 20.43% of the total 428,777 articles. Hence, the challenge remains: how could we supplement the missing infoboxes for the rest 79.57% articles?","On the other hand, the numbers of existing infobox attributes in different languages are highly imbalanced. Table 1 shows the comparison of the numbers of the articles for the attributes in template PERSON between English and Chinese Wikipedia. Extracting the missing value for these attributes, such as awards, weight, influences and style, inside the single Chinese Wikipedia is intractable due to the rarity of existing Chinese attribute-value pairs.

In general, we address the problem of cross-lingual knowledge extraction by using the imbalance between Wikipedias of different languages. For each attribute, we aim to learn an extractor to find the missing value from the unstructured article texts in the target Wikipedia by using the rich information in the source language. Specifically, we treat this cross-lingual information extraction task as a transfer learning-based binary classification problem.","The contributions of this paper are as follows:","1. We propose a transfer learning-based cross-lingual knowledge extraction framework 1 Chinese-English denotes the task of Chinese Wikipedia","infobox completion using English Wikipedia called WikiCiKE. The extraction performance for the target Wikipedia is improved by using rich infoboxes and textual information in the source language.","2. We propose the TrAdaBoost-based extractor training method to avoid the problems of topic drift and translation errors of the source Wikipedia. Meanwhile, some language-independent features are introduced to make WikiCiKE as general as possible.","3. Chinese-English experiments for four typical attributes demonstrate that WikiCiKE outperforms both the monolingual extraction method and current translation-based method. The increases of 12.65% for precision and 12.47% for recall in the template named person are achieved when only 30 target training articles are available.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some basic concepts, the problem formalization and the overview of WikiCiKE. In Section 3, we propose our detailed approaches. We present our experiments in Section 4. Some related work is described in Section 5. We conclude our work and the future work in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Preliminaries","paragraphs":["In this section, we introduce some basic concepts regarding Wikipedia, formally defining the key problem of cross-lingual knowledge extraction and providing an overview of the WikiCiKE framework. 2.1 Wiki Knowledge Base and Wiki Article We consider each language version of Wikipedia as a wiki knowledge base, which can be represented as K = {ai}p","i=1, where ai is a disambiguated article in K and p is the size of K.","Formally we define a wiki article a ∈ K as a 5-tuple a = (title, text, i tp, C ), where • title denotes the title of the article a,","• text denotes the unstructured text description of the article a,","• ib is the infobox associated with a; specifically, ib = {(tr i, v i)}q","i=1 represents the list of attribute-value pairs for the article a, 642 Figure 2: Simplified Article of “Bill Gates”.","• tp = {tr i}r","i=1 is the infobox template associated with ib, where r is the number of attributes for one specific template, and","• C denotes the set of categories to which the article a belongs. Figure 2 gives an example of these five important elements concerning the article named “Bill Gates”.","In what follows, we will use named subscripts, such as aBill Gates, or index subscripts, such as ai, to refer to one particular instance interchangeably. We will use “name in TEMPLATE PERSON” to refer to the attribute tr name in the template tpP ERSON . In this cross-lingual task, we use the source (S) and target (T) languages to denote the languages of auxiliary and target Wikipedias, respectively. For example, KS indicates the source wiki knowledge base, and KT denotes the target wiki knowledge base. 2.2 Problem Formulation Mining new infobox information from unstructured article texts is actually a multi-template, multi-slot information extraction problem. In our task, each template represents an infobox template and each slot denotes an attribute. In the WikiCiKE framework, for each attribute tr T in an infobox template tpT , we treat the task of missing v extraction as a binary classification problem. It predicts whether a particular word (token) from the article text is the extraction target (Finn and Kushmerick, 2004; Lafferty et al., 2001). Given an attribute tr T and an instance","(word/token) xi, XS = {xi}n","i=1 and XT = {xi}n+m","i=n+1 are the sets of instances (words/tokens) in the source and the target language respectively. xi can be represented as a feature vector according to its context. Usually, we have n ≫ m in our set-ting, with much more attributes in the source that those in the target. The function g : X Y maps the instance from X = XS ∪ XT to the true label of Y = {0, 1}, where 1 represents the extraction target (positive) and 0 denotes the background information (negative). Because the number of target instances m is inadequate to train a good classifier, we combine the source and target instances to construct the training data set as T D = T DS ∪ T DT , where T DS = {xi, g(xi)}n","i=1 and T DT = {xi, g(xi)}n+m","i=n+1 represent the source and target training data, respectively.","Given the combined training data set T D, our objective is to estimate a hypothesis f : X Y that minimizes the prediction error on testing data in the target language. Our idea is to determine the useful part of T DS to improve the classification performance in T DT . We view this as a transfer learning problem. 2.3 WikiCiKE Framework WikiCiKE learns an extractor for a given attribute tr T in the target Wikipedia. As shown in Figure 3, WikiCiKE contains four key components: (1) Automatic Training Data Generation: given the target attribute tr T and two wiki knowledge bases KS and KT , WikiCiKE first generates the training data set T D = T DS ∪ T DT automatically. (2) WikiCiKE Training: WikiCiKE uses a transfer learning-based classification method to train the classifier (extractor) f : X Y by using T DS ∪ T DT . (3) Template Classification: WikiCiKE then determines proper candidate articles which are suitable to generate the missing value of tr T . (4) WikiCiKE Extraction: given a candidate article a, WikiCiKE uses the learned extractor f to label each word in the text of a, and generate the extraction result in the end."]},{"title":"3 Our Approach","paragraphs":["In this section, we will present the detailed approaches used in WikiCiKE. 643 Figure 3: WikiCiKE Framework. 3.1 Automatic Training Data Generation To generate the training data for the target attribute tr T , we first determine the equivalent cross-lingual attribute tr S. Fortunately, some templates in non-English Wikipedia (e.g. Chinese Wikipedia) explicitly match their attributes with their counterparts in English Wikipedia. Therefore, it is convenient to align the cross-lingual attributes using English Wikipedia as bridge. For attributes that can not be aligned in this way, currently we manually align them. The manual align-ment is worthwhile because thousands of articles belong to the same template may benefit from it and at the same time it is not very costly. In Chinese Wikipedia, the top 100 templates have covered nearly 80% of the articles which have been assigned a template.","Once the aligned attribute mapping tr T ↔ tr S is obtained, we collect the articles from both KS and KT containing the corresponding tr . The collected articles from KS are translated into the target language. Then, we use a uniform automatic method, which primarily consists of word labeling and feature vector generation, to generate the training data set T D = {(x, g(x))} from these collected articles.","For each collected article a = {title, text, i tp, C } and its v of tr , we can automatically label each word x in text according to whether x and its neighbors are contained by the v . The text and v are processed as bags of words {x}text and {x}value. Then for each xi ∈ {x}text we have: g(xi) =    1 xi ∈ {x}value, |{x}value| = 1 1 xi−1, xi ∈ {x}value or xi, xi+1 ∈ {x}value,","|{x}value| > 1 0 otherwise","(1)","After the word labeling, each instance (word/token) is represented as a feature vector. In this paper, we propose a general feature space that is suitable for most target languages. As shown in Table 2, we classify the features used in WikiCiKE into three categories: format features, POS tag features and token features.","Category Feature Example","Format First token of sentence ","","","","","feature Hello World!","In first half of sentence ","","","","","Hello World!","Starts with two digits 12","31","31th","Dec.","Starts with four digits 1999","","1999’s summer","Contains a cash sign 10","or 10$","Contains a percentage 10%","symbol","Stop words ,",",","","of, the, a, an","Pure number 365","Part of an anchor text ","","","Movie Director","Begin of an anchor text ","","","Game Designer","POS tag POS tag of current token","features POS tags of previous 5 tokens POS tags of next 5 tokens","Token Current token","features Previous 5 tokens Next 5 tokens Is current token contained by title Is one of previous 5 tokens contained by title Table 2: Feature Definition.","The target training data T DT is directly generated from articles in the target language Wikipedia. Articles from the source language Wikipedia are translated into the target language in advance and then transformed into training data T DS. In next section, we will discuss how to train an extractor from T D = T DS ∪ T DT . 3.2 WikiCiKE Training Given the attribute tr T , we want to train a classifier f : X Y that can minimize the prediction 644 error for the testing data in the target language. Traditional machine learning approaches attempt to determine f by minimizing some loss function L on the prediction f (x) for the training instance x and its real label g(x), which is","f̂ = argmin f∈Θ ∑ L(f(x), g(x)) where (x, g(x)) ∈ T DT","(2)","In this paper, we use TrAdaBoost (Dai et al., 2007), which is an instance-based transfer learning algorithm that was first proposed by Dai to find f̂ . TrAdaBoost requires that the source training instances XS and target training instances XT be drawn from the same feature space. In WikiCiKE, the source articles are translated into the target language in advance to satisfy this requirement. Due to the topic drift problem and translation errors, the joint probability distribution PS (x, g(x)) is not identical to PT (x, g(x)). We must adjust the source training data T DS so that they fit the distribution on T DT . TrAdaBoost iteratively updates the weights of all training instances to optimize the prediction error. Specifically, the weight-updating strategy for the source instances is decided by the loss on the target instances.","For each t = 1 ∼ T iteration, given a weight vector pt normalized from wt(wt is the weight vector before normalization), we call a basic classifier F that can address weighted instances and then find a hypothesis f that satisfies","f̂t = argmin f∈Θ","F ∑ L(pt, f(x), g(x)) (x, g(x)) ∈ T DS ∪ T DT (3) Let εt be the prediction error of f̂t at the tth","iteration on the target training instances T DT , which is εt = 1","∑n+m k=n+1 wt","k × n+m ∑","k=n+1(wt k × | f̂t(xk) − yk|) (4)","With εt, the weight vector wt is updated by the function: wt+1 = h(wt, εt) (5) The weight-updating strategy h is illustrated in Table 3. Finally, a final classifier f̂ can be obtained by combining f̂T/2 ∼ f̂T . TrAdaBoost has a convergence rate of O(√","ln(n/N )), where n and N are the number of source samples and number of maximum iterations respectively.","TrAdaBoost AdaBoost Target + wt wt samples − wt × β−1","t wt × β−1","t Source + wt × β−1","No source training samples − wt × β sample available +: correctly labelled −: miss-labelled wt: weight of an instance at the tth","iteration βt = εt × (1 − εt) β = 1/(1 + √ 2 ln nT ) Table 3: Weight-updating Strategy of TrAdaBoost. 3.3 Template Classification Before using the learned classifier f to extract missing infobox value for the target attribute tr T , we must select the correct articles to be processed. For example, the article aNew Y ork is not a proper article for extracting the missing value of the attribute tr birth day.","If a already has an incomplete infobox, it is clear that the correct tp is the template of its own infobox ib. For those articles that have no infoboxes, we use the classical 5-nearest neighbor algorithm to determine their templates (Roussopoulos et al., 1995) using their category labels, outlinks, inlinks as features (Wang et al., 2012). Our classifier achieves an average precision of 76.96% with an average recall of 63.29%, and can be improved further. In this paper, we concentrate on the WikiCiKE training and extraction components. 3.4 WikiCiKE Extraction Given an article a determined by template classification, we generate the missing v of tr from the corresponding text. First, we turn the text into a word sequence and compute the feature vector for each word based on the feature definition in Section 3.1. Next we use f to label each word, and we get a labeled sequence textl","as textl","= {xf(x1)","1 ...x f(xi−1) i−1 x f(xi) i x f(xi+1) i+1 ...x","f(xn)","n } where the superscript f (xi) ∈ {0, 1} represents the positive or negative label by f . After that, we extract the adjacent positive tokens in text as the predict value. In particular, the longest positive token sequence and the one that contains other positive token sequences are preferred in extraction. E.g., a positive sequence “comedy movie director” is preferred to a shorter sequence “movie director”. 645"]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["In this section, we present our experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of WikiCiKE, where we focus on the Chinese-English case; in other words, the target language is Chinese and the source language is English.

For each attribute, we collect both labeled articles (articles that contain the corresponding attribute tr ) and unlabeled articles in Chinese.

The difference between WikiCiKE and KE-Mon is that KE-Mon only uses the Chinese training data. 2 http://dumps.wikimedia.org/","2. KE-Tr is the translation-based extractor. It obtains the values by two steps: finding their counterparts (if available) in English using Wikipedia cross-lingual links and attribute alignments, and translating them into Chinese.","We conduct two series of evaluation to compare WikiCiKE with KE-Mon and KE-Tr, respectively.","1. We compare WikiCiKE with KE-Mon on the first testing data set Atest, where most values can be found in the articles’ texts in those labeled articles, in order to demonstrate the performance improvement by using cross-lingual knowledge transfer.","2. We compare WikiCiKE with KE-Tr on the second testing data set A′","test, where the existences of values are not guaranteed in those randomly selected articles, in order to demonstrate the better recall of WikiCiKE.","For implementation details, the weighted-SVM is used as the basic learner f both in WikiCiKE and KE-Mon (Zhang et al., 2009), and Baidu Translation API3","is used as the translator both in WikiCiKE and KE-Tr.

The reasons why the recall of KE-Tr is extremely low are two-fold. First, because of the limit of cross-lingual links and infoboxes in English Wikipedia, only a very small set of values is found by KE-Tr. Furthermore, many values obtained using the translator are incorrect because of translation errors.

Among all of the 72 attributes in TEMPLATE PERSON of Chinese Wikipedia, 39 (54.17%) and 55 (76.39%) attributes have less than 30 and 200 labeled articles respectively. We can see that WikiCiKE can save considerable human labor when no sufficient target training samples are available.","We also examined the errors by WikiCiKE and they can be categorized into three classes. For attribute ci when 30 target training samples are used, there are 71 errors. The first category is caused by incorrect word segmentation (40.85%). In Chinese, there is no space between words so we need to segment them before extraction. The result of word segmentation directly decide the performance of extraction so it causes most of the errors. The second category is because of the incomplete infoboxes (36.62%). In evaluation of KE-Mon, we directly use the values in infoboxex as golden values, some of them are incomplete so the correct predicted values will be automatically judged as the incorrect in these cases. The last category is mismatched words (22.54%). The predicted value does not match the golden value or a part of it. In the future, we can improve the performance of WikiCiKE by polish-ing the word segmentation result."]},{"title":"5 Related Work","paragraphs":["Some approaches of knowledge extraction from the open Web have been proposed (Wu et al., 2012; Yates et al., 2007). Here we focus on the extraction inside Wikipedia. 5.1 Monolingual Infobox Extraction KYLIN is the first system to autonomously extract the missing infoboxes from the corresponding article texts by using a self-supervised learning method (Wu and Weld, 2007). KYLIN performs well when enough training data are available. Such techniques as shrinkage and retraining are proposed to increase the recall from English Wikipedia’s long tail of sparse classes (Wu et al., 2008; Wu and Weld, 2010). Different from Wu’s research, WikiCiKE is a cross-lingual knowledge extraction framework, which leverags rich knowledge in the other language to improve extraction performance in the target Wikipedia. 5.2 Cross-lingual Infobox Completion Current translation based methods usually contain two steps: cross-lingual attribute alignmen-t and value translation. The attribute alignmen-t strategies can be grouped into two categories: cross-lingual link based methods (Bouma et al., 2009) and classification based methods (Adar et al., 2009; Nguyen et al., 2011; Aumueller et al., 2005; Adafre and de Rijke, 2006; Li et al., 2009). After the first step, the value in the source language is translated into the target language. E. Adar’s approach gives the overall precision of 54% and recall of 40% (Adar et al., 2009). However, recall of these methods is limited by the number of equivalent cross-lingual articles and the number of infoboxes in the source language. It is also limited by the quality of the translators. WikiCiKE attempts to mine the missing infoboxes directly from the article texts and thus achieves a higher recall compared with these methods as shown in Section 4.3. 5.3 Transfer Learning Transfer learning can be grouped into four categories: instance-transfer, feature-representation-transfer, parameter-transfer and relational-knowledge-transfer (Pan and Yang, 2010). TrAdaBoost, the instance-transfer approach, is an extension of the AdaBoost algorithm, and demonstrates better transfer ability than tradition-648 al learning techniques (Dai et al., 2007). Transfer learning have been widely studied for classification, regression, and cluster problems. However, few efforts have been spent in the information extraction tasks with knowledge transfer."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper we proposed a general cross-lingual knowledge extraction framework called WikiCiKE, in which extraction performance in the target Wikipedia is improved by using rich infoboxes in the source language.

In theory, WikiCiKE can be applied to any two wiki knowledge based of different languages.","We have been considering some future work. Firstly, more attributes in more infobox templates should be explored to make our results much stronger. Secondly, knowledge in a minor language may also help improve extraction performance for a major language due to the cultural and religion differences. A bidirectional cross-lingual extraction approach will also be studied. Last but not least, we will try to extract multiple attr-value pairs at the same time for each article.","Furthermore, our work is part of a more ambitious agenda on exploitation of linked data. On the one hand, being able to extract data and knowledge from multilingual sources such as Wikipedia could help improve the coverage of linked data for applications. On the other hand, we are also investigating how to possibly integrate information, including subjective information (Sensoy et al., 2013), from multiple sources, so as to better support data exploitation in context dependent applications."]},{"title":"Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["The work is supported by NSFC (No. 61035004), NSFC-ANR (No. 61261130588), 863 High Technology Program (2011AA01A207), FP7-288342, FP7 K-Drive project (286348), the EPSRC WhatIf project (EP/J014354/1) and THU-NUS NExT Co-Lab.
