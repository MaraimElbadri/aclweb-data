The central challenge is to automate every step of QA system construc-tion, including gathering large databases and answering questions against these databases. While there has been significant work on large-scale in-formation extraction (IE) from unstructured text (Banko et al., 2007; Hoffmann et al., 2010; Riedel et al., 2010), the problem of answering questions with the noisy knowledge bases that IE systems produce has received less attention. In this paper, we present an approach for learning to map questions to formal queries over a large, open-domain database of extracted facts (Fader et al., 2011).","Our system learns from a large, noisy, question-paraphrase corpus, where question clusters have a common but unknown query, and can span a diverse set of topics. Table 1 shows example paraphrase clusters for a set of factual questions. Such data provides strong signal for learning about lexical variation, but there are a number Who wrote the Winnie the Pooh books? Who is the author of winnie the pooh? What was the name of the authur of winnie the pooh? Who wrote the series of books for Winnie the poo? Who wrote the children’s storybook ‘Winnie the Pooh’? Who is poohs creator? What relieves a hangover? What is the best cure for a hangover? The best way to recover from a hangover? Best remedy for a hangover? What takes away a hangover? How do you lose a hangover? What helps hangover symptoms? What are social networking sites used for? Why do people use social networking sites worldwide? Advantages of using social network sites? Why do people use social networks a lot? Why do people communicate on social networking sites? What are the pros and cons of social networking sites? How do you say Santa Claus in Sweden? Say santa clause in sweden? How do you say santa clause in swedish? How do they say santa in Sweden? In Sweden what is santa called? Who is sweden santa? Table 1: Examples of paraphrase clusters from the WikiAnswers corpus. Within each cluster, there is a wide range of syntactic and lexical variations. of challenges. Given that the data is communityauthored, it will inevitably be incomplete, contain incorrectly tagged paraphrases, non-factual questions, and other sources of noise.","Our core contribution is a new learning approach that scalably sifts through this paraphrase noise, learning to answer a broad class of factual questions. We focus on answering open-domain questions that can be answered with single-relation queries, e.g. all of the paraphrases of “Who wrote Winnie the Pooh?” and “What cures a hangover?” in Table 1. The algorithm answers such questions by mapping them to executable queries over a tuple store containing relations such as authored(milne, winnie-the-pooh) and treat(bloody-mary, hangover-symptoms). 1608","The approach automatically induces lexical structures, which are combined to build queries for unseen questions. It learns lexical equivalences for relations (e.g., wrote, authored, and creator), entities (e.g., Winnie the Pooh or Pooh Bear), and question templates (e.g., Who r the e books? and Who is the r of e?). Crucially, the approach does not require any explicit labeling of the questions in our paraphrase corpus. Instead, we use 16 seed question templates and string-matching to find high-quality queries for a small subset of the questions. The algorithm uses learned word alignments to aggressively generalize the seeds, producing a large set of possible lexical equivalences. We then learn a linear ranking model to filter the learned lexical equivalences, keeping only those that are likely to answer questions well in practice.","Experimental results on 18 million paraphrase pairs gathered from WikiAnswers1","demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall approach. We performed an end-to-end evaluation against a database of 15 million facts automatically extracted from general web text (Fader et al., 2011). On known-answerable questions, the approach achieved 42% recall, with 77% precision, more than quadrupling the recall over a baseline system.","In sum, we make the following contributions:","• We introduce PARALEX, an end-to-end open-domain question answering system.","• We describe scalable learning algorithms that induce general question templates and lexical variants of entities and relations. These algorithms require no manual annotation and can be applied to large, noisy databases of relational triples.","• We evaluate PARALEX on the end-task of answering questions from WikiAnswers using a database of web extractions, and show that it outperforms baseline systems.","• We release our learned lexicon and question-paraphrase dataset to the research community, available at http://openie.cs.washington.edu."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Our work builds upon two major threads of research in natural language processing: informa-tion extraction (IE), and natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDB).","1","http://wiki.answers.com/","Research in IE has been moving towards the goal of extracting facts from large text corpora, across many domains, with minimal supervision (Mintz et al., 2009; Hoffmann et al., 2010; Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Banko et al., 2007; Yao et al., 2012). While much progress has been made in converting text into structured knowledge, there has been little work on answering natural language questions over these databases. There has been some work on QA over web text (Kwok et al., 2001; Brill et al., 2002), but these systems do not operate over extracted relational data.","The NLIDB problem has been studied for decades (Grosz et al., 1987; Katz, 1997). More recently, researchers have created systems that use machine learning techniques to automatically construct question answering systems from data (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Popescu et al., 2004; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Clarke et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2011). These systems have the ability to handle questions with complex semantics on small domain-specific databases like GeoQuery (Tang and Mooney, 2001) or subsets of Freebase (Cai and Yates, 2013), but have yet to scale to the task of general, open-domain question answering. In contrast, our system answers questions with more limited semantics, but does so at a very large scale in an open-domain manner. Some work has been made towards more general databases like DBpedia (Yahya et al., 2012; Unger et al., 2012), but these systems rely on hand-written templates for question interpretation.","The learning algorithms presented in this paper are similar to algorithms used for paraphrase extraction from sentence-aligned corpora (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Quirk et al., 2004; Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Callison-Burch, 2008; Marton et al., 2009). However, we use a paraphrase corpus for extracting lexical items relating natural language patterns to database concepts, as opposed to relationships between pairs of natural language utterances."]},{"title":"3 Overview of the Approach","paragraphs":["In this section, we give a high-level overview of the rest of the paper. Problem Our goal is to learn a function that will map a natural language question x to a query z over a database D. The database D is a collection of assertions in the form r(e1, e2) where r is a bi-1609 nary relation from a vocabulary R, and e1 and e2 are entities from a vocabulary E. We assume that the elements of R and E are human-interpretable strings like population or new-york. In our experiments, R and E contain millions of entries representing ambiguous and overlapping concepts. The database is equipped with a simple in-terface that accepts queries in the form r(?, e2) or r(e1, ?). When executed, these queries return all entities e that satisfy the given relationship. Thus, our task is to find the query z that best captures the semantics of the question x. Model The question answering model includes a lexicon and a linear ranking function. The lexicon L associates natural language patterns to database concepts, thereby defining the space of queries that can be derived from the input question (see Table 2). Lexical entries can pair strings with database entities (nyc and new-york), strings with database relations (big and population), or question patterns with templated database queries (how r is e? and r(?,e)). We describe this model in more detail in Section 4. Learning The learning algorithm induces a lexicon L and estimates the parameters θ of the linear ranking function. We learn L by bootstrapping from an initial seed lexicon L0 over a corpus of question paraphrases C = {(x, x′",") : x′","is a paraphrase of x}, like the examples in Table 1. We estimate θ by using the initial lexicon to automatically label queries in the paraphrase corpus, as described in Section 5.2. The final result is a scalable learning algorithm that requires no manual annotation of questions. Evaluation In Section 8, we evaluate our system against various baselines on the end-task of question answering against a large database of facts extracted from the web. We use held-out known-answerable questions from WikiAnswers as a test set."]},{"title":"4 Question Answering Model","paragraphs":["To answer questions, we must find the best query for a given natural language question. 4.1 Lexicon and Derivations To define the space of possible queries, PARALEX uses a lexicon L that encodes mappings from natural language to database concepts (entities, relations, and queries). Each entry in L is a pair (p, d) Entry Type NL Pattern DB Concept","Entity nyc new-york","Relation big population","Question (1-Arg.) how big is e population(?, e)","Question (2-Arg.) how r is e r(?, e) Table 2: Example lexical entries. where p is a pattern and d is an associated database concept. Table 2 gives examples of the entry types in L: entity, relation, and question patterns. Entity patterns match a contiguous string of words and are associated with some database entity e ∈ E. Relation patterns match a contiguous string of words and are associated with a relation r ∈ R and an argument ordering (e.g. the string child could be modeled as either parent-of or child-of with opposite argument ordering). Question patterns match an entire question string, with gaps that recursively match an entity or relation patterns. Question patterns are associated with a templated database query, where the values of the variables are determined by the matched entity and relation patterns. A question pattern may be 1-Argument, with a variable for an entity pattern, or 2-Argument, with variables for an entity pattern and a relation pattern. A 2-argument question pattern may also invert the argument order of the matched relation pattern, e.g. who r e? may have the opposite argument order of who did e r?","The lexicon is used to generate a derivation y from an input question x to a database query z. For example, the entries in Table 2 can be used to make the following derivation from the question How big is nyc? to the query population(?, new-york): This derivation proceeds in two steps: first match-ing a question form like How r is e? and then mapping big to population and nyc to new-york. Factoring the derivation this way allows the lexical entries for big and nyc to be reused in semanti-1610 cally equivalent variants like nyc how big is it? or approximately how big is nyc? This factorization helps the system generalize to novel questions that do not appear in the training set.","We model a derivation as a set of (pi, di) pairs, where each pi matches a substring of x, the substrings cover all words in x, and the database concepts di compose to form z. Derivations are rooted at either a 1-argument or 2-argument question entry and have entity or relation entries as leaves. 4.2 Linear Ranking Function In general, multiple queries may be derived from a single input question x using a lexicon L. Many of these derivations may be incorrect due to noise in L. Given a question x, we consider all derivations y and score them with θ · φ(x, y), where φ(x, y) is a n-dimensional feature representation and θ is a n-dimensional parameter vector. Let GEN(x; L) be the set of all derivations y that can be generated from x using L. The best derivation y∗","(x) accord-ing to the model (θ, L) is given by:","y∗ (x) = arg max","y∈GEN(x;L) θ · φ(x, y) The best query z∗","(x) can be computed directly from the derivation y∗","(x).","Computing the set GEN(x; L) involves finding all 1-Argument and 2-Argument question patterns that match x, and then enumerating all possible database concepts that match entity and relation strings. When the database and lexicon are large, this becomes intractable. We prune GEN(x; L) using the model parameters θ by only considering the N -best question patterns that match x, before additionally enumerating any relations or entities.","For the end-to-end QA task, we return a ranked list of answers from the k highest scoring queries. We score an answer a with the highest score of all derivations that generate a query with answer a."]},{"title":"5 Learning","paragraphs":["PARALEX uses a two-part learning algorithm; it first induces an overly general lexicon (Section 5.1) and then learns to score derivations to increase accuracy (Section 5.2).

In the next section, we will introduce a scalable approach for learning to score derivations to filter out lexical items that generalize poorly. 5.2 Parameter Learning Parameter learning is necessary for filtering out derivations that use incorrect lexical entries like new mexico = mexico, which arise from noise in the paraphrases and noise in the word alignment. 2","InduceLex has similar behavior for the other type of derivation, which consists of a 1-argument question entry (pq, dq) and an entity (pe, de). We use the hidden variable structured perceptron algorithm to learn θ from a list of (question x, query z) training examples. We adopt the iterative parameter mixing variation of the perceptron (McDonald et al., 2010) to scale to a large number of training examples.","Figure 2 shows the parameter learning algorithm. The parameter learning algorithm operates in two stages. First, we use the initial lexicon L0 to automatically generate (question x, query z) training examples from the paraphrase corpus C.

We evaluate the systems’ performance on the end-task of QA on WikiAnswers questions. 7.1 Test Set A major challenge for evaluation is that the REVERB database is incomplete. A system may correctly map a test question to a valid query, only to return 0 results when executed against the in-complete database. We factor out this source of error by semi-automatically constructing a sample of questions that are known to be answerable using the REVERB database, and thus allows for a meaningful comparison on the task of question understanding.","To create the evaluation set, we identified questions x in a held out portion of the WikiAnswers corpus such that (1) x can be mapped to some query z using an initial lexicon (described in Section 7.4), and (2) when z is executed against the database, it returns at least one answer. We then add x and all of its paraphrases as our evaluation set. For example, the question What is the language of Hong-Kong satisfies these requirements, so we added these questions to the evaluation set:","What is the language of Hong-Kong?","What language do people in hong kong use?","How many languages are spoken in hong kong?","How many languages hong kong people use?","In Hong Kong what language is spoken?","Language of Hong-kong? This methodology allows us to evaluate the systems’ ability to handle syntactic and lexical variations of questions that should have the same answers. We created 37 question clusters, resulting in a total of 698 questions. We removed all of these questions and their paraphrases from the training set. We also manually filtered out any incorrect paraphrases that appeared in the test clusters.","We then created a gold-standard set of (x, a, l) triples, where x is a question, a is an answer, and l 1613","Question Pattern Database Query","who r e r(?, e)","what r e r(?, e) who does e r r(e, ?) what does e r r(e, ?)","what is the r of e r(?, e)","who is the r of e r(?, e) what is r by e r(e, ?) who is e’s r r(?, e) what is e’s r r(?, e) who is r by e r(e, ?) when did e r r-in(e, ?) when did e r r-on(e, ?) when was e r r-in(e, ?) when was e r r-on(e, ?) where was e r r-in(e, ?) where did e r r-in(e, ?)

To create the gold-standard, we first ran each system on the evaluation questions to generate (x, a) pairs. Then we manually tagged each pair with a label l. This resulted in a set of approximately 2, 000 human judgments. If (x, a) was tagged with label l and x′ is a paraphrase of x, we automatically added the labeling (x′",", a, l), since questions in the same cluster should have the same answer sets. This process resulted in a gold standard set of approximately 48, 000 (x, a, l) triples. 7.2 Metrics We use two types of metrics to score the systems. The first metric measures the precision and recall of each system’s highest ranked answer. Precision is the fraction of predicted answers that are correct and recall is the fraction of questions where a correct answer was predicted. The second metric measures the accuracy of the entire ranked answer set returned for a question. We compute the mean average precision (MAP) of each systems’ output, which measures the average precision over all levels of recall. 7.3 Features and Settings The feature representation φ(x, y) consists of in-dicator functions for each lexical entry (p, d) ∈ L used in the derivation y.

The largest group (14%) were questions that need n-ary or higher-order database relations, for example How long does it take to drive from Sacramento to Cancun? or What do cats and dogs have in common? Approximately 13% of the questions were how-to questions like How do you make axes in minecraft? whose answers are a sequence of steps, instead of a database entity. Lastly, 9% of the questions require database operators like joins, for example When were Bobby Orr’s children born?","The second largest source of error (32%) were questions that could be represented as a query, but where PARALEX was unable to derive any correct queries. For example, the question Things grown on Nigerian farms? was not mapped to any queries, even though the REVERB database contains the relation grown-in and the entity nigeria. We found that 13% of the incorrect questions were cases where the entity was not recognized, 12% were cases where the relation was not recognized, and 6% were cases where both the entity and relation were not recognized.","We found that 28% of the errors were cases where PARALEX derived a query that we judged to be correct, but returned no answers when executed against the database. For example, given the question How much can a dietician earn? PARALEX derived the query salary-of(?, dietician) but this returned no answers in the REVERB database.","Finally, approximately 4% of the questions in-cluded typos or were judged to be inscrutable, for example Barovier hiriacy of evidence based for pressure sore? Discussion Our experiments show that the learning algorithms described in Section 5 allow PARALEX to generalize beyond an initial lexicon and answer questions with significantly higher accuracy. Our error analysis on an unrestricted set of WikiAnswers questions shows that PARALEX is still far from the goal of truly high-recall, open-domain QA. We found that many questions asked on WikiAnswers are either too complex to be mapped to a simple relational query, or are not covered by the REVERB database. Further, approximately one third of the missing recall is due to entity and relation recognition errors.","Incorrectly Answered/Unanswered Questions","36% Complex Questions Need n-ary or higher-order relations (14%) Answer is a set of instructions (13%) Need database operators e.g. joins (9%)","32% Entity or Relation Recognition Errors Entity recognition errors (13%) Relation recognition errors (12%) Entity & relation recognition errors (7%)","28% Incomplete Database Derived a correct query, but no answers","4% Typos/Inscrutable Questions Table 8: Error distribution of PARALEX on an unrestricted sample of questions from the WikiAnswers dataset."]},{"title":"10 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We introduced a new learning approach that induces a complete question-answering system from a large corpus of noisy question-paraphrases. Using only a seed lexicon, the approach automatically learns a lexicon and linear ranking function that demonstrated high accuracy on a held-out evaluation set.","A number of open challenges remain. First, precision could likely be improved by adding new features to the ranking function. Second, we would like to generalize the question understanding framework to produce more complex queries, constructed within a compositional semantic framework, but without sacrificing scalability. Third, we would also like to extend the system with other large databases like Freebase or DBpedia. Lastly, we believe that it would be possible to leverage the user-provided answers from WikiAnswers as a source of supervision."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This research was supported in part by ONR grant N00014-11-1-0294, DARPA contract FA8750-09-C-0179, a gift from Google, a gift from Vulcan Inc., and carried out at the University of Washington’s Turing Center.
