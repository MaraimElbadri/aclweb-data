Finding the optimal model parameters is then usually a difficult nonconvex optimization problem. The usual practice is to settle for local optimization methods such as EM or gradient ascent. We explore how one might instead search for a global optimum in parameter space, using branch-and-bound. Our method would eventually find the global maximum (up to a user-specified ε) if run for long enough, but at any point can return a suboptimal solution together with an upper bound on the global maximum. As an illustrative case, we study a generative model for dependency parsing. We search for the maximum-likelihood model parameters and corpus parse, subject to posterior constraints. We show how to for-mulate this as a mixed integer quadratic programming problem with nonlinear constraints.

The node with a local bound of -467.5 can be pruned because no solution within its subspace could be better than the incumbent. dency grammar induction). This may be a particularly hard case, but its structure is typical. Many parameter estimation techniques have been attempted, including expectation-maximization (EM) (Klein and Manning, 2004; Spitkovsky et al., 2010a), contrastive estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2006; Smith, 2006), Viterbi EM (Spitkovsky et al., 2010b), and variational EM (Naseem et al., 2010; Cohen et al., 2009; Cohen and Smith, 2009). These are all local search techniques, which improve the parameters by hill-climbing.","The problem with local search is that it gets stuck in local optima. This is evident for grammar induction. An algorithm such as EM will find numerous different solutions when randomly initialized to different points (Charniak, 1993; Smith, 2006). A variety of ways to find better local optima have been explored, including heuristic initialization of the model parameters (Spitkovsky et al., 2010a), random restarts (Smith, 2006), and annealing (Smith and Eisner, 2006; Smith, 2006). Others have achieved accuracy improve-ments by enforcing linguistically motivated posterior constraints on the parameters (Gillenwater et al., 2010; Naseem et al., 2010), such as requiring most sentences to have verbs or encouraging nouns to be children of verbs or prepositions. We introduce a method that performs global 444 search with certificates of ε-optimality for both the corpus parse and the model parameters. Our search objective is log-likelihood. We can also impose posterior constraints on the latent structure.","As we show, maximizing the joint log-likelihood of the parses and the parameters can be formulated as a mathematical program (MP) with a nonconvex quadratic objective and with integer linear and nonlinear constraints. Note that this objective is that of hard (Viterbi) EM—we do not marginalize over the parses as in classical EM.1","To globally optimize the objective function, we employ a branch-and-bound algorithm that searches the continuous space of the model parameters by branching on individual parameters (see Figure 1). Thus, our branch-and-bound tree serves to recursively subdivide the global parameter hypercube. Each node represents a search problem over one of the resulting boxes (i.e., orthotopes).","The crucial step is to prune nodes high in the tree by determining that their boxes cannot contain the global maximum. We compute an upper bound at each node by solving a relaxed maximization problem tailored to its box. If this upper bound is worse than our current best solution, we can prune the node. If not, we split the box again via another branching decision and retry on the two halves.","At each node, our relaxation derives a linear programming problem (LP) that can be efficiently solved by the dual simplex method. First, we linearly relax the constraints that grammar rule probabilities sum to 1—these constraints are nonlinear in our parameters, which are log-probabilities. Second, we linearize the quadratic objective by applying the Reformulation Linearization Technique (RLT) (Sherali and Adams, 1990), a method of forming tight linear relaxations of various types of MPs: the reformulation step multiplies together pairs of the original linear constraints to generate new quadratic constraints, and then the linearization step replaces quadratic terms in the new constraints with auxiliary variables.","Finally, if the node is not pruned, we search for a better incumbent solution under that node by projecting the solution of the RLT relaxation back onto the feasible region. In the relaxation, the model parameters might sum to slightly more than","1","This objective might not be a great sacrifice: Spitkovsky et al. (2010b) present evidence that hard EM can outperform soft EM for grammar induction in a hill-climbing setting. We use it because it is a quadratic objective. However, maximizing it remains NP-hard (Cohen and Smith, 2010). one and the parses can consist of fractional dependency edges. We project in order to compute the true objective and compare with other solutions.","Our results demonstrate that our method can obtain higher likelihoods than Viterbi EM with random restarts. Furthermore, we show how posterior constraints inspired by Gillenwater et al. (2010) and Naseem et al. (2010) can easily be applied in our framework to obtain competitive accuracies using a simple model, the Dependency Model with Valence (Klein and Manning, 2004). We also obtain an ε-optimal solution on a toy dataset.","We caution that the linear relaxations are very loose on larger boxes. Since we have many dimensions, the binary branch-and-bound tree may have to grow quite deep before the boxes become small enough to prune. This is why nonconvex quadratic optimization by LP-based branch-and-bound usually fails with more than 80 variables (Burer and Vandenbussche, 2009). Even our smallest (toy) problems have hundreds of variables, so our experimental results mainly just illuminate the method’s behavior. Nonetheless, we offer the method as a new tool which, just as for local search, might be combined with other forms of problem-specific guidance to produce more practical results."]},{"title":"2 The Constrained Optimization Task","paragraphs":["We begin by describing how for our typical model, the Viterbi EM objective can be formulated as a mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem with nonlinear constraints (Figure 2).","Other locally normalized log-linear generative models (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010) would have a similar formulation. In such models, the log-likelihood objective is simply a linear function of the feature counts. However, the objective be-comes quadratic in unsupervised learning, because the feature counts are themselves unknown variables to be optimized. The feature counts are constrained to be derived from the latent variables (e.g., parses), which are unknown discrete structures that must be encoded with integer variables. The nonlinear constraints ensure that the model parameters are true log-probabilities.","Concretely, (1) specifies the Viterbi EM objective: the total log-probability of the best parse trees under the parameters θ, given by a sum of log-probabilities θm of the individual steps needed to generate the tree, as encoded by the features fm.

This generative model defines a joint distribution over the sentences and their dependency trees.","We encode the DMV using integer linear constraints on the arc variables e and feature counts f . These will constitute the model constraints in (3). The constraints must declaratively specify that the arcs form a valid dependency tree and that the resulting feature values are as defined by the DMV. Tree Constraints To ensure that our arc variables, es, form a dependency tree, we employ the same single-commodity flow constraints of Magnanti and Wolsey (1994) as adapted by Martins et al. (2009) for parsing. We also use the projectivity constraints of Martins et al. (2009).","The single-commodity flow constraints simultaneously enforce that each node has exactly one parent, the special root node (position 0) has no in-coming arcs, and the arcs form a connected graph.","For each sentence, s, the variable φsij indicates the amount of flow traversing the arc from i to j in sentence s. The constraints below specify that the root node emits Ns units of flow (5), that one unit of flow is consumed by each each node (6), that the flow is zero on each disabled arc (7), and that the arcs are binary variables (8).","Single-commodity flow (Magnanti & Wolsey, 1994) Ns ∑ j=1 φs0j = Ns, ∀j (5) Ns ∑ i=0 φsij − Ns ∑ k=1 φsjk = 1, ∀j (6) φsij ≤ Nsesij, ∀i, j (7) esij ∈ {0, 1}, ∀i, j (8)","Projectivity is enforced by adding a constraint (9) for each arc ensuring that no edges will cross that arc if it is enabled.

First the head word of the sentence is generated, t ∼ Discrete(θroot), where θroot is a subvector of θ.

The standard approach to optimizing this program is local search by the hard (Viterbi) EM algorithm. Yet local search can only provide a lower (pessimistic) bound on the global maximum.","We propose a branch-and-bound algorithm, which will iteratively tighten both pessimistic and optimistic bounds on the optimal solution. This algorithm may be halted at any time, to obtain the best current solution and a bound on how much better the global optimum could be.","A feasible solution is an assignment to all the variables—both model parameters and corpus parse—that satisfies all constraints. Our branch-and-bound algorithm maintains an incumbent solution: the best known feasible solution according to the objective function. This is updated as better feasible solutions are found.","Our algorithm implicitly defines a search tree in which each node corresponds to a region of model parameter space. Our search procedure begins with only the root node, which represents the full model parameter space. At each node we perform three steps: bounding, projecting, and branching.","In the bounding step, we solve a relaxation of the original problem to provide an upper bound on the objective achievable within that node’s subregion. A node is pruned when Lglobal + ε|Lglobal| ≥ Ulocal, where Lglobal is the incumbent score, Ulocal is the upper bound for the node, and ε > 0. This ensures that its entire subregion will not yield a ε-better solution than the current incumbent.","The overall optimistic bound is given by the worst optimistic bound of all current leaf nodes.","The projecting step, if the node is not pruned, projects the solution of the relaxation back to the feasible region, replacing the current incumbent if this projection provides a better lower bound.","In the branching step, we choose a variable θm on which to divide.

This upper bound would ideally be not much greater than the true maximum achievable on that region, but looser upper bounds are gener-ally faster to compute. 447","We present successive relaxations to the original nonconvex mixed integer quadratic program with nonlinear constraints from (1)–(4). First, we show how the nonlinear sum-to-one constraints can be relaxed into linear constraints and tight-ened. Second, we apply a classic approach to bound the nonconvex quadratic objective by a linear concave envelope. Finally, we present our full relaxation based on the Reformulation Linearization Technique (RLT) (Sherali and Adams, 1990). We solve these LPs by the dual simplex algorithm. 4.1 Relaxing the sum-to-one constraint In this section, we use cutting planes to create a linear relaxation for the sum-to-one constraint (2). When relaxing a constraint, we must ensure that any assignment of the variables that was feasible (i.e. respected the constraints) in the original problem must also be feasible in the relaxation. In most cases, the relaxation is not perfectly tight and so will have an enlarged space of feasible solutions.","We begin by weakening constraint (2) to","∑ m∈Mc exp(θm) ≤ 1 (17) The optimal solution under (17) still satisfies the original equality constraint (2) because of the maximization.

Instead of requiring z ≤ 1, we only require each of these lower bounds to be ≤ 1, slightly enlarging the feasible space into a convex polytope.

The shaded area shows the enlarged feasible region under the linear relaxation. In (b), the curved lower surface represents a single product term in the objective. The piecewise-linear upper surface is its concave envelope (raised by 20 for illustration; in reality they touch). were fixed, the objective would become linear in the latent features. Although the parameters are not fixed, the branch-and-bound algorithm does box them into a small region, where the quadratic objective is “more linear.”","Since it is easy to maximize a concave function, we will maximize the concave envelope—the concave function that most tightly upper-bounds our objective over the region.

The basic method reformulates the problem by adding products of existing constraints. The quadratic terms in the objective and in these new constraints are redefined as auxiliary variables, thereby linearizing the program.","In this section, we will show how the RLT can be applied to our grammar induction problem and contrast it with the concave envelope relaxation presented in section 4.2.","Consider the original MP in equations (1) - (4), with the nonlinear sum-to-one constraints in (2) replaced by our linear constraints proposed in (18).

It has since been extended to various other settings; see Sherali and Liberti (2008) for a complete survey. 3","In the general case, that Q is indefinite causes this program to be nonconvex, making this problem NP-hard to solve (Vavasis, 1991; Pardalos, 1991).

However, the same technique can be applied repeatedly to produce polynomial constraints of higher degree. These higher level constraints/variables have been shown to provide increasingly tighter relaxations (Sherali and Adams, 1990) at the cost of a large number of variables and constraints. In the case where x ∈ {0, 1}n","the degree-n RLT constraints will restrict to the convex hull of the feasible solutions (Sherali and Adams, 1990).","This is in direct contrast to the concave envelope relaxation presented in section 4.2 which relaxes to the convex hull of each quadratic term in-dependently. This demonstrates the key intuition of the RLT relaxation: The products of constraints are implied (and unnecessary) in the original variable space. Yet when we project to a higher-dimentional space by including the auxiliary variables, the linearized constraints cut off portions of the feasible region given by only the concave envelope relaxation in eqs. (20)-(21) . 449 4.4 Adding Posterior Constraints It is a simple extension to impose posterior constraints within our framework. Here we emphasize constraints that are analogous to the universal linguistic constraints from Naseem et al. (2010). Since we optimize the Viterbi EM objective, we directly constrain the counts in the single corpus parse rather than expected counts from a distribution over parses.

We propose several methods for obtaining pessimistic bounds during the branch-and-bound search, by projecting and improving the solutions found by the relaxation. A solution to the relaxation may be infea-sible in the original problem for two reasons: the model parameters might not sum to one, and/or the parse may contain fractional edges. Model Parameters For each set of model parameters Mc that should sum-to-one, we project the model parameters onto the Mc − 1 simplex by one of two methods: (1) normalize the infeasi-ble parameters or (2) find the point on the simplex that has minimum Euclidean distance to the infea-sible parameters using the algorithm of Chen and Ye (2011). For both methods, we can optionally apply add-λ smoothing before projecting. Parses Since we are interested in projecting the fractional parse onto the space of projective spanning trees, we can simply employ a dynamic programming parsing algorithm (Eisner and Satta, 1999) where the weight of each edge is given as the fraction of the edge variable.","Only one of these projection techniques is needed. We then either use parsing to fill in the optimal parse trees given the projected model parameters, or use supervised parameter estimation to fill in the optimal model parameters given the projected parses. These correspond to the Viterbi E step and M step, respectively. We can locally improve the projected solution by continuing with a few additional iterations of Viterbi EM.","Related models could use very similar projection techniques. Given a relaxed joint solution to the parameters and the latent variables, one must be able to project it to a nearby feasible one, by projecting either the fractional parameters or the fractional latent variables into the feasible space and then solving exactly for the other."]},{"title":"6 Related Work","paragraphs":["The goal of this work was to better understand and address the non-convexity of maximum-likelihood training with latent variables, especially parses.","Gimpel and Smith (2012) proposed a concave model for unsupervised dependency parsing using IBM Model 1.

Hsu et al. (2009) introduced a spectral learner for a large class of HMMs. For supervised parsing, spectral learning has been used to learn latent variable PCFGs (Cohen et al., 2012) and hidden-state dependency grammars (Luque et al., 2012). Alas, there are not yet any spectral learning methods that recover latent tree structure, as in grammar induction.","Several integer linear programming (ILP) formulations of dependency parsing (Riedel and Clarke, 2006; Martins et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2012) inspired our definition of grammar induction as a MP.

For just 20 sentences from this synthetic model, the RLT generates 4,056,498 constraints.","For a single run of branch-and-bound, Figure 5 shows the global upper and lower bounds over time.5","We consider five relaxations, each using only a subset of the RLT constraints.

RLT Max.0k achieves the best balance of tight bounds and speed per node. 7.2 Comparing branch-and-bound strategies It is prohibitively expensive to repeatedly run our algorithm to completion with a variety of parameter settings. Instead, we estimate the size of the branch-and-bound tree and the solution time using a high-variance estimate that is effective for comparisons (Lobjois and Lemaı̂tre, 1998).","Given a fixed set of parameters for our algorithm and an ε-optimality stopping criterion, we 451 RLT Relaxation Avg. ms per node # Sam-ples Est. # Nodes","Est. #","Hours Obj.Filter 63 10000 3.2E+08 4.6E+09 Max.0k 6 10000 1.7E+10 7.8E+10 Max.1k 15 10000 3.5E+08 4.2E+09 Max.10k 161 10000 1.3E+09 3.4E+10 Max.100k 232259 5 1.7E+09 9.7E+13 Table 1: Branch-and-bound node count and completion time estimates.

Letting f (α) = 1 estimates the number of nodes; if f (α) is the time to solve a node, then we estimate the total solution time using the Monte Carlo method of Knuth (1975). Table 1 gives these estimates, for the same five RLT relaxations. Obj.Filter yields the smallest estimated tree size. 7.3 Real Data In this section, we compare our global search method to Viterbi EM with random restarts each with or without posterior constraints. We use 200 sentences of no more than 10 tokens from the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank. We reduce the tree-bank’s gold part-of-speech (POS) tags to a universal set of 12 tags (Petrov et al., 2012) plus a tag for auxiliaries, ignoring punctuation. Each search method is run for 8 hours. We obtain the initial incumbent solution for branch-and-bound by running Viterbi EM for 45 minutes. The average time to solve a node’s relaxation ranges from 3 seconds for RLT Max.0k to 42 seconds for RLT Max.100k.","Figure 6a shows the log-likelihood of the incumbent solution over time. In our global search method, like Viterbi EM, the posterior constraints lead to lower log-likelihoods. RLT Max.0k finds the highest log-likelihood solution.","Figure 6b compares the unlabeled directed dependency accuracy of the incumbent solution. In both global and local search, the posterior constraints lead to higher accuracies. Viterbi EM with posterior constraints demonstrates the oscillation of incumbent accuracy: starting at 58.02% accuracy, it finds several high accuracy solutions early on (61.02%), but quickly abandons them to increase likelihood, yielding a final accuracy of 60.65%.

The method can also be used with posterior constraints or a regularized objective.","Future work includes algorithmic improve-ments for solving the relaxation and the development of tighter relaxations. The Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition (Dantzig and Wolfe, 1960) or Lagrangian Relaxation (Held and Karp, 1970) might satisfy both of these goals by pushing the integer tree constraints into a subproblem solved by a dynamic programming parser. Recent work on semidefinite relaxations (Anstreicher, 2009) suggests they may provide tighter bounds at the expense of greater computation time.","Perhaps even more important than tightening the bounds at each node are search heuristics (e.g., surface cues) and priors (e.g., universal grammar) that guide our global search by deciding which node to expand next (Chomsky and Lasnik, 1993). 452"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Tobias Achterberg. 2007.
