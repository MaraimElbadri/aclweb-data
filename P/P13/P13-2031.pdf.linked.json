Similarly to multi-view learning, the “segmentation agreements” between the two different types of view are used to overcome the scarcity of the label information on unlabeled data. The proposed approach train-s a character-based and word-based model on labeled data, respectively, as the initial models. Then, the two models are constantly updated using unlabeled examples, where the learning objective is maximiz-ing their segmentation agreements. The agreements are regarded as a set of valuable constraints for regularizing the learning of both models on unlabeled data. The segmentation for an input sentence is decod-ed by using a joint scoring function combining the two induced models. The evaluation on the Chinese tree bank reveals that our model results in better gains over the state-of-the-art semi-supervised models reported in the literature."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is a critical and a necessary initial procedure with respect to the majority of high-level Chinese language processing tasks such as syntax parsing, information extraction and machine translation, since Chinese scripts are written in continuous characters without explicit word boundaries. Although supervised CWS models (Xue, 2003; Zhao et al., 2006; Zhang and Clark, 2007; Sun, 2011) proposed in the past years showed some reasonably accurate results, the outstanding problem is that they rely heavily on a large amount of labeled data. However, the production of segmented Chinese texts is time-consuming and expensive, since hand-labeling individual words and word boundaries is very hard (Jiao et al., 2006). So, one can-not rely only on the manually segmented data to build an everlasting model. This naturally provides motivation for using easily accessible raw texts to enhance supervised CWS models, in semi-supervised approaches. In the past years, however, few semi-supervised CWS models have been proposed. Xu et al. (2008) described a Bayesian semi-supervised model by considering the segmentation as the hidden variable in machine translation. Sun and Xu (2011) enhanced the segmentation results by interpolating the statistics-based features derived from unlabeled data to a CRFs model. An-other similar trial via “feature engineering” was conducted by Wang et al. (2011).","The crux of solving semi-supervised learning problem is the learning on unlabeled data. In-spired by multi-view learning that exploits redundant views of the same input data (Ganchev et al., 2008), this paper proposes a semi-supervised CWS model of co-regularizing from two different views (intrinsically two different models), character-based and word-based, on unlabeled data. The motivation comes from that the two types of model exhibit different strengths and they are mutually complementary (Sun, 2010; Wang et al., 2010). The proposed approach begins by training a character-based and word-based model on labeled data respectively, and then both models are regularized from each view by their segmentation agreements, i.e., the identical outputs, of unlabeled data. This paper introduces segmentation agreements as gainful knowledge for guiding the learning on the texts without label information. Moreover, in order to better combine the strengths of the two models, the proposed approach uses a joint scoring function in a log-linear combination form for the decoding in the segmentation phase. 171"]},{"title":"2 Segmentation Models","paragraphs":["There are two classes of CWS models: character-based and word-based. This section briefly re-views two supervised models in these categories, a character-based CRFs model, and a word-based Perceptrons model, which are used in our approach. 2.1 Character-based CRFs Model Character-based models treat word segmentation as a sequence labeling problem, assigning label-s to the characters in a sentence indicating their positions in a word. A 4 tag-set is used in this paper: B (beginning), M (middle), E (end) and S (single character). Xue (2003) first proposed the use of CRFs model (Lafferty et al., 2001) in character-based CWS. Let x = (x1","x2","...x|x|",") ∈ X denote a sentence, where each character and y = (y1","y2","...y|y|",") ∈ Y denote a tag sequence, yi","∈ T being the tag assigned to xi",". The goal is to achieve a label sequence with the best score in the form, pθc(y|x) =","1 Z(x; θc) exp{f (x, y) · θc} (1) where Z(x; θc) is a partition function that normalizes the exponential form to be a probability distribution, and f (x, y) are arbitrary feature functions. The aim of CRFs is to estimate the weight parameters θc that maximizes the conditional likelihood of the training data:","θ̂c = argmax θc l ∑ i=1","log pθc(yi |xi",") − γ∥θ","c∥2 2 (2) where γ∥θc∥2","2 is a regularizer on parameters to limit overfitting on rare features and avoid degeneracy in the case of correlated features. In this paper, this objective function is optimized by s-tochastic gradient method. For the decoding, the Viterbi algorithm is employed. 2.2 Word-based Perceptrons Model Word-based models read a input sentence from left to right and predict whether the current piece of continuous characters is a word. After one word is identified, the method moves on and searches for a next possible word. Zhang and Clark (2007) first proposed a word-based segmentation model using a discriminative Perceptrons algorithm. Given a sentence x, let us denote a possible segmented sentence as w ∈ w, and the function that enumerates a set of segmentation candidates as GEN:w = GEN(x) for x. The objective is to maximize the following problem for all sentences:","θ̂w = argmax w=GEN(x) |w| ∑ i=1 φ(x, wi) · θw (3) where it maps the segmented sentence w to a global feature vector φ and denotes θw as its corresponding weight parameters. The parameters θw can be estimated by using the Perceptrons method (Collins, 2002) or other online learning algorithms, e.g., Passive Aggressive (Crammer et al., 2006). For the decoding, a beam search decoding method (Zhang and Clark, 2007) is used. 2.3 Comparison Between Both Models Character-based and word-based models present different behaviors and each one has its own strengths and weakness. Sun (2010) carried out a thorough survey that includes theoretical and empirical comparisons from four aspects. Here, two critical properties of the two models supporting the co-regularization in this study are highlight-ed. Character-based models present better predic-tion ability for new words, since they lay more emphasis on the internal structure of a word and thereby express more nonlinearity. On the other side, it is easier to define the word-level features in word-based models. Hence, these models have a greater representational power and consequently better recognition performance for in-of-vocabulary (IV) words."]},{"title":"3 Semi-supervised Learning via Co-regularizing Both Models","paragraphs":["As mentioned earlier, the primary challenge of semi-supervised CWS concentrates on the unlabeled data. Obviously, the learning on unlabeled data does not come for “free”. Very often, it is necessary to discover certain gainful information, e.g., label constraints of unlabeled data, that is in-corporated to guide the learner toward a desired solution. In our approach, we believe that the segmentation agreements (§ 3.1) from two different views, character-based and word-based models, can be such gainful information. Since each of the models has its own merits, their consensuses signify high confidence segmentations. This naturally leads to a new learning objective that maximizes segmentation agreements between two models on unlabeled data. 172","This study proposes a co-regularized CWS model based on character-based and word-based models, built on a small amount of segmented sentences (labeled data) and a large amount of raw sentences (unlabeled data). The model induction process is described in Algorithm 1: given labeled dataset Dl and unlabeled dataset Du, the first two steps are training a CRFs (character-based) and Perceptrons (word-based) model on the labeled data Dl , respectively. Then, the parameters of both models are continually updated using unlabeled examples in a learning cycle. At each iteration, the raw sentences in Du are segmented by current character-based model θc and word-based model θw. Meanwhile, all the segmentation agreements A are collected (§ 3.1). Afterwards, the agreements A are used as a set of constraints to bias the learning of CRFs (§ 3.2) and Perceptron (§ 3.3) on the unlabeled data. The convergence criterion is the occurrence of a reduction of segmentation agreements or reaching the maximum number of learning iterations. In the final segmentation phase, given a raw sentence, the decoding requires both induced models (§ 3.4) in measuring a segmentation score. Algorithm 1 Co-regularized CWS model induction Require: n labeled sentences Dl; m unlabeled sentences Du Ensure: θc and θw 1: θ0","c ← crf train(Dl) 2: θ0","w ← perceptron train(Dl) 3: for t = 1...Tmax do 4: At","← agree(Du, θt−1","c , θt−1","w )","5: θt","c ← crf train constraints(Du, At",", θt−1","c )","6: θt","w ← perceptron train constraints(Du, At",", θt−1","w ) 7: end for 3.1 Agreements Between Two Models Given a raw sentence, e.g., “ 我 正 在 北 京 看 奥 运 会开幕式。(I am watching the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Beijing.)”, the two segmentations shown in Figure 1 are the predictions from a character-based and word-based model. The segmentation agreements between the two models correspond to the identical words. In this example, the five words, i.e. “我 (I)”, “ 北京 (Beijing)”, “ 看 (watch)”, “ 开幕式 (opening ceremony)” and “ 。(.)”, are the agreements. 3.2 CRFs with Constraints For the character-based model, this paper follows (Täckström et al., 2013) to incorporate the segmentation agreements into CRFs. The main idea is to constrain the size of the tag sequence lattice according to the agreements for achieving simplified learning. Figure 2 demonstrates an example of the constrained lattice, where the bold node represents that a definitive tag derived from the agreements is assigned to the current character, e.g., “ 我 (I)” has only one possible tag “S” because both models segmented it to a word with a single character. Here, if the lattice of all admissible tag sequences for the sentence x is denoted as Y(x), the constrained lattice can be defined by Ŷ(x, ỹ), where ỹ refers to tags inferred from the agreements. Thus, the objective function on unlabeled data is modeled as: θ̂′ c = argmax","θc m ∑ i=1","log pθc( Ŷ(xi , ỹi )|xi",") − γ∥θ","c∥2 2","(4)","It is a marginal conditional probability given by the total probability of all tag sequences consistent with the constrained lattice Ŷ(x, ỹ). This objective can be optimized by using LBFGS-B (Zhu et al., 1997), a generic quasi-Newton gradient-based optimizer. Figure 1: The segmentations given by character-based and word-based model, where the words in “ ” refer to the segmentation agreements. Figure 2: The constrained lattice representation for a given sentence, “ 我 正 在 北 京 看 奥 运 会 开 幕 式。”. 3.3 Perceptrons with Constraints For the word-based model, this study incorporates segmentation agreements by a modified parameter update criterion in Perceptrons online training, as shown in Algorithm 2. Because there are no “gold segmentations” for unlabeled sentences, the output sentence predicted by the current model is compared with the agreements instead of the “an-swers” in the supervised case. At each parameter 173 update iteration k, each raw sentence xu is decod-ed with the current model into a segmentation zu. If the words in output zu do not match the agreements A(xu) of the current sentence xu, the parameters are updated by adding the global feature vector of the current training example with the agreements and subtracting the global feature vector of the decoder output, as described in lines 3 and 4 of Algorithm 2.

An intuitive idea is that both induced models are combined to conduct the segmentation, for the sake of integrating their strengths. This paper employs a log-linear interpolation combination (Bishop, 2006) to formulate a joint scoring function based on character-based and word-based models in the decoding:","Score(w) = α · log(pθc(y|x)) +(1 − α) · log(φ(x, w) · θw) (5) where the two terms of the logarithm are the scores of character-based and word-based models, respectively, for a given segmentation w. This composite function uses a parameter α to weight the contributions of the two models. The α value is tuned using the development data."]},{"title":"4 Experiment 4.1 Setting","paragraphs":["The experimental data is taken from the Chinese tree bank (CTB). In order to make a fair comparison with the state-of-the-art results, the versions of CTB-5, CTB-6, and CTB-7 are used for the evaluation. The training, development and testing sets are defined according to the previous works. For CTB-5, the data split from (Jiang et al., 2008) is employed. For CTB-6, the same data split as recommended in the CTB-6 official document is used. For CTB-7, the datasets are formed according to the way in (Wang et al., 2011). The corresponding statistic information on these data s-plits is reported in Table 1. The unlabeled data in our experiments is from the XIN CMN portion of Chinese Gigaword 2.0. The articles published in 1991-1993 and 1999-2004 are used as unlabeled data, with 204 million words.","The feature templates in (Zhao et al., 2006) and (Zhang and Clark, 2007) are used in train-ing the CRFs model and Perceptrons model, respectively.

We evaluated the performance (F-score) of our model on the three development sets by using different α values, where α is progressively increased in steps of 0.1 (0 < α < 1.0). The best performed settings of α for CTB-5, CTB-6 and CTB-7 on development data are 0.7, 0.6 and 0.6, respectively. With the chosen parameters, the test data is used to measure the final performance.","Table 2 shows the F-score results of word segmentation on CTB-5, CTB-6 and CTB-7 testing sets. The line of “ours” reports the performance of our semi-supervised model with the tuned parameters. We first compare it with the supervised “baseline” method which joints character-based and word-based model trained only on the training set1",". It can be observed that our semi-supervised model is able to benefit from unlabeled data and greatly improves the results over the supervised baseline. We also compare our model with two state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods of Wang ’11 (Wang et al., 2011) and Sun ’11 (Sun and Xu, 2011). The performance scores of Wang ’11 are directly taken from their paper, while the results of Sun ’11 are obtained, using the program provided by the author, on the same experimental data. The","1","The “baseline” uses a different training configuration so that the α values in the decoding are also need to be tuned on the development sets. The tuned α values are {0.6, 0.6, 0.5} for CTB-5, CTB-6 and CTB-7. 174 bold scores indicate that our model does achieve significant gains over these two semi-supervised models. This outcome can further reveal that using the agreements from these two views to regularize the learning can effectively guide the model toward a better solution. The third comparison candidate is Hatori ’12 (Hatori et al., 2012) which reported the best performance in the literature on these three testing sets. It is a supervised joint model of word segmentation, POS tagging and dependency parsing. Impressively, our model still outperforms Hatori ’12 on all three datasets. Although there is only a 0.01 increase on CTB-5, it can be seen as a significant improvement when considering Hatori ’12 employs much richer training resources, i.e., sentences tagged with syntactic information.
