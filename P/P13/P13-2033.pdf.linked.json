The problem is pronounced in languages such as Japanese and Chinese, where words are not separated by whitespaces. In particular, compound nouns pose difficulties to WS since they are productive, and often consist of unknown words.","In Japanese, transliterated foreign compound words written in Katakana are extremely difficult to split up into components without proper lexical knowledge. For example, when splitting a compound noun ブ ラキッシュレッド burakisshureddo, a traditional word segmenter can easily segment this as ブ ラキッ/シュレッド “*blacki shred” since シュレッ ド shureddo “shred” is a known, frequent word. It is only the knowledge that ブラキッburaki (*“blacki”) is not a valid word which prevents this. Knowing that the back-transliterated unigram “blacki” and bigram “blacki shred” are unlikely in English can promote the correct WS, ブラキッシュ/レッド “blackish red”. In Chinese, the problem can be more severe since the language does not have a separate script to represent transliterated words.","Kaji and Kitsuregawa (2011) tackled Katakana compound splitting using back-transliteration and paraphrasing. Their approach falls into an offline approach, which focuses on creating dictionaries by extract-ing new words from large corpora separately before WS. However, offline approaches have limitation unless the lexicon is constantly updated. Moreover, they only deal with Katakana, but their method is not directly applicable to Chinese since the language lacks a separate script for transliterated words.","Instead, we adopt an online approach, which deals with unknown words simultaneously as the model analyzes the input. Our approach is based on semi-Markov discriminative structure prediction, and it incorporates English back-transliteration and English language models (LMs) into WS in a seamless way. We refer to this process of transliterating unknown words into another language and using the target LM as LM projection. Since the model employs a general transliteration model and a general English LM, it achieves robust WS for unknown words. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to use transliteration and projected LMs in an online, seamlessly integrated fashion for WS.","To show the effectiveness of our approach, we test our models on a Japanese balanced corpus and an electronic commerce domain corpus, and a balanced Chinese corpus. The results show that we achieved a significant improvement in WS accuracy in both languages."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["In Japanese WS, unknown words are usually dealt with in an online manner with the unknown word model, which uses heuristics 183 depending on character types (Kudo et al., 2004). Nagata (1999) proposed a Japanese unknown word model which considers PoS (part of speech), word length model and orthography. Uchimoto et al. (2001) proposed a maximum entropy morphological analyzer robust to unknown words. In Chinese, Peng et al. (2004) used CRF confidence to detect new words.","For offline approaches, Mori and Nagao (1996) extracted unknown word and estimated their PoS from a corpus through distributional analysis. Asahara and Matsumoto (2004) built a character-based chunking model using SVM for Japanese unknown word detection.","Kaji and Kitsuregawa (2011)’s approach is the closest to ours. They built a model to split Katakana compounds using back-transliteration and paraphrasing mined from large corpora. Nakazawa et al. (2005) is a similar approach, using a Ja-En dictionary to translate compound components and check their occurrence in an English corpus. Similar approaches are proposed for other languages, such as German (Koehn and Knight, 2003) and Urdu-Hindi (Lehal, 2010). Correct splitting of compound nouns has a positive effect on MT (Koehn and Knight, 2003) and IR (Braschler and Ripplinger, 2004).","A similar problem can be seen in Korean, German etc. where compounds may not be explicitly split by whitespaces. Koehn and Knight (2003) tackled the splitting problem in German, by using word statistics in a monolingual corpus. They also used the informa-tion whether translations of compound parts appear in a German-English bilingual corpus. Lehal (2010) used Urdu-Devnagri transliteration and a Hindi corpus for handling the space omission problem in Urdu compound words."]},{"title":"3 Word Segmentation Model","paragraphs":["Out baseline model is a semi-Markov structure prediction model which estimates WS and the PoS sequence simultaneously (Kudo et al., 2004; Zhang and Clark, 2008).

To incorporate this intuition, we used log probability of n-gram as features, which are included in Table 1 (ID 19 and 20): φLMS","1 (wi) = log p(wi) and φLMS 2 (wi−1, wi) = log p(wi−1, wi). Here the empirical probability p(wi) and p(wi−1, wi) are computed from the source language corpus. In Japanese, we applied this source language augmentation only to Katakana words. In Chinese, we did not limit the target. 4.1 Language Model Projection","As we mentioned in Section 2, English LM knowledge helps split transliterated compounds. We use (LM) projection, which is a combination of back-transliteration and an English model, by extending the normal lattice building process as follows:","Firstly, when the lattice is being built, each node is back-transliterated and the resulting nodes are associated with it, as shown in Figure 1 as the shaded nodes. Then, edges are spanned between these extended English nodes, instead of between the original nodes, by additionally taking into consideration English LM features (ID 21 and 22 in Table 1): φLMP 1 (wi) = log p(wi) and φLMP","2 (wi−1, wi) = log p(wi−1, wi). Here the empirical probability p(wi) and p(wi−1, wi) are computed from the English corpus. For example, Feature 21 is set to φLMP","1 (“blackish”) for node (a), to φLMP 1 (“red”) for node (b), and Feature 22 is set to φLMP","2 (“blackish”, “red”) for edge (c) in Figure 1. If no transliterations were generated, or the n-grams do not appear in the English corpus, a small frequency ε is assumed.","Finally, the created edges are traversed from EOS, and associated original nodes are chosen as the WS result. In Figure 1, the bold edges are traversed at the final step, and the corresponding nodes “大 - 人気 - 色 - ブラキッシュ- レッド” are chosen as the final WS result.","For Japanese, we only expand and project Katakana noun nodes (whether they are known or unknown words) since transliterated words are almost always written in Katakana. For Chinese, only “ns (place name)”, “nr (per-sonal name)”, and “nz (other proper noun)” nodes whose surface form is more than 1-character long are transliterated. As the English LM, we used Google Web 1T 5-gram Version 1 (Brants and Franz, 2006), limiting it to unigrams occurring more than 2000 times and bigrams occurring more than 500 times."]},{"title":"5 Transliteration","paragraphs":["For transliterating Japanese/Chinese words back to English, we adopted the Joint Source Channel (JSC) Model (Li et al., 2004), a generative model widely used as a simple yet powerful baseline in previous research e.g., (Hagiwara and Sekine, 2012; Finch and Sumita, 2010).2","The JSC model, given an input of source word s and target word t, defines the transliteration probability based on transliteration units (TUs) ui = ⟨si, ti⟩ as: PJSC (⟨s, t⟩) =","∏f","i=1 P (ui|ui−n+1, ..., ui−1), where f is the number of TUs in a given source / target word pair. TUs are atomic pair units of source / target words, such as “la/ラ” and “ish/ッシュ”. The TU n-gram probabilities are learned from a training corpus by following it-erative updates similar to the EM algorithm3",". In order to generate transliteration candidates, we used a stack decoder described in (Hagiwara and Sekine, 2012). We used the training data of the NEWS 2009 workshop (Li et al., 2009a; Li et al., 2009b).","As reference, we measured the performance on its own, using NEWS 2009 (Li et al., 2009b) data.

Although the numbers seem low at a first glance, Chinese back-transliteration itself is a very hard task, mostly because Chinese phonology is so different from English that some sounds may be dropped when transliterated. Therefore, we can regard this performance as a lower bound of the transliteration module performance we used for WS."]},{"title":"6 Experiments 6.1 Experimental Settings Corpora","paragraphs":["For Japanese, we used (1) EC corpus, consists of 1,230 product titles and descriptions randomly sampled from Rakuten (Rakuten-Inc., 2012). The corpus is manually annotated with the BCCWJ style WS (Ogura et al., 2011). It consists of 118,355 tokens, and has a relatively high percentage of Katakana words (11.2%). (2) BCCWJ (Maekawa, 2008) CORE (60,374 sentences, 1,286,899 tokens, out of which approx. 3.58% are Katakana words). As the dictionary, we used UniDic (Den et al., 2007). For Chinese, we used LCMC (McEnery and Xiao, 2004) (45,697 sentences and 1,001,549 tokens). As the dictionary, we used CC-CEDICT (MDGB, 2011)4",".","Training and Evaluation We used Averaged Perceptron (Collins, 2002) (3 iterations) for training, with five-fold cross-validation. As for the evaluation metrics, we used Precision (Prec.), Recall (Rec.), and F-measure (F). We additionally evaluated the performance limited to Katakana (JA) or proper nouns (ZH) in order to see the impact of compound splitting. We also used word error rate (WER) to see the relative change of errors. 6.2 Japanese WS Results","We compared the baseline model, the augmented model with the source language (+LM-S) and the projected model (+LM-P).

All the other words which do not appear in the training corpus are discarded. and KyTea 0.4.2 (Neubig et al., 2011) 5",". We observed slight improvement by incorporating the source LM, and observed a 0.48 point F-value increase over baseline, which translates to 4.65 point Katakana F-value change and 16.0% (3.56% to 2.99 %) WER reduction, mainly due to its higher Katakana word rate (11.2%). Here, MeCab+UniDic achieved slightly better Katakana WS than the proposed models. This may be because it is trained on a much larger training corpus (the whole BCCWJ). The same trend is observed for BCCWJ corpus (Table 2), where we gained statistically significant 1 point F-measure increase on Katakana word.","Many of the improvements of +LM-S over Baseline come from finer grained splitting, for example, * レインスーツ reinsuutsu “rain suits” to レイン/スーツ, while there is wrong over-splitting, e.g., テレキャスターterekyasutaa “Telecaster” to * テレ/キャスター. This type of error is reduced by +LM-P, e.g., * プラス/チッ ク purasu chikku “*plus tick” to プラスチック purasuchikku “plastic” due to LM projection. +LM-P also improved compounds whose components do not appear in the training data, such as * ルーカスフィルム ruukasufirumu to ルーカス/フィルム “Lucus Film.” Indeed, we randomly extracted 30 Katakana differences between +LM-S and +LM-P, and found out that 25 out of 30 (83%) are true improvement. One of the proposed method’s advantages is that it is very robust to variations, such as アクティベイティ ッド akutibeitiddo “activated,” even though only the original form, アクティベ イト akutibeito “activate” is in the dictionary.","One type of errors can be attributed to non-English words such as ス ノ コ ベッド sunokobeddo, which is a compound of Japanese word スノコ sunoko “duckboard” and an English word ベッド beddo “bed.” 6.3 Chinese WS Results","We compare the results on Chinese WS, with Stanford Segmenter (Tseng et al., 2005) (Table 4) 6",".

We found positive changes such as * 欧 麦/尔 萨 利 赫 oumai/ersalihe to 欧 麦 尔/萨 利 赫 oumaier/salihe “Umar Saleh” and * 领导/人 曼德拉 lingdao/renmandela to 领导人/曼德拉 lingdaoren/mandela“Leader Mandela”. However, considering the overall F-measure increase and proper noun F-measure decrease suggests that the effect of LM projection is not limited to proper nouns but also promoted finer granularity because we observed proper noun recall increase.","One of the reasons which make Chinese LM projection difficult is the corpus allows single tokens with a transliterated part and Chinese affices, e.g., 马克思主义者 makesizhuyizhe “Marxists” (马克思 makesi “Marx” + 主 义者 zhuyizhe “-ist (believers)”) and 尼罗河 niluohe “Nile River” ( 尼 罗 niluo “Nile” + 河 he “-river”). Another source of errors is transliteration accuracy. For example, no apours, and (2) our model only uses the intersection of the training set and the dictionary. Proper noun performance for the Stanford segmenter is not shown since it does not assign PoS tags. propriate transliterations were generated for 维娜斯 weinasi “Venus,” which is commonly spelled 维纳斯 weinasi. Improving the JSC model could improve the LM projection performance."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion and Future Works","paragraphs":["In this paper, we proposed a novel, online WS model for the Japanese/Chinese compound word splitting problem, by seamlessly incorporating the knowledge that back-transliteration of properly segmented words also appear in an English LM. The experimental results show that the model achieves a significant improvement over the baseline and LM augmentation, achieving 16% WER reduction in the EC domain.","The concept of LM projection is general enough to be used for splitting other compound nouns. For example, for Japanese per-sonal names such as 仲里依紗 Naka Riisa, if we could successfully estimate the pronuncia-tion Nakariisa and look up possible splits in an English LM, one is expected to find a correct WS Naka Riisa because the first and/or the last name are mentioned in the LM. Seek-ing broader application of LM projection is a future work. 187"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Masayuki Asahara and Yuji Matsumoto. 2004.
