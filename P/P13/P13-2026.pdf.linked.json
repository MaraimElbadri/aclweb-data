This motivates the development of a more accurate automated method to compute pyramid scores. Of three methods tested here, the one that performs best relies on latent semantics."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The pyramid method is an annotation and scoring procedure to assess semantic content of summaries in which the content units emerge from the annotation. Each content unit is weighted by its frequency in human reference summaries. It has been shown to produce reliable rankings of automated summarization systems, based on performance across multiple summarization tasks (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004; Passonneau, 2010). It has also been applied to assessment of oral narrative skills of children (Passonneau et al., 2007). Here we show its potential for assessment of the reading comprehension of community college students. We then present a method to automate pyramid scores based on latent semantics.","The pyramid method depends on two phases of manual annotation, one to identify weighted content units in model summaries written by proficient humans, and one to score target summaries against the models. The first annotation phase yields Summary Content Units (SCUs), sets of text fragments that express the same basic content. Each SCU is weighted by the number of model summaries it occurs in.","Figure 1 illustrates a Summary Content Unit taken from pyramid annotation of five model summaries of an elementary physics text. The elements of an SCU are its index; a label, created by the annotator; contributors (Ctr.), or text fragments from the model summaries; and the weight (Wt.), corresponding to the number of contributors from distinct model summaries. Four of the five model Index 105 Label Matter is what makes up all objects or substances Ctr. 1 Matter is what makes up all objects or substances Ctr. 2 matter as the stuff that all objects and substances","in the universe are made of Ctr. 3 Matter is identified as being present everywhere","and in all substances Ctr. 4 Matter is all the objects and substances around us Wt. 4 Figure 1: A Summary Content Unit (SCU) summaries contribute to SCU 105 shown here. The four contributors have lexical items in common (matter, objects, substances), and many differences (makes up, being present). SCU weights, which range from 1 to the number of model summaries M , induce a partition on the set of SCUs in all summaries into subsets Tw, w ∈ 1, . . . , M . The resulting partition is referred to as a pyramid because, starting with the subset for SCUs with weight 1, each next subset has fewer SCUs.","To score new target summaries, they are first annotated to identify which SCUs they express. Application of the pyramid method to assessment of student reading comprehension is impractical without an automated method to annotate target summaries. Previous work on automated pyramid scores of automated summarizers performs well at ranking systems on many document sets, but is not precise enough to score human summaries of a single text. We test three automated pyramid scoring procedures, and find that one based on distributional semantics correlates best with manual pyramid scores, and has higher precision and recall for content units in students’ summaries than methods that depend on string matching."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["The most prominent NLP technique applied to reading comprehension is LSA (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), an early approach to latent semantic analysis claimed to correlate with reading comprehension (Foltz et al., 2000). More recently, LSA 143 has been incorporated with a suite of NLP metrics to assess students’ strategies for reading comprehension using think-aloud protocols (Boonthum-Denecke et al., 2011). The resulting tool, and similar assesment tools such as Coh-Metrix, assess aspects of readability of texts, such as coherence, but do not assess students’ comprehension through their writing (Graesser et al., 2004; Graesser et al., 2011). E-rater is an automated essay scorer for standardized tests such as GMAT that also relies on a suite of NLP techniques (Burstein et al., 1998; Burstein, 2003). The pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004), was inspired in part by work in reading comprehension that scores content using human annotation (Beck et al., 1991).","An alternate line of research attempts to replicate human reading comprehension. An automated tool to read and answer questions relies on abductive reasoning over logical forms extracted from text (Wellner et al., 2006). One of the performance issues is resolving meanings of words: removal of WordNet features degraded performance.","The most widely used automated content evaluation is ROUGE (Lin, 2004; Lin and Hovy, 2003). It relies on model summaries, and depends on ngram overlap measures of different types. Because of its dependence on strings, it performs better with larger sets of model summaries. In contrast to ROUGE, pyramid scoring is robust with as few as four or five model summaries (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004). A fully automated approach to evaluation for ranking systems that requires no model summaries incorporates latent semantic distributional similarities across words (Louis and Nenkova, 2009). The authors note, however, it does not perform well on individual summaries."]},{"title":"3 Criteria for Automated Scoring","paragraphs":["Pyramid scores of students’ summaries correlate well with a manual main ideas score developed for an intervention study with community college freshmen who attended remedial classes (Perin et al., In press). Twenty student summaries by students who attended the same college and took the same remedial course were selected from a larger set of 322 that summarized an elementary physics text. All were native speakers of English, and scored within 5 points of the mean reading score for the larger sample. For the intervention study, student summaries had been assigned a score to represent how many main ideas from the source text were covered (Perin et al., In press). Interrater reliability of the main ideas score, as given by the Pearson correlation coefficient, was 0.92.","One of the co-authors created a model pyramid from summaries written by proficient Masters of Education students, annotated 20 target summaries against this pyramid, and scored the result. The raw score of a target summary is the sum of its SCU weights. Pyramid scores have been normalized by the number of SCUs in the summary (analogous to precision), or the average number of SCUs in model summaries (analogous to recall). We normalized raw scores as the average of the two previous normalizations (analogous to F-measure). The resulting scores have a high Pearson’s correlation of 0.85 with the main idea score (Perin et al., In press) that was manually assigned to the students’ summaries.","To be pedagogically useful, an automated method to assign pyramid scores to students’ summaries should meet the following criteria: 1) reliably rank students’ summaries of a source text, 2) assign correct pyramid scores, and 3) identify the correct SCUs. A method could do well on criterion 1 but not 2, through scores that have uniform differences from corresponding manual pyramid scores. Also, since each weight partition will have more than one SCU, it is possible to produce the correct numeric score by matching incorrect SCUs that have the correct weights. Our method meets the first two criteria, and has superior performance on the third to other methods."]},{"title":"4 Approach: Dynamic Programming","paragraphs":["Previous work observed that assignment of SCUs to a target summary can be cast as a dynamic programming problem (Harnly et al., 2005). The method presented there relied on unigram overlap to score the closeness of the match of each eligible substring in a summary against each SCU in the pyramid. It returned the set of matches that yielded the highest score for the summary. It produced good rankings across summarization tasks, but assigned scores much lower than those assigned by humans. Here we extend the DP approach in two ways. We test two new semantic text similarities, a string comparison method and a distributional semantic method, and we present a general mechanism to set a threshold value for an arbitrary computation of text similarity.","Unigram overlap ignores word order, and can-not consider the latent semantic content of a string, only the observed unigram tokens. To 144 take order into account, we use Ratcliff/Obershelp (R/O), which measures overlap of common subsequences (Ratcliff and Metzener, 1988). To take the underlying semantics into account, we use cosine similarity of 100-dimensional latent vectors of the candidate substrings and of the textual components of the SCU (label and contributors). Because the algorithm optimizes for the total sum of all SCUs, when there is no threshold similarity to count as a match, it favors matching shorter substrings to SCUs with higher weights. Therefore, we add a threshold to the algorithm, below which matches are not considered. Because each similarity metric has different properties and distributions, a single absolute value threshhold is not comparable across metrics. We present a method to set comparable thresholds across metrics. 4.1 Latent Vector Representations To represent the semantics of SCUs and candidate substrings of target summaries, we applied the latent vector model of Guo and Diab (2012).1","Guo and Diab find that it is very hard to learn a 100-dimension latent vector based only on the limited observed words in a short text. Hence they include unobserved words that provide thousands more features for a short text. This produces more accurate results for short texts, which makes the method suitable for our problem. Weighted matrix factorization (WMF) assigns a small weight for missing words so that latent semantics depends largely on observed words.","A 100-dimension latent vector representation was learned for every span of contiguous words within sentence bounds in a target summary, for the 20 summaries. The training data was selected to be domain independent, so that our model could be used for summaries across domains. Thus we prepared a corpus that is balanced across topics and genres. It is drawn from from WordNet sense definitions, Wiktionary sense definitions, and the Brown corpus. It yields a co-occurrence matrix M of unique words by sentences of size 46,619 × 393,666. Mij holds the TF-IDF value of word wi in sentence sj. Similarly, the contributors to and the label for an SCU were given a 100-dimensional latent vector representation. These representations were then used to compare candidates from a summary to SCUs in the pyramid. 1 http://www.cs.columbia.edu/ w̃eiwei/ code.html#wtmf. 4.2 Three Comparison Methods An SCU consists of at least two text strings: the SCU label and one contributor. As in Harnly et al. (2005), we use three similarity comparisons scusim(X, SCU ), where X is the target summary string. When the comparison parameter is set to min (max, or mean), the similarity of X to each SCU contributor and the label is computed in turn, and the minimum (max, or mean) is returned. 4.3 Similarity Thresholds We define a threshold parameter for a target SCU to match a pyramid SCU based on the distributions of scores each similarity method gives to the target SCUs identified by the human annotator. Annotation of the target summaries yielded 204 SCUs. The similarity score being a continuous random variable, the empirical sample of 204 scores is very sparse. Hence, we use a Gaussian kernel density estimator to provide a non-parametric estima-tion of the probability densities of scores assigned by each of the similarity methods to the manually identified SCUs. We then select five threshold values corresponding to those for which the inverse cumulative density function (icdf) is equal to 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25. Each threshold represents the probability that a manually identified SCU will be missed."]},{"title":"5 Experiment","paragraphs":["The three similarity computations, three methods to compare against SCUs, and five icdf thresholds yield 45 variants, as shown in Figure 2. Each variant was evaluated by comparing the unnormalized automated variant, e.g., Lvc, max, 0.64 (its 0.15 icdf) to the human gold scores, using each of the evaluation metrics described in the next subsection. To compute confidence intervals for the evaluation metrics for each variant, we use bootstrapping with 1000 samples (Efron and Tibshirani, 1986).","To assess the 45 variants, we compared their scores to the manual scores. We also compared the sets of SCUs retrieved. By our criterion 1), an automated score that correlates well with manual scores for summaries of a given text could be used (3 Similarities) × (3 Comparisons) × (5 Thresholds) = 45 (Uni, R/O, Lvc) × (min, mean, max) × (0.05, . . . , 0.25) Figure 2: Notation used for the 45 variants 145","Variant (with icdf) P (95% conf.), rank S (95% conf.), rank K (95% conf.), rank μ Diff.

We report several types of correlation tests. Pearsons tests the strength of a linear correlation between the two sets of scores; it will be high if the same order is produced, with the same distance between pairs of scores. The Spearman rank correlation is said to be preferable for ordinal comparisons, meaning where the unit interval is less relevant. Kendall’s tau, an alternative rank correlation, is less sensitive to outliers and more intuitive. It is the proportion of concordant pairs (pairs in the same order) less the proportion of discordant pairs. Since correlations can be high when differences are uniform, we use Student’s T to test whether differences score means statistically significant. Criterion 2) is met if the correlations are high and the means are not significantly different."]},{"title":"6 Results","paragraphs":["The correlation tests indicate that several variants achieve sufficiently high correlations to rank students’ summaries (criterion 2). On all correlation tests, the highest ranking automated method is LVc, max, 0.64; this similarity threshold corresponds to the 0.15 icdf. As shown in Table 1, the Pearson correlation is 0.93. Note, however, that it is not significantly higher than many of its competitors. LVc, min, 0.40 did not rank as highly for Speaman and Kendall’s tau correlations, but the Student’s T result in column 3 of Table 1 shows that this is the only variant in the table that yields absolute scores that are not significantly different from the human annotated scores. Thus this variant best balances criteria 1 and 2.","The differences in the unnormalized score computed by the automated systems from the score assigned by human annotation are consistently positive. Inspection of the SCUs retrieved by each automated variant reveals that the automated systems lean toward the tendency to identify false positives. This may result from the DP implementation decision to maximize the score. To get a measure of the degree of overlap between the SCUs that were selected automatically versus manually (criterion 4), we computed recall and precision for the various methods. Table 2 shows the mean recall and precision (with standard deviations) across all five thresholds for each combination of similarity method and method of comparison to the SCU. The low standard deviations show that the recall and precision are relatively similar across thresholds for each variant. The LVc methods outperform R/O and unigram overlap methods, particularly for the precision of SCUs retrieved, indicat-ing the use of distributional semantics is a superior approach for pyramid summary scoring than methods based on string matching.","The unigram overlap and R/O methods show the least variation across comparison methods (min, mean, max). LVc methods outperform them, on precision (Table 2). Meeting all three criteria is difficult, and the LVc method is clearly superior."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We extended a dynamic programming frame-work (Harnly et al., 2005) to automate pyramid scores more accurately. Improvements resulted from principled thresholds for similarity, and from a vector representation (LVc) to capture the latent semantics of short spans of text (Guo and Diab, 2012). The LVc methods perform best at all three criteria for a pedagogically useful automatic metric. Future work will address how to improve precision and recall of the gold SCUs."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We thank the reviewers for very valuable insights.
