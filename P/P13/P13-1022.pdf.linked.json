Börschinger et al. (2011) introduced an approach that reduces grounded language learning to unsupervised probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) induction and demonstrated its effectiveness on the task of sportscasting simulated robot soccer games. Subsequently, Kim and Mooney (2012) extended their approach to make it tractable for the more complex problem of learning to follow natural-language navigation instructions from observations of humans following such instructions in a virtual environment (Chen and Mooney, 2011). The observed sequence of actions provides very weak, ambiguous supervision for learning instructional language since there are many possible ways to describe the same execution path. Although their approach improved accuracy on the navigation task compared to the original work of Chen and Mooney (2011), it was still far from human performance.","Since their system employs a generative model, discriminative reranking (Collins, 2000) could potentially improve its performance. By training a discriminative classifier that uses global features of complete parses to identify correct interpretations, a reranker can significantly improve the accuracy of a generative model. Reranking has been successfully employed to improve syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002b), semantic parsing (Lu et al., 2008; Ge and Mooney, 2006), semantic role labeling (Toutanova et al., 2005), and named entity recognition (Collins, 2002c). Standard reranking requires gold-standard interpretations (e.g. parse trees) to train the discriminative classifier. However, grounded language learning does not provide gold-standard interpretations for the training examples. Only the ambiguous perceptual context of the utterance is provided as supervision. For the navigation task, this supervision consists of the observed sequence of actions taken by a human when following an instruction. Therefore, it is impossible to directly apply conventional discriminative reranking to such problems. We show how to adapt reranking to work with such weak supervision. Instead of using gold-standard an-notations to determine the correct interpretations, we simply prefer interpretations of navigation instructions that, when executed in the world, actually reach the intended destination. Additionally, we extensively revise the features typically used in parse reranking to work with the PCFG approach to grounded language learning.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the navigation task and the PCFG approach to grounded language learning. Section 3 presents our modified approach to reranking and Section 4 describes the novel features used to evaluate parses. Section 5 experimentally evaluates the approach comparing to sev-218 (a) Sample virtual world of hallways with varying tiles, wallpapers, and landmark objects indicated by letters (e.g. “H” for hat-rack) and illustrating a sample path taken by a human follower.

The goal is to interpret natural-language (NL) instructions in a virtual environment, thereby allowing a simulated robot to navigate to a specified location. Figure 1a shows a sample path executed by a human following the instruction in Figure 1b. Given no prior linguistic knowledge, the task is to learn to interpret such instructions by simply observing humans follow sample directions. Formally speaking, given training examples of the form (ei, ai, wi), where ei is an NL instruction, ai is an executed action sequence for the instruction, and wi is the initial world state, we want to learn to produce an appropriate action sequence aj given a novel (ej, wj).","More specifically, one must learn a semantic parser that produces a plan pj using a formal meaning representation (MR) language introduced by Chen and Mooney (2011). This plan is then executed by a simulated robot in a virtual environment. The MARCO system, introduced by MacMahon et al. (2006), executes the formal plan, flexibly adapting to situations encountered during execution and producing the action sequence aj. During learning, Chen and Mooney construct a landmarks plan ci for each training example, which includes the complete context observed in the world-state resulting from each observed action. The correct plan, pi, (which is latent and must be inferred) is assumed to be composed from a subset of the components in the corresponding landmarks plan. The landmarks and correct plans for a sample instruction are shown in Figure 1b.","2.2 PCFG Induction for Grounded Language Learning The baseline generative model we use for reranking employs the unsupervised PCFG induction approach introduced by Kim and Mooney (2012). This model is, in turn, based on the earlier model of Börschinger et al. (2011), which transforms the grounded language learning into unsupervised PCFG induction. The general approach uses grammar-formulation rules which construct CFG productions that form a grammar that effectively maps NL sentences to formal meaning representations (MRs) encoded in its nonterminals. After using Expectation-Maximization (EM) to estimate the parameters for these productions using the ambiguous supervision provided by the grounded-learning setting, it produces a PCFG whose most probable parse for a sentence encodes its correct semantic interpretation. Unfortunately, the initial approach of Börschinger et al. (2011) produces explosively large grammars when applied to more complex problems, such as our navigation task. Therefore, Kim and Mooney enhanced their approach to use a previously learned semantic lexicon to reduce the induced grammar to a tractable size. They also altered the processes for constructing productions and mapping parse trees to MRs in order to make the construction of semantic interpretations more compositional and allow the efficient construction of more complex representa-219 Figure 2: Simplified parse for the sentence “Turn left and find the sofa then turn around the corner” for Kim and Mooney’s model.

Our proposed reranking model is used to discriminatively reorder the top parses produced by this generative model. A simplified version of a sample parse tree for Kim and Mooney’s model is shown in Figure 2."]},{"title":"3 Modified Reranking Algorithm","paragraphs":["In reranking, a baseline generative model is first trained and generates a set of candidate outputs for each training example. Next, a second con-ditional model is trained which uses global features to rescore the candidates. Reranking using an averaged perceptron (Collins, 2002a) has been successfully applied to a variety of NLP tasks. Therefore, we modify it to rerank the parse trees generated by Kim and Mooney (2012)’s model. The approach requires three subcomponents: 1) a GEN function that returns the list of top n candidate parse trees for each NL sentence produced by the generative model, 2) a feature function Φ that maps a NL sentence, e, and a parse tree, y, into a real-valued feature vector Φ(e, y) ∈ Rd",", and 3) a reference parse tree that is compared to the highest-scoring parse tree during training.","However, grounded language learning tasks, such as our navigation task, do not provide reference parse trees for training examples. Instead, our modified model replaces the gold-standard reference parse with the “pseudo-gold” parse tree","Algorithm 1 AVERAGED PERCEPTRON TRAIN-","ING WITH RESPONSE-BASED UPDATE","Input: A set of training examples (ei, y∗","i ),","where ei is a NL sentence and y∗ i =","arg maxy∈GEN(ei) EXEC(y)","Output: The parameter vector W̄ , averaged","over all iterations 1...T 1: procedure PERCEPTRON 2: Initialize W̄ = 0 3: for t = 1...T, i = 1...n do 4: yi = arg maxy∈GEN(ei) Φ(ei, y) · W̄ 5: if yi ̸= y∗","i then 6: W̄ = W̄ + Φ(ei, y∗","i ) − Φ(ei, yi) 7: end if 8: end for 9: end procedure whose derived MR plan is most successful at getting to the desired goal location. Thus, the third component in our reranking model becomes an evaluation function EXEC that maps a parse tree y into a real number representing the success rate (w.r.t. successfully reaching the intended destina-tion) of the derived MR plan m composed from y.","Additionally, we improve the perceptron training algorithm by using multiple reference parses to update the weight vector W̄ . Although we determine the pseudo-gold reference tree to be the candidate parse y∗","such that y∗","= arg maxy∈GEN(e) EXEC(y), it may not actually be the correct parse for the sentence. Other parses may contain useful information for learning, and therefore we devise a way to update weights using all candidate parses whose successful execution rate is greater than the parse preferred by the currently learned model. 3.1 Response-Based Weight Updates To circumvent the need for gold-standard reference parses, we select a pseudo-gold parse from the candidates produced by the GEN function. In a similar vein, when reranking semantic parses, Ge and Mooney (2006) chose as a reference parse the one which was most similar to the gold-standard semantic annotation. However, in the navigation task, the ultimate goal is to generate a plan that, when actually executed in the virtual environment, leads to the desired destination. Therefore, the pseudo-gold reference is chosen as the candidate parse that produces the MR plan with the great-220 est execution success. This requires an external module that evaluates the execution accuracy of the candidate parses. For the navigation task, we use the MARCO (MacMahon et al., 2006) execution module, which is also used to evaluate how well the overall system learns to follow directions (Chen and Mooney, 2011). Since MARCO is nondeterministic when executing underspecified plans, we execute each candidate plan 10 times, and its execution rate is the percentage of trials in which it reaches the correct destination. When there are multiple candidate parses tied for the highest execution rate, the one assigned the largest probability by the baseline model is selected. Our modified averaged perceptron procedure with such a response-based update is shown in Algorithm 1.","One additional issue must be addressed when computing the output of the GEN function. The final plan MRs are produced from parse trees using compositional semantics (see Kim and Mooney (2012) for details). Consequently, the n-best parse trees for the baseline model do not necessarily produce the n-best distinct plans, since many parses can produce the same plan. Therefore, we adapt the GEN function to produce the n best distinct plans rather than the n best parses. This may require examining many more than the n best parses, because many parses have insignificant differences that do not affect the final plan. The score assigned to a plan is the probability of the most probable parse that generates that plan. In order to efficiently compute the n best plans, we modify the exact n-best parsing algorithm developed by Huang and Chiang (2005). The modified algorithm ensures that each plan in the computed n best list produces a new distinct plan. 3.2 Weight Updates Using Multiple Parses Typically, when used for reranking, the averaged perceptron updates its weights using the feature-vector difference between the current best predicted candidate and the gold-standard reference (line 6 in Algorithm 1). In our initial modified version, we replaced the gold-standard reference parse with the pseudo-gold reference, which has the highest execution rate amongst all candidate parses. However, this ignores all other candidate parses during perceptron training. However, it is not ideal to regard other candidate parses as “use-less.” There may be multiple candidate parses with the same maximum execution rate, and even candidates with lower execution rates could represent the correct plan for the instruction given the weak, indirect supervision provided by the observed sequence of human actions.","Therefore, we also consider a further modification of the averaged perceptron algorithm which updates its weights using multiple candidate parses. Instead of only updating the weights with the single difference between the predicted and pseudo-gold parses, the weight vector W̄ is updated with the sum of feature-vector differences between the current predicted candidate and all other candidates that have a higher execution rate. Formally, in this version, we replace lines 5–6 of Algorithm 1 with: 1: for all y ∈ GEN(ei) where y ̸= yi and EXEC(y) > EXEC(yi) do 2: W̄ = W̄ + (EXEC(y) − EXEC(yi))","×(Φ(ei, y) − Φ(ei, yi)) 3: end for where EXEC(y) is the execution rate of the MR plan m derived from parse tree y.","In the experiments below, we demonstrate that, by exploiting multiple reference parses, this new update rule increases the execution accuracy of the final system. Intuitively, this approach gathers additional information from all candidate parses with higher execution accuracy when learning the discriminative reranker. In addition, as shown in line 2 of the algorithm above, it uses the difference in execution rates between a candidate and the currently preferred parse to weight the update to the parameters for that candidate. This allows more effective plans to have a larger impact on the learned model in each iteration."]},{"title":"4 Reranking Features","paragraphs":["This section describes the features Φ extracted from parses produced by the generative model and used to rerank the candidates. 4.1 Base Features The base features adapt those used in previous reranking methods, specifically those of Collins (2002a), Lu et al.

Certainty assigned by the base generative model. 4.2 Predicate-Only Features The base features above generally include nonterminal symbols used in the parse tree. In the grounded PCFG model, nonterminals are named after components of the semantic representations (MRs), which are complex and numerous. There are ≃ 2,500 nonterminals in the grammar constructed for the navigation data, most of which are very specific and rare. This results in a very large, sparse feature space which can easily lead 222 the reranking model to over-fit the training data and prevent it from generalizing properly.","Therefore, we also tried constructing more general features that are less sparse. First, we construct generalized versions of the base features in which nonterminal symbols use only predicate names and omit their arguments. In the navigation task, action arguments frequently contain redundant, rarely used information. In particular, the interleaving verification steps frequently include many details that are never actually mentioned in the NL instructions. For instance, a nonterminal for the MR Turn(LEFT), Verify(at:SOFA,front:EASEL), Travel(steps:3) is transformed into the predicate-only form Turn(), Verify(), Travel() , and then used to construct more general versions of the base features described in the previous section. Second, another version of the base features are constructed in which nonterminal symbols include action arguments but omit all interleaving verification steps. This is a somewhat more conservative simplification of the nonterminal symbols. Although verification steps sometimes help interpret the actions and their surrounding context, they frequently cause the nonterminal symbols to become unnecessarily complex and specific. 4.3 Descended Action Features Finally, another feature group which we utilize captures whether a particular atomic action in a nonterminal “descends” into one of its child nonterminals or not. An atomic action consists of a predicate and its arguments, e.g. Turn(LEFT), Travel(steps:2), or Verify(at:SOFA). When an atomic action descends into lower nonterminals in a parse tree, it indicates that it is mentioned in the NL instruction and is therefore important. Below are several feature types related to descended actions that are used in our reranking model:","a) Descended Action. Indicates whether a given atomic action in a nonterminal descends to the next level. In Figure 3, f (Turn(LEFT)) = 1 since it descends into L2 and L4.","b) Descended Action Unigram.

(2006), and includes English instructions and human follower data.1","The data contains 706 route instructions for three virtual worlds. The instructions were produced by six instructors for 126 unique starting and ending location pairs over the three maps. Each instruction is annotated with 1 to 15 human follower traces with an average of 10.4 actions per instruction. Each instruction contains an average of 5.0 sentences each with an average of 7.8 words. Chen and Mooney (2011) constructed a version of the data in which each sentence is annotated with the actions taken by the majority of followers when responding to this sentence. This single-sentence version is used for training. Manually annotated “gold standard” formal plans for each sentence are used for evaluation purposes only.","We followed the same experimental methodology as Kim and Mooney (2012) and Chen and Mooney (2011). We performed “leave one environment out” cross-validation, i.e. 3 trials of training on two environments and testing on the third. The baseline model is first trained on data for two environments and then used to generate the n = 50 best plans for both training and testing instructions. As mentioned in Section 3.1, we need to generate many more top parse trees to get 50 distinct formal MR plans. We limit the number of best parse trees to 1,000,000, and even with this high limit, some training examples were left with less than 50 distinct plans.2","Each candidate 1","Data is available at http://www.cs.utexas. edu/users/ml/clamp/navigation/ 2","9.6% of the examples (310 out of total 3237) produced less than 50 distinct MR plans in the evaluation.

Our reranking model is then trained on the training data using the n-best candidate parses. We only retain reranking features that appear (i.e. have a value of 1) at least twice in the training data.","Finally, we measure both parse and execution accuracy on the test data. Parse accuracy evaluates how well a system maps novel NL sentences for new environments into correct MR plans (Chen and Mooney, 2011). It is calculated by comparing the system’s MR output to the gold-standard MR. Accuracy is measured using F1, the harmonic mean of precision and recall for individual MR constituents, thereby giving partial credit to approximately correct MRs. We then execute the resulting MR plans in the test environment to see whether they successfully reach the desired destinations. Execution is evaluated both for single sentence and complete paragraph instructions. Successful execution rates are calculated by averaging 10 nondeterministic MARCO executions. 5.2 Reranking Results Oracle results As typical in reranking experiments, we first present results for an “oracle” that always returns the best result amongst the top-n candidates produced by the baseline system, thereby providing an upper bound on the improvements possible with reranking. Table 1 shows oracle accuracy for both semantic parsing and plan execution for single sentence and complete paragraph instructions for various values of n. For oracle parse accuracy, for each sentence, we pick the parse that gives the highest F1 score. For oracle single-sentence execution accuracy, we pick the parse that gives the highest execution success rate. These single-sentence plans are then concatenated to produce a complete plan for each paragraph instruction in order to measure overall execution accuracy. Since making an error in any of the sentences in an instruction can easily lead to the wrong final destina-tion, paragraph-level accuracies are always much lower than sentence-level ones. In order to balance oracle accuracy and the computational effort required to produce n distinct plans, we chose n = 50 for the final experiments since oracle performance begins to asymptote at this point. Response-based vs. gold-standard reference weight updates Table 2 presents reranking results for our proposed response-based weight update (Single) for the averaged perceptron (cf. Section 3.1) compared to the typical weight update method using gold-standard parses (Gold). Since the gold-standard annotation gives the correct MR rather than a parse tree for each sentence, Gold selects as a single reference parse the candidate in the top 50 whose resulting MR is most similar to the gold-standard MR as determined by its parse accuracy. Ge and Mooney (2006) employ a similar approach when reranking semantic parses.","The results show that our response-based approach (Single) has better execution accuracy than both the baseline and the standard approach using gold-standard parses (Gold). However, Gold does perform best on parse accuracy since it explicitly focuses on maximizing the accuracy of the resulting MR. In contrast, by focusing discriminative training on optimizing performance of the ultimate end task, our response-based approach actually outperforms the traditional approach on the final task. In addition, it only utilizes feedback that is naturally available for the task, rather than requiring an expert to laboriously annotate each sentence with a gold-standard MR. Even though Gold captures more elements of the gold-standard MRs, it may miss some critical MR components that are crucial to the final navigation task. The overall result is very promising because it demonstrates how reranking can be applied to grounded language learning tasks where gold-standard parses are not readily available. 224","Parse Acc Plan Execution","F1 Single Para Baseline 74.81 57.22 20.17 Gold 78.26 52.57 19.33 Single 73.32 59.65 22.62 Multi 73.43 62.81 26.57 Table 2: Reranking results comparing our response-based methods using single (Single) or multiple (Multi) pseudo-gold parses to the standard approach using a single gold-standard parse (Gold).

Weight update with single vs. multiple reference parses Table 2 also shows performance when using multiple reference parse trees to update weights (cf. Section 3.2). Using multiple parses (Multi) clearly performs better for all evaluation metrics, particularly execution. As explained in Section 3.2, the single-best pseudo-gold parse provides weak, ambiguous feedback since it only provides a rough estimate of the response feedback from the execution module. Using a variety of preferable parses to update weights provides a greater amount and variety of weak feedback and therefore leads to a more accurate model.3 Comparison of different feature groups Table 3 compares reranking results using the different feature groups described in Section 4. Compared to the baseline model (Kim and Mooney, 2012), each of the feature groups Base (base features), Pred (predicate-only and verification-removed features), and Desc (descended action features) helps improve the performance of plan execution for both single sentence and complete paragraph navigation instructions. Among them, Desc is the most effective group of features.

This indicates that, unlike Multi, parses other than the best one do not have useful information in terms of optimizing normal parse accuracy. Instead, additional parses seem to add noise to the training process in this case. Therefore, updating with multiple parses does not appear to be useful in standard reranking.
