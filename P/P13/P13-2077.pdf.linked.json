In this paper, we propose a unified question retrieval model based on latent semantic indexing with tensor analysis, which can capture word associations among different parts of CQA triples simultaneously. Thus, our method can reduce lexical chasm of question retrieval with the help of the information of question content and answer parts. The experimental result shows that our method outperforms the traditional methods."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Community-based (or collaborative) question answering(CQA) such as Yahoo! An-swers1","and Baidu Zhidao2","has become a popular online service in recent years. Unlike traditional question answering (QA), information seekers can post their questions on a CQA website which are later answered by other users. However, with the increase of the CQA archive, there accumulate massive duplicate questions on CQA websites. One of the primary reasons is that information seekers cannot retrieve answers they need and thus post another new question consequently. Therefore, it becomes more and more important to find semantically similar questions.","The major challenge for CQA retrieval is the lexical gap (or lexical chasm) among the questions (Jeon et al., 2005b; Xue et al., 2008),","1","http://answers.yahoo.com/","2","http://zhidao.baidu.com/ Query: Q: Why is my laptop screen blinking? Expected: Q1: How to troubleshoot a flashing screen on an LCD monitor? Not Expected: Q2: How to blinking text on screen with PowerPoint? Table 1: An example on question retrieval as shown in Table 1. Since question-answer pairs are usually short, the word mismatching problem is especially important. However, due to the lexical gap between questions and answers as well as spam typically existing in user-generated content, filtering and ranking answers is very challenging.","The earlier studies mainly focus on generat-ing redundant features, or finding textual clues using machine learning techniques; none of them ever consider questions and their answers as relational data but instead model them as independent information. Moreover, they only consider the answers of the current question, and ignore any previous knowledge that would be helpful to bridge the lexical and se mantic gap.","In recent years, many methods have been proposed to solve the word mismatching problem between user questions and the questions in a QA archive(Blooma and Kurian, 2011), among which the translation-based (Riezler et al., 2007; Xue et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2011) or syntactic-based approaches (Wang et al., 2009) methods have been proven to improve the performance of CQA retrieval.","However, most of these approaches used 434 pipeline methods: (1) modeling word association; (2) question retrieval combined with other models, such as vector space model (VSM), Okapi model (Robertson et al., 1994) or language model (LM). The pipeline methods often have many non-trivial experimental setting and result to be very hard to reproduce.","In this paper, we propose a novel unified retrieval model for CQA, latent semantic tensor indexing (LSTI), which is an extension of the conventional latent semantic indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al., 1990). Similar to LSI, LSTI can integrate the two detached parts (modeling word association and question retrieval) into a single model.","In traditional document retrieval, LSI is an effective method to overcome two of the most severe constraints on Boolean keyword queries: synonymy, that is, multiple words with similar meanings, and polysemy, or words with more than one meanings.","Usually in a CQA archive, each entry (or question) is in the following triple form:⟨question title, question content, answer⟩. Because the performance based solely on the content or the answer part is less than satisfactory, many works proposed that additional relevant information should be provided to help question retrieval(Xue et al., 2008). For example, if a question title contains the keyword “why”, the CQA triple, which contains “because” or “reason” in its answer part, is more likely to be what the user looks for.","Since each triple in CQA has three parts, the natural representation of the CQA collection is a three-dimensional array, or 3rd-order tensor, rather than a matrix. Based on the tensor decomposition, we can model the word association simultaneously in the pairs: question-question, question-body and question-answer.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 3 introduces the concept of LSI. Section 4 presents our method. Section 5 de-scribes the experimental analysis. Section 6 concludes the paper."]},{"title":"2 Related Works","paragraphs":["There are some related works on question retrieval in CQA. Various query expansion techniques have been studied to solve word mismatch problems between queries and documents. The early works on question retrieval can be traced back to finding similar questions in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) archives, such as the FAQ finder (Burke et al., 1997), which usually used statistical and semantic similarity measures to rank FAQs.","Jeon et al. (2005a; 2005b) compared four different retrieval methods, i.e., the vector space model(Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005), the Okapi BM25 model (Robertson et al., 1994), the language model, and the translation model, for question retrieval on CQA data, and the experimental results showed that the translation model outperforms the others. However, they focused only on similarity measures between queries (questions) and question titles.","In subsequent work (Xue et al., 2008), a translation-based language model combining the translation model and the language model for question retrieval was proposed. The results showed that translation models help question retrieval since they could effectively address the word mismatch problem of questions. Additionally, they also explored answers in question retrieval.","Duan et al. (2008) proposed a solution that made use of question structures for retrieval by building a structure tree for questions in a category of Yahoo! Answers, which gave more weight to important phrases in question matching.","Wang et al. (2009) employed a parser to build syntactic trees for questions, and questions were ranked based on the similarity between their syntactic trees and that of the query question.","It is worth noting that our method is to-tally different to the work (Cai et al., 2006) of the same name. They regard documents as matrices, or the second order tensors to generate a low rank approximations of matrices (Ye, 2005). For example, they convert a 1, 000, 000-dimensional vector of word space into a 1000 × 1000 matrix. However in our model, a document is still represented by a vector. We just project a higher-dimensional vector to a lower-dimensional vector, but not a matrix in Cai’s model. A 3rd-order tensor is 435 also introduced in our model for better representation for CQA corpus."]},{"title":"3 Latent Semantic Indexing","paragraphs":["Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al., 1990), also called Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), is an approach to automatic indexing and information retrieval that attempts to overcome these problems by mapping documents as well as terms to a representation in the so-called latent semantic space.","The key idea of LSI is to map documents (and by symmetry terms) to a low dimensional vector space, the latent semantic space. This mapping is computed by decomposing the term-document matrix N with SVD, N = U ΣV t",", where U and V are orthogonal matrices U t","U = V t","V = I and the diagonal matrix Σ contains the singular values of N . The LSA approximation of N is computed by just keep the largest K singular values in Σ, which is rank K optimal in the sense of the L2","-norm.","LSI has proven to result in more robust word processing in many applications."]},{"title":"4 Tensor Analysis for CQA 4.1 Tensor Algebra","paragraphs":["We first introduce the notation and basic definitions of multilinear algebra. Scalars are denoted by lower case letters (a, b, . . . ), vectors by bold lower case letters (a, b, . . . ), matrices by bold upper-case letters (A, B, . . . ), and higher-order tensors by calligraphic upper-case letters (A, B, . . . ).","A tensor, also known as n-way array, is a higher order generalization of a vector (first order tensor) and a matrix (second order tensor). The order of tensor D ∈ RI1×I2×···×IN","is N . An element of D is denoted as di1,...,N .","An N th-order tensor can be flattened into a matrix by N ways. We denote the matrix D(n) as the mode-n flattening of D (Kolda, 2002).","Similar with a matrix, an N th-order tensor can be decomposed through “N -mode singular value decomposition (SVD)”, which is a an extension of SVD that expresses the tensor as the mode-n product of N -orthogonal spaces. D = Z ×1 U1 ×2 U2 · · · ×n Un · · · ×N UN . (1) Tensor Z, known as the core tensor, is analogous to the diagonal singular value matrix in conventional matrix SVD. Z is in general a full tensor. The core tensor governs the in-teraction between the mode matrices Un, for n = 1, . . . , N . Mode matrix Un contains the orthogonal left singular vectors of the mode-n flattened matrix D(n).","The N -mode SVD algorithm for decomposing D is as follows:","1.

We can use a 3-order tensor D ∈ RK×3×T","to represent the collection, where T is the number of terms. The first dimension corresponds to entries, the second dimension, to parts and the third dimension, to the terms.","For example, the flattened matrix of CQA tensor with “terms” direction is composed by three sub-matrices MTitle, MContent and MAnswer, as was illustrated in Figure 1. Each sub-matrix is equivalent to the traditional document-term matrix. Figure 1: Flattening CQA tensor with “terms” (right matrix)and “entries” (bottom matrix) Denote pi,j to be part j of entry i. Then we 436 have the term frequency, defined as follows. tfi,j,k = ni,j,k","∑ i ni,j,k , (2) where ni,j,k is the number of occurrences of the considered term (tk) in pi,j, and the denominator is the sum of number of occurrences of all terms in pi,j.","The inverse document frequency is a measure of the general importance of the term. idfj,k = log |K| 1 +","∑ i I(tk ∈ pi,j) , (3) where |K| is the total number of entries and I(·) is the indicator function.","Then the element di,j,k of tensor D is di,j,k = tfi,j,k × idfj,k.
