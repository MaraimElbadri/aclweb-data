Building on this, an event date extraction system learns to integrate the likelihood of candidate dates extracted from time-rich sentences with temporal constraints extracted from event-related sentences. Our integrated model achieves 89.7% of the maximum performance given the performance of the temporal expression retrieval step."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In this paper we present a challenging new event date extraction task. Our technical contribution is a temporal tagger that outperforms previously published baseline approaches in its ability to identify informal temporal expressions (TE) and that normalizes each of them to an actual month and year (Chang and Manning, 2012; Strotgen and Gertz, 2010). This temporal tagger then contributes towards high performance at matching event mentions with the month and year in which they occurred based on the complete posting history of users. It does so with high accuracy on informal event mentions in social media by learning to integrate the likelihood of multiple candidate dates extracted from event mentions in time-rich sentences with temporal constraints extracted from event-related sentences.","Despite considerable prior work in temporal information extraction, to date state-of-the-art re-sources are designed for extracting temporally scoped facts about public figures/organizations from newswire or Wikipedia articles (Ji et al., 2011; McClosky and Manning, 2012; Garrido et [11/15/2008] I have noticed some pulling recently and I won't start rads until March. [11/20/2008] It is sloowwwly healing, so slowly, in fact, that she said she HOPES it will be healed by March, when I am supposed to start rads. [1/13/2009] I still have one last chemo to go on the 19th and then start rads in 5 wks. [1/31/2009] I go for my first meeting with the rad onc on 2/10 (my 50th birthday!). [2/23/2009] I had my first rad today. [3/31/2009] Tomorrow will be my last full rads [4/2/2009] I started rads in Feb, just did #29 today. [4/8/2009] The rad onc wants to see me again next week for a skin check as I have had cellulitis twice since August. [6/21/2010] My friend Lisa had her port put in last week and will begin 2 weeks of radiation on Tuesday. Figure 1: User posts containing keywords for the start of Radiation. Event keywords are in bold and temporal expressions are in italics. al., 2012). When people are instead communicating informally about their lives, they refer to time more informally and frequently from their personal frame of reference rather than from an impersonal third person frame of reference. For example, they may use their own birthday as a time reference. The proportion of relative (e.g., “last week”, “two days from now”), or personal time references in our data is more than one and a half times as high as in newswire and Wikipedia. Therefore, it is not surprising that there would be difficulty in applying a temporal tagger designed for newswire to social media data (Strotgen and Gertz, 2012; Kolomiyets et al., 2011). Recent be-havioral studies (Choudhury et al., 2013; Park and Choi, 2012; Wen et al., 2012) demonstrate that user-focused event mentions extracted from social media data can provide a useful timeline-like tool for studying how behavior patterns change over time in response to mentioned events. Our research contributes towards automating this work."]},{"title":"2 Task","paragraphs":["Our task is to extract personal illness events mentioned in the posting histories of online community participants. The input to our system is 836 a candidate event and a posting history. The output is the event date (month and year) for the event if it occurred, or “unknown” if it did not occur. The process iterates through a list of 10 cancer events (CEs). This list includes breast cancer Diagnosis, Metastasis, Recurrence, Mastectomy, Lumpectomy, Reconstruction, Chemotherapy-Start, Chemotherapy-End, Radiation-Start and Radiation-End. For each of these target CEs, we manually designed an event keyword set that includes the name of the event, abbreviations, slang, aliases and related words.","For each of the 10 events, all sentences that mention a related event keyword are extracted from the user’s posting history. Figure 1 shows sevaral sentences that were extracted for one user for the start date of Radiation. The task is to determine that the beginning of this user’s Radiation therapy was 2/2009. Note that the user began to post about Radiation before she started it. She first reported planning to start Radiation in March, but then rescheduled for February. Most of the TEs are non-standard and need to be resolved to calendar dates (year and month).","Once the full set of event mention sentences has been extracted for a user, all the temporal expressions (TEs) that appear in the same sentence with an event mention are resolved to a set of candidate dates. Besides a standard event-time classifier for within-sentence event-time anchoring, we leverage a new source of temporal information to train a constraint-based event-time classifier. Previous work only retrieves time-rich sentences that include both the query and some TEs (Ji et al., 2011; McClosky and Manning, 2012; Garrido et al., 2012). However, sentences that contain only the event mention but no explicit TE can also be informative. For example, the post time (usually referred to as document creation time or DCT) of the sentence “metastasis was found in my bone” might be labeled as being after the “metastasis” event date. These DCTs impose constraints on the possible event dates, which can be integrated with the event-time classifier, as a variant on related work(Chambers, 2012)."]},{"title":"3 Related Work","paragraphs":["Previous work on TE extraction has focused mainly on newswire text (Strotgen and Gertz, 2010; Chang and Manning, 2012). This paper presents a rule-based TE extractor that identifies and resolves a higher percentage of nonstandard TEs than earlier state-of-art temporal taggers.","Our task is closest to the temporal slot filling track in the TAC-KBP 2011 shared task (Ji et al., 2011) and timelining task (McClosky and Manning, 2012). Their goal was to extract the temporal bounds of event relations. Our task has two key differences. First, they used newswire, Wikipedia and blogs as data sources from which they extract temporal bounds of facts found in Wikipedia in-foboxes. Second, in the KBP task, the set of gold event relations are provided as input, so that the task is only to identify a date for an event that is guaranteed to have been mentioned. In our task, we provide a set of potential events. However, most of the candidate events won’t have ever been reported within a user’s posting history.","Temporal constraints have proven to be useful for producing a globally consistent timeline. In most temporal relation bound extraction systems, the constraints are included as input rather than learned by the system (Talukdar et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011). A notable exception is Mc-Closkyet al. (2012) who developed an approach to learning constraints such as that people cannot at-tend school if they have not been born yet. A notable characteristic of our task is that constraints are softer. Diseases may occur in very different ways across patients. Recurring illnesses falsely appear to have an unpredictable order. Thus, there can be no universal logical constraints on the order of cancer events.","Our approach to using temporal constraints is a variant on previously published approaches. Garrido et al. (2012) made use of DCT (document creation time) as well, however, they have assumed the DCT is within the time-range of the event stated in the document, which is often not true in our data. Chambers (2012) utilized the within-sentence time-DCT relation to learn constrains for predicting DCT. We learn the event-DCT relations to produce constrains for the event date."]},{"title":"4 Corpus Annotation","paragraphs":["We have scraped the posts, users, and profiles from a large online cancer support community. From this collection we extracted and then annotated two separate corpora, one for evaluating our TE retrieval and normalization, the other one for event date extraction.","For creating the TE extraction corpus, we ran-837 domly picked one post from each of 1,000 randomly selected users. We used this sampling technique because each user tends to use a narrow range of date expression forms. From these posts, we manually extracted 601 TEs and resolved them to a specific month and year or just year if the month was not mentioned. Events not reported to have occurred were annotated as “unknown”. Our corpus for event date extraction consists of the complete posting history of 300 users that were randomly drawn from our dataset. Three annotators were provided with guidelines for how to in-fer the date of the events (Wen et al., 2013). We achieved .94 Kappa on identification of whether an event has a reported event date in a user’s history or not. In evaluation of agreement on extracted dates, we achieved a .99 Cronbach’s alpha. From this corpus, 509 events were annotated with occurrence dates (year and month). In our evaluation, we use data from 250 users for training, and 50 for testing."]},{"title":"5 Method","paragraphs":["Now we explain on a more technical level how our system works on our task. Given an event and a user’s post history, the system searches for all of the sentences that contain an event keyword (keyword sentence) and all the sentences that contain both a keyword and a TE (date sentence). The TEs in the date sentences are resolved and then used as candidate dates for the event. For selecting among candidate dates, our model integrates two main components. First, the Date Classifier is trained from date sentences to predict how likely its candidate TE and the gold event date are to overlap. Then, because constraints over event dates can be informed by temporal relations between the event date and the DCT, the Constraint-based Classifier provides an indication of the plausibility of candidate dates. The integrated system combines the predictions from both classifiers. 5.1 Temporal Tagger We design a rule-based temporal tagger that is built using regular expression patterns to recognize informal TEs. Similar to SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012), we identify and resolve a wide range of non-standard TE types such as “Feb ’07 (2/2007)”. The additional types of TE we handle include: 1)user-specific TEs: A user’s age, cancer anniversary and survivorship can provide temporal information about the user’s CEs. We obtain the birth date of users from their personal profile to resolve age date expressions such as “at the age of 57”. 2)non-whole numbers such as “a year and half” and “1/2 weeks”. 3) abbreviations of time units : e.g. “wk” as the abbreviation of “week”. 4) underspecified month mentions, we resolve the year information according to the DCT month, the mentioned month and the verb tense. 5.2 Date Classifier We train a MaxEnt classifier to predict the temporal relationship between the retrieved TE and the event date as overlap or no-overlap, similar to the within-sentence event-time anchoring task in TempEval-2 (UzZaman and Allen, 2010). Features for the classifier include many of those in (McClosky and Manning, 2012; Yoshikawa et al., 2009): namely, event keyword and its dominant verb, verb and preposition that dominate TE, dependency path between TE and keyword and its length, unigram and bigram word and POS features. New features include the Event-Subject, Negative and Modality features. In online support groups, users not only tell stories about themselves, they also share other patients’ stories (as shown in Figure 1). So we add subject features to remove this kind of noise, which includes the governing subject of the event keyword and its POS tag. Modality features include the appearance of modals before the event keyword (e.g., may, might). Negative features include the presence/absence of negative words (e.g., no, never). These two features indicate a hypothetical or counter-factual expression of the event.","To calculate the likelihood of a candidate date for an event, we need to aggregate the hard decisions from the classifier. Let DSu be the set of the user’s date sentences, let Du be the set of dates resolved from each TE. We represent a MaxEnt classifier byPrelation(R|t, ds) for a candidate date t in date sentence ds and possible relation R = {overlap, no-overlap}. We map the distribution over relations to a distribution over dates by definingPDateSentence(t|DSu): PDateSentence(t|DSu) = (1)","1 Z(Du) ∑ tj∈Du δtj (t)Prelation(overlap|tj, dsj) δtj (t) =","{ 1 if t = tj 0 otherwise 838 We refer to this model as the Date Classifier. 5.3 Constraint-based Classifier Previous work only retrieves time-rich sentences (i.e., date sentences) (Ling and Weld, 2010; Ji et al., 2011; McClosky and Manning, 2012; Garrido et al., 2012). However, keyword sentences can in-form temporal constraints for events and therefore should not be ignored. For example, “Well, I’m officially a Radiation grad!” indicates the user has done radiation by the time of the post (DCT). “Radiation is not a choice for me.” indicates the user probably never had radiation. The topic of the sentence can also indicate the temporal relation. For example, before chemotherapy, the users tend to talk about choices of drug combinations. After chemotherapy, they talk about side-effects.","This section departs from the above Date Classifier and instead predicts whether each keyword sentence is posted before or overlap-or-after the user’s event date. The goal is to automatically learn time constraints for the event. This task is similar to the sentence event-DCT ordering task in TempEval-2 (UzZaman and Allen, 2010). We create training examples by computing the temporal relation between the DCT and the user’s gold event date. If the user has not reported an event date, the label should be unknown.","We train a MaxEnt classifier on each event mention paired with its corresponding DCT. All the features used in the classifier component that are not related to the TEs are included. Let KSu be the set of the user’s keyword sentences, let Du be the set of dates resolved from each date sentence. We define a MaxEnt classifier by Prelation(R|ks) for a keyword sentence ks and possible relation R = {before, overlap-or-after, unknown}. DCT is the post time of the keyword sentence ks. The rel(DCT, t) function simply determines if the DCT is before or overlap-or-after the candidate date t. We map this distribution over relations to a distribution over dates by defining PKeywordSentence(t, KSu): PKeywordSentence(t, KSu) = (2)","1 Z(Du) ∑ ksj∈KSu Prelation(rel(dctj, t)|ksj) rel(dct, t) =","{ before if dct < t overlap-or-after if dct ≥ t 5.4 Integrated Model Given the Date Classifier of Section 5.2 and the Constraint-based Classifier of Section 5.3, we create a Integrated Model combining the two with the following linear interpolation as follows: P (t|postsu) = λPDateSentence(t|DSu) + (1 − λ)PKeywordSentence(t|KSu) where t is a candidate event date. The system will output t that maximizes P (t|postsu) and unknown if DSu is empty. λ was set to 0.7 by maximizing accuracy using five-fold cross-validation over the training set."]},{"title":"6 Evaluation Metric and Results 6.1 Temporal Expression Retrieval","paragraphs":["We compare our temporal tagger’s performance with SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012) on the 601 manually extracted TEs. We exclude user-specific TEs such as birthday references since SUTime cannot handle those. We first evaluate identification of the extent of a TE and then production of the correctly resolved date for each recognized expression. Table 1 shows that our tagger has significantly higher precision and recall for both.","P R F1","Extents SUTime 97.5 75.4 85.0 Our tagger 97.9 91.8 94.8","Normalization SUTime 89.4 71.2 79.3 Our tagger 91.3 85.5 88.3 Table 1: Temporal expression retrieval results 6.2 Event-date Extraction 6.2.1 Evaluation metric The extracted date is only considered correct if it completely matches the gold date. For less than 4% of users, we have multiple dates for the same event (e.g., a user had a mastectomy twice). Similar to the evaluation metric in a previous study(Ji et al., 2011), in these cases, we give the system the benefit of the doubt and the extracted date is considered correct if it matches one of the gold dates. In previous work (McClosky and Manning, 2012; Ji et al., 2011), the evaluation metric score is defined as 1/((1 + |d|)) where d is the difference between the values in years. We choose a much stricter evaluation metric because we need a precise event date to study user behavior changes. 6.2.2 Baselines and oracle Based on our temporal tagger, we provide two baselines to describe heuristic methods of aggregating the hard decisions from the classifier 839","Baseline1 Baseline2 Date Integrated Oracle","CE count P R F1 P R F1 P R F1 P R F1 F1 Diagnosis 112 .64 .70 .67 .60 .66 .63 .68 .75 .71 .68 .75 .71 .80 Metastasis 7 .16 .58 .25 .12 .43 .19 .25 .86 .39 .25 .86 .39 .86 Recurrence 14 .14 .35 .20 .11 .29 .16 .13 .36 .19 .13 .36 .19 .47 Chemo-start 54 .49 .61 .54 .42 .52 .46 .52 .66 .58 .58 .74 .65 .76 Chemo-end 43 .44 .59 .50 .36 .49 .42 .47 .63 .54 .48 .66 .56 .84 Rad-start 38 .35 .47 .40 .30 .40 .34 .36 .47 .41 .40 .53 .46 .64 Rad-end 35 .48 .63 .54 .30 .39 .34 .50 .66 .57 .50 .66 .57 .84 Mastectomy 68 .58 .71 .64 .52 .62 .57 .62 .76 .68 .62 .76 .68 .77 Lumpectomy 33 .49 .71 .58 .43 .76 .46 .46 .79 .58 .46 .79 .62 .91 Reconstruction 43 .38 .57 .46 .29 .44 .35 .41 .63 .50 .43 .65 .52 .86","Table 2: Event-level five-fold cross-validation performance of models and baselines on training data. learned in Section 5.3. The first baseline, Baseline1, is to pick the date with the highest classifier’s prediction confidence. The second baseline, Baseline2, is along the same lines as the Combined Classifier used in (McClosky and Manning, 2012). For example, if the candidate date is “6/2009” and we have retrieved two TEs that are resolved to “6/2009” and “4/2008”, then P (“6/2009”) = Prelation(overlap|“6/2009”) × Prelation(no-overlap|“4/2008”).","To set an upper bound on performance given our TE retrieval system, we calculate the oracle score by considering an extraction as correct if the gold date is one of the retrieved candidate dates. The oracle score can differ from a perfect score since we can only use candidate temporal expressions if (a)the relation is known and (b)mentions of the event are retrievable, (c)the TE and event keyword appear in the same sentence, and (d)our temporal tagger is able to recognize and resolve it correctly. 6.2.3 Results We present the performance of our models, baselines and the oracle in Table 2. Both the Date Classifier and Integrated model significantly outperform the baselines (p < 0.0001, McNemar’s test, 2-tailed). This shows the value of our approach to leveraging redundancy of event date mentions. In-corporating time constraints further improves the F1 of the Date Classifier by 3%.

The Joint Model derives most of its improvement from performance related to the Chemotherapy/Radiation-start date. This is mainly because Chemotherapy and Radiation last for a period of time and there are more event-related discussions containing the event keyword. None of our systems improves on cancer Metastasis and Recurrence. This is likely due to the sparsity of these events."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We presented a novel event date extraction task that requires extraction and resolution of non-standard TEs, namely personal illness event dates, from the posting histories of online community participants. We constructed an evaluation corpus and designed a temporal tagger for non-standard TEs in social media.

By creating an analogous keyword set, our event date extraction method could be easily adapted to other datasets."]},{"title":"8 Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We want to thank Dong Nguyen and Yi-chia Wang, who helped provide the data for this project.
