With the growth of the available data across different domains, it is computationally demanding to perform batch training every time when new data comes. In face of the problem, we propose an efficient phrase table combination method. In particular, we train a Bayesian phrasal inversion transduction grammars for each domain separately. The learned phrase tables are hierarchically combined as if they are drawn from a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process. The performance measured by BLEU is at least as comparable to the traditional batch training method. Further-more, each phrase table is trained separately in each domain, and while computational overhead is significantly reduced by training them in parallel."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Statistical machine translation (SMT) systems usually achieve ’crowd-sourced’ improvements with batch training. Phrase pair extraction, the key step to discover translation knowledge, heavily relies on the scale of training data. Typically, the more parallel corpora used, the more phrase pairs and more accurate parameters will be learned, which can obviously be beneficial to improving translation performances. Today, more parallel sentences are drawn from divergent domains, and the size keeps growing. Consequently, how to effectively use those data and improve translation performance becomes a challenging is-sue.","This joint work was done while the first author visited NICT.","Batch retraining is not acceptable for this case, since it demands serious computational overhead when training on a large data set, and it requires us to re-train every time new training data is available. Even if we can handle the large computation cost, improvement is not guaranteed every time we perform batch tuning on the newly updated training data obtained from divergent domains. Traditional domain adaption methods for SMT are also not adequate in this scenario. Most of them have been proposed in order to make translation systems perform better for resource-scarce domains when most training data comes from resourcerich domains, and ignore performance on a more generic domain without domain bias (Wang et al., 2012). As an alternative, incremental learning may resolve the gap by incrementally adding data sentence-by-sentence into the training data. Since SMT systems trend to employ very large scale training data for translation knowledge extraction, updating several sentence pairs each time will be annihilated in the existing corpus.","This paper proposes a new phrase table combination method. First, phrase pairs are extracted from each domain without interfering with other domains. In particular, we employ the non-parametric Bayesian phrasal inversion transduction grammar (ITG) of Neubig et al. (2011) to perform phrase table extraction. Second, extracted phrase tables are combined as if they are drawn from a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process, in which the phrase tables represented as tables in the Chinese restaurant process (CRP) are hierarchically chained by treating each of the previously learned phrase tables as prior to the current one. Thus, we can easily update the chain of phrase tables by appending the newly extracted phrase table and by treating the chain of the previous ones as its prior.","Experiment results indicate that our method can achieve better translation performance when there exists a large divergence in domains, and can 802 achieve at least comparable results to batch training methods, with a significantly less computational overhead.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce related work. In section 3, we briefly describe the translation model with phrasal ITGs and Pitman-Yor process. In section 4, we explain our hierarchical combination approach and give experiment results in section 5. We conclude the paper in the last section."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Bilingual phrases are cornerstones for phrase-based SMT systems (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2005) and existing translation systems often get ‘crowd-sourced’ improvements (Levenberg et al., 2010). A number of approaches have been proposed to make use of the full potential of the available parallel sentences from various domains, such as domain adaptation and incremental learning for SMT.","The translation model and language model are primary components in SMT. Previous work proved successful in the use of large-scale data for language models from diverse domains (Brants et al., 2007; Schwenk and Koehn, 2008). Alternatively, the language model is incrementally updated by using a succinct data structure with a interpolation technique (Levenberg and Osborne, 2009; Levenberg et al., 2011).","In the case of the previous work on translation modeling, mixed methods have been investigated for domain adaptation in SMT by adding domain information as additional labels to the original phrase table (Foster and Kuhn, 2007). Under this framework, the training data is first divided into several parts, and phase pairs are extracted with some sub-domain features. Then all the phrase pairs and features are tuned together with different weights during decoding. As a way to choose the right domain for the domain adaption, a classifier-based method and a feature-based method have been proposed. Classification-based methods must at least add an explicit label to indicate which domain the current phrase pair comes from. This is traditionally done with an automatic domain classifier, and each input sentence is classified into its corresponding domain (Xu et al., 2007). As an alternative to the classification-based approach, Wang et al. (2012) employed a feature-based approach, in which phrase pairs are enriched by a feature set to potentially reflect the domain information. The similarity calculated by a information retrieval system between the training subset and the test set is used as a feature for each parallel sentence (Lu et al., 2007). Monolingual topic information is taken as a new feature for a domain adaptive translation model and tuned on the development set (Su et al., 2012). Regardless of under-lying methods, either classifier-based or feature-based method, the performance of current domain adaptive phrase extraction methods is more sensitive to the development set selection. Usually the domain similar to a given development data is usually assigned higher weights.","Incremental learning in which new parallel sentences are incrementally updated to the training data is employed for SMT. Compared to traditional frequent batch oriented methods, an online EM algorithm and active learning are applied to phrase pair extraction and achieves almost comparable translation performance with less computational overhead (Levenberg et al., 2010; González-Rubio et al., 2011). However, their methods usually require numbers of hyperparameters, such as mini-batch size, step size, or human judgment to determine the quality of phrases, and still rely on a heuristic phrase extraction method in each phrase table update."]},{"title":"3 Phrase Pair Extraction with Unsupervised Phrasal ITGs","paragraphs":["Recently, phrase alignment with ITGs (Cherry and Lin, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008; Blunsom et al., 2008) and parameter estimation with Gibb-s sampling (DeNero and Klein, 2008; Blunsom and Cohn, 2010) are popular. Here, we employ a method proposed by Neubig et al. (2011), which uses parametric Bayesian inference with the phrasal ITGs (Wu, 1997). It can achieve comparable translation accuracy with a much smaller phrase table than the traditional GIZA++ and heuristic phrase extraction methods. It has also been proved successful in adjusting the phrase length granularity by applying character-based SMT with more sophisticated inference (Neubig et al., 2012).","ITG is a synchronous grammar formalism which analyzes bilingual text by introducing in-verted rules, and each ITG derivation corresponds to the alignment of a sentence pair (Wu, 1997). Translation probabilities of ITG phrasal align-803 ments can be estimated in polynomial time by s-lightly limiting word reordering (DeNero and Klein, 2008).","More formally, P ( ⟨e, f ⟩; θx, θt )","are the probability of phrase pairs ⟨e, f ⟩, which is parameter-ized by a phrase pair distribution θt and a symbol distribution θx. θx is a Dirichlet prior, and θt is estimated with the Pitman-Yor process (Pitman and Yor, 1997; Teh, 2006), which is expressed as θt ∼ P Y ( d, s, Pdac ) (1) where d is the discount parameter, s is the strength parameter, and , and Pdac is a prior probability which acts as a fallback probability when a phrase pair is not in the model.","Under this model, the probability for a phrase pair found in a bilingual corpus ⟨E, F ⟩ can be represented by the following equation using the Chinese restaurant process (Teh, 2006): P ( ⟨ei, fi⟩; ⟨E, F ⟩ ) =","1 C + s (ci − d × ti)+","1 C + s (s + d × T ) × Pdac(⟨ei, fi⟩) (2) where","1. ci and ti are the customer and table count of the ith phrase pair ⟨ei, fi⟩ found in a bilingual corpus ⟨E, F ⟩;","2.

Generate symbol x from Px(x; θx) with three possible values: Base, REG, or IN V .","2. Depending on the value of x take the following actions. a. If x = Base, generate a new phrase pair directly from Pbase. b. If x = REG, generate ⟨e1, f1⟩ and ⟨e2, f2⟩ from P ( ⟨e, f ⟩; θx, θt )",", and concatenate them into a single phrase pair ⟨e1e2, f1f2⟩. Figure 1: A word alignment (a), and its hierarchical derivation (b).","c. If x = IN V , follow a similar process as b, but concatenate f1 and f2 in reverse order ⟨e1e2, f2f1⟩.","Note that the Pdac is recursively defined through the binary branched P , which in turns employs Pdac as a prior probability. Pbase is a base measure defined as a combination of the IBM Models in two directions and the unigram language models in both sides. Inference is carried out by a heuristic beam search based block sampling with an efficient look ahead for a faster convergence (Neubig et al., 2012).","Compared to GIZA++ with heuristic phrase extraction, the Bayesian phrasal ITG can achieve competitive accuracy under a smaller phrase table size. Further, the fallback model can incorporate phrases of all granularity by following the ITG’s recursive definition. Figure 1 (b) illustrates an example of the phrasal ITG derivation for word alignment in Figure 1 (a) in which a bilingual sentence pair is recursively divided into two through the recursively defined generative story."]},{"title":"4 Hierarchical Phrase Table Combination","paragraphs":["We propose a new phrase table combination method, in which individually learned phrase table are hierarchically chained through a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process.","Firstly, we assume that the whole training data ⟨E, F ⟩ can be split into J domains, {⟨E1",", F 1","⟩, . . . , ⟨EJ",", F J","⟩}. Then phrase pairs are 804 Figure 2: A hierarchical phrase table combination (a), and a basic unit of a Chinese restaurant process with K tables and N customers. extracted from each domain j (1 ≤ j ≤ J ) separately with the method introduced in Section 3. In traditional domain adaptation approaches, phrase pairs are extracted together with their probabilities and/or frequencies so that the extracted phrase pairs are merged uniformly or after scaling.","In this work, we extract the table counts for each phrase pair under the Chinese restaurant process given in Section 3. In Figure 2 (b), a CRP is illustrated which has K tables and N customers with each chair representing a customer. Meanwhile there are two parameters, discount and strength for each domain similar to the ones in Equation (1).","Our proposed hierarchical phrase table combination can be formally expressed as following:","θ1","∼ P Y (d1 , s1",", P 2",")","· · · · · ·","θj","∼ P Y (dj",", sj",", P j+1",") · · · · · · θJ","∼ P Y (","dJ , sJ , P J","base ) (3) Here the (j + 1)th layer hierarchical Pitman-Yor process is employed as a base measure for the jth layer hierarchical Pitman-Yor process. The hierarchical chain is terminated by the base measure from the J th domain P J","base. The hierarchical structure is illustrated in Figure 2 (a) in which the solid lines implies a fall back using the table counts from the subsequent domains, and the dotted lines means the final fallback to the base measure P J","base. When we query a probability of a phrase pair ⟨e, f ⟩, we first query the probability of the first layer P 1","(⟨e, f ⟩). If ⟨e, f ⟩ is not in the model, we will fallback to the next level of P 2","(⟨e, f ⟩). This process continues until we reach the Jth base measure of P J","(⟨e, f ⟩). Each fallback can be viewed as a translation knowledge integration process between subsequent domains.","For example in Figure 2 (a), the ith phrase pair ⟨ei, fi⟩ appears only in the domain 1 and domain 2, so its translation probability can be calculated by substituting Equation (3) with Equation (2): P ( ⟨ei, fi⟩; ⟨E, F ⟩ ) =","1","C1","+ s1 (c1","i − d1","× t1","i ) +","s1","+ d1 × T 1","(C1","+ s1",") × (C2","+ s2",") (c2","i − d2","× t2","i ) + J ∏ j=1","( sj + dj","× T j Cj","+ sj )","× P J base(⟨ei, fi⟩) (4) where the superscript indicates the domain for the corresponding counts, i.e. cj","i for the customer count in the jth domain. The first term in Equation (4) is the phrase probability from the first domain, and the second one comes from the second domain, but weighted by the fallback weight of the 1st domain. Since ⟨ei, fi⟩ does not appear in the rest of the layers, the last term is taken from all the fallback weight from the second layer to the J th layer with the final P J","base. All the parameters θj","and hyperparameters dj","and sj",", are obtained by learning on the jth domain. Returning the hyperparameters again when cascading another domain may improve the performance of the combination weight, but we will leave it for future work. The hierarchical process can be viewed as an in-stance of adapted integration of translation knowledge from each sub-domain. 805 Algorithm 1 Translation Probabilities Estima-tion Input: cj","i , t j i , P","j","base, Cj",", T j",", dj","and sj","Output: The translation probabilities for each pair","1: for all phrase pair ⟨ei, fi⟩ do","2: Initialize the P (⟨ei, fi⟩) = 0 and wi = 1","3: for all domain ⟨Ej, Fj⟩ such that 1 ⩽ j ⩽","J − 1 do","4: if ⟨ei, fi⟩ ∈ ⟨Ej, Fj⟩ then","5: P (⟨ei, fi⟩) += wi × (C j i − dj","×","tj","i )/(Cj","+ sj )","6: end if","7: wi = wi × (sj + dj","× T j",")/(Cj","+ sj",")","8: end for","9: P (⟨ei, fi⟩) += wi × (CJ","i − dJ","× tJ","i + (sJ","+","dJ","× T J",") × P J","base(⟨ei, fi⟩))/(CJ","+ sJ",") 10: end for","Our approach has several advantages. First, each phrase pair extraction can concentrate on a small portion of domain-specific data without interfering with other domains. Since no tuning stage is involved in the hierarchical combination, we can easily include a new phrase table from a new domain by simply chaining them together. Second, phrase pair phrase extraction in each domain is completely independent, so it is easy to parallelize in a situation where the training data is too large to fit into a small amount of memory. Finally, new domains can be integrated incrementally. When we encounter a new domain, and if a phrase pair is completely new in terms of the model, the phrase pair is simply appended to the current model, and computed without the fallback probabilities, since otherwise, the phrase pair would be boosted by the fallback probabilities. Pitman-Yor process is also employed in n-gram language models which are hierarchically represented through the hierarchical Pitman-Yor process with switch priors to in-tegrate different domains in all the levels (Wood and Teh, 2009). Our work incrementally combines the models from different domains by directly employing the hierarchical process through the base measures."]},{"title":"5 Experiment","paragraphs":["We evaluate the proposed approach on the Chinese-to-English translation task with three data sets with different scales.","Data set Corpus #sent. pairs","IWSLT HIT 52, 603 BTEC 19, 975 Domain 1 47, 993 Domain 2 30, 272","FBIS Domain 3 49, 509 Domain 4 38, 228 Domain 5 55, 913","News 221, 915","News 95, 593","LDC Magazine 98, 335 Magazine 254, 488 Finance 86, 112 Table 1: The sentence pairs used in each data set. 5.1 Experiment Setup The first data set comes from the IWSLT2012 OLYMPICS task consisting of two training sets: the HIT corpus, which is closely related to the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, and the BTEC corpus, which is a multilingual speech corpus containing tourism-related sentences.

The method established the relationship between the out-of-domain bilingual corpus and in-domain monolingual corpora via topic distribution to estimate the translation probability. ø(ẽ| f̃ ) = ∑ tf ø(ẽ, tf | f̃ ) = ∑ tf ø(ẽ|tf , f̃ ) · P (tf | f̃ ) (5) where ø(ẽ|tf , f̃ ) is the probability of translating f̃ into ẽ given the source-side topic f̃ , P (tf | f̃ ) is the phrase-topic distribution of f.","The method we proposed is named Hier-combin. It extracts phrase pairs in the same way as the Pialign-linear.

Pialign is used with default parameters. The parameter ’samps’ is set to 5, which indicates 5 samples are generated for a sentence pair.","The IWSLT data consists of roughly 2, 000 sentences and 3, 000 sentences each from the HIT and BTEC for development purposes, and the test data consists of 1, 000 sentences. For the FBIS and LDC task, we used NIST MT 2002 and 2004 for development and testing purposes, consisting of 878 and 1, 788 sentences respectively. We employ Moses, an open-source toolkit for our experiment (Koehn et al., 2007).

The results are listed in Table 2. Our method significantly outperforms the baseline Pialign-linear. Except for the translation probabilities, the phrase pairs of two methods are exactly same, so the number of phrase pairs are equal in the two methods. Further more, the performance of the baseline Pialign-adaptive is also higher than the baseline Pialign-linear’s and lower than ours. This proves that the adaptive method 807 Methods Task Time(minute) Batch Retraining 536.9 Hierarchical Parallel Extraction 122.55","Combination Integrating 1.5","Total 124.05 Table 3: Minutes used for alignment and phase pair extraction in the FBIS data set. with monolingual topic information is useful in the tasks, but our approach with the hierarchical Pitman-Yor process can estimate more accurate translation probabilities based on all the data from various domains.","Compared with the GIZA-batch, our approach achieves competitive performance with a much smaller phrase table. The number of phase pairs generated by our method is only 73.9%, 52.7%, and 45.4% of the GIZA-batch’s respectively. In the IWLST2012 data set, there is a huge difference gap between the HIT corpus and the BTEC corpus, and our method gains 0.814 BLEU improvement. While the FBIS data set is artificially divided and no clear human assigned differences among sub-domains, our method loses 0.09 BLEU.","In the framework we proposed, phrase pairs are extracted from each domain completely independent of each other, so those tasks can be executed on different machines, at different times, and of course in parallel when we assume that the domains are not incrementally added in the training data. The runtime of our approach and the batch-based ITGs sampling method in the FBIS data set is listed in Table 3 measured on a 2.7 GHz E5-2680 CPU and 128 Gigabyte memory. When comparing the hier-combin with the pialign-batch, the BLEU scores are a little higher while the time spent for training is much lower, almost one quarter of the pialign-batch.","Even the performance of the pialign-linear is better than the Baseline GIZA-linear’s, which means that phrase pair extraction with hierarchical phrasal ITGs and sampling is more suitable for domain adaptation tasks than the combination GIZA++ and a heuristic method.","Generally, the hierarchical combination method exploits the nature of a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process and gains the advantage of its smoothing effect, and our approach can incrementally generate a succinct phrase table based on all the data from various domains with more accurate probabilities. Traditional SMT phrase pair extraction is batch-based, while our method has no obvious shortcomings in translation accuracy, not to men-tion efficiency. 5.2.2 Effect of Integration Order Here, we evaluate whether our hierarchical combination is sensitive to the order of the domains when forming a hierarchical structure. Through Equation (3), in our experiments, we chained the domains in the order listed in Table 1, which is in almost chronological order. Table 4 shows the BLEU scores for the three data sets, in which the order of combining phrase tables from each domain is alternated in the ascending and descending of the similarity to the test data. The similarity between the data from each domain and the test data is calculated using the perplexity measure with 5-gram language model. The model learned from the domain more similar to the test data is placed in the front so that it can largely influence the parameter computation with less backoff effects. There is a big difference between the two opposite order in IWSLT 2012 data set, in which more than one point of decline in BLEU score when taking the BTEC corpus as the first layer. Note that the perplexity of BTEC was 344.589 while that of HIT was 107.788. The result may indicate that our hierarchical phrase combination method is sensitive to the integration order when the training data is small and there exists large gap in the similarity. However, if most domains are similar (FBIS data set) or if there are enough parallel sentence pairs (NIST data set) in each domain, then the translation performances are almost similar even with the opposite integrating orders.","IWSLT FBIS LDC Descending 20.154 30.491 31.268 Ascending 19.066 30.388 31.254 Difference 1.088 0.103 0.014 Table 4: BLEU scores for the hierarchical model with different integrating orders.
