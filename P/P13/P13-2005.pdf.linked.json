Every day, they generate a huge number of messages, which give researchers an unprecedented opportunity to utilize the messages and the public opinions contained in them for a wide range of applications (Liu, 2012). In this paper, we use them for the application of stock index time series analysis.","Here are some example tweets upon querying the keyword “$aapl” (which is the stock symbol for Apple Inc.) in Twitter:","1. “Shanghai Oriental Morning Post confirming w Sources that $AAPL TV will debut in May, Prices range from $1600-$3200, but $32,000 for a 50\"wow.”","2. “$AAPL permanently lost its bid for a ban on U.S. sales of the Samsung Galaxy Nex-us http://dthin.gs/XqcY74.”","3. “$AAPL is loosing customers. everybody is buying android phones! $GOOG.”","As shown, the retrieved tweets may talk about Apple’s products, Apple’s competition relationship with other companies, etc. These messages are often related to people’s sentiments about Apple Inc., which can affect or reflect its stock trading since positive sentiments can impact sales and financial gains. Naturally, this hints that topic based sentiment is a useful factor to consider for stock prediction as they reflect people’s sentiment on different topics in a certain time frame.","This paper focuses on daily one-day-ahead prediction of stock index based on the temporal characteristics of topics in Twitter in the recent past. Specifically, we propose a non-parametric topic-based sentiment time series approach to analyzing the streaming Twitter data. The key motivation here is that Twitter’s streaming messages reflect fresh sentiments of people which are likely to be correlated with stocks in a short time frame. We also analyze the effect of training window size which best fits the temporal dynamics of stocks. Here window size refers to the number of days of tweets used in model building.","Our final prediction model is built using vector autoregression (VAR). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use non-parametric continuous topic based Twitter sentiments for stock prediction in an autoregressive framework."]},{"title":"2 Related Work 2.1 Market Prediction and Social Media","paragraphs":["Stock market prediction has attracted a great deal of attention in the past. Some recent researches suggest that news and social media such as blogs, micro-blogs, etc., can be analyzed to extract public sentiments to help predict the market (Lavrenko et al., 2000; Schumaker and Chen, 2009). Bollen et al. (2011) used tweet based public mood to predict the movement of Dow Jones","* The work was done when the first author was visiting University of Illinois at Chicago.       24 Industrial Average index. Ruiz et al. (2012) studied the relationship between Twitter activities and stock market under a graph based view. Feldman et al. (2011) introduced a hybrid approach for stock sentiment analysis based on companies’ news articles. 2.2 Aspect and Sentiment Models Topic modeling as a task of corpus exploration has attracted significant attention in recent years. One of the basic and most widely used models is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003). LDA can learn a predefined number of topics and has been widely applied in its extended forms in sentiment analysis and many other tasks (Mei et al., 2007; Branavan et al., 2008; Lin and He, 2009; Zhao et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010; Brody and Elhadad, 2010; Jo and Oh, 2011; Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Sauper et al., 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012; He et al., 2012).","The Dirichlet Processes Mixture (DPM) model is a non-parametric extension of LDA (Teh et al., 2006), which can estimate the number of topics inherent in the data itself. In this work, we employ topic based sentiment analysis using DPM on Twitter posts (or tweets). First, we employ a DPM to estimate the number of topics in the streaming snapshot of tweets in each day.","Next, we build a sentiment time series based on the estimated topics of daily tweets. Lastly, we regress the stock index and the sentiment time series in an autoregressive framework."]},{"title":"3 Model","paragraphs":["We now present our stock prediction framework. 3.1 Continuous DPM Model Comparing to edited articles, it is much harder to preset the number of topics to best fit continuous streaming Twitter data due to the large topic diversity in tweets. Thus, we resort to a non-parametric approach: the Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) model, and let the model estimate the number of topics inherent in the data itself.","Mixture model is widely used in clustering and","can be formalized as follows: ∑ ( )","(1) where is a data point, is its cluster label, K is the number of topics, ( ) is the statistical (topic) models: * +","and","is the component weight satisfying and ∑ . In our setting of DPM, the number of mixture components (topics) K is unfixed apriori but estimated from tweets in each day. DPM is defined as in (Neal, 2010):","( )","","( ) (2) where is the parameter of the model that belongs to, and is defined as a Dirichlet Process with the base measure H and the concentration parameter (Neal, 2010).","We note that neighboring days may share the same or closely related topics because some topics may last for a long period of time covering multiple days, while other topics may just last for a short period of time. Given a set of time-stamped tweets, the overall generative process should be dynamic as the topics evolve over time. There are several ways to model this dynamic nature (Sun et al., 2010; Kim and Oh, 2011; Chua and Asur, 2012; Blei and Lafferty, 2006; Wang et al., 2008). In this paper, we follow the approach of Sun et al. (2010) due to its generality and extensibility.","Figure 1 shows the graphical model of our continuous version of DPM (which we call cDPM). As shown, the tweets set is divided into daily based collections: * + * + are the observed tweets and * +","are the model parameters (latent topics) that generate these tweets. For each subset of tweets, (tweets of day ), we build a DPM on it. For the first day ( ), the model functions the same as a standard DPM, i.e., all the topics use the same base measure, ( ). However, for later days ( ), besides the base measure, ( ), we make use of topics learned from previous days as priors. This ensures smooth topic chains or links (details in §3.2). For efficiency, we only consider topics of one previous day as priors.","We use collapsed Gibbs sampling (Bishop, 2006) for model inference. Hyper-parameters are set to: ; as in (Sun et al., 2010; Teh et al., 2006) which have been shown to work well. Because a tweet has at most 140 characters, we assume that each tweet contains only one topic. Hence, we only need to         Figure 1: Continuous DPM. ...          ","      ","  25 sample the topic assignment for each tweet .","According to different situations with respect to a topic’s prior, for each tweet in , the conditional distribution for given all other tweets’ topic assignments, denoted by , can be summarized as follows: 1.","is a new topic: Its candidate priors contain","the symmetric base prior ( ) and topics","* +","learned from ."," If takes a symmetric base prior: (",")","  ( ) ( ) ∏ ( )  ∏ ( )  (3) where the first part denotes the prior probability according to the Dirichlet Process and the second part is the data likelihood (this interpretation can similarly be applied to the following three equations)."," If","takes one topic k from * + as its prior: (",")   ( ) ( ) ∏ ( ( ) )  ∏ ( ( ))  (4)","2. k is an existing topic: We already know its prior.  If k takes a symmetric base prior:","( )   ","( ( )",")","( ( )",")","∏ (",")  ∏ (",")  (5)  If k takes topic as its prior: ( )   ",".

While ( )"," denotes the marginalized sum of all words in topic k with statistic from excluded. Similarly, the posteriors on * ( )+ (topic word distributions) are given according to their prior situations as follows:  If topic k takes the base prior: ( ) ( ) ( ( )) ⁄ (7) where is the frequency of word in topic k and ( ) is the marginalized sum over all words."," otherwise, it is defined recursively as: ( ) ( ( ) ) ( ( ))⁄ (8) where serves as the topic prior for . Finally, for each day we estimate the topic weights, as follows: ∑","⁄ (9) where is the number of tweets in topic k. 3.2 Topic-based Sentiment Time Series Based on an opinion lexicon (a list of positive and negative opinion words, e.g., good and bad), each opinion word, is assigned with a polarity label ( ) as “+1” if it is positive and “-1” if negative. We spilt each tweet’s text into opinion part and non-opinion part. Only non-opinion words in tweets are used for Gibbs sampling.","Based on DPM, we learn a set of topics from the non-opinion words space . The corresponding tweets’ opinion words share the same topic assignments as its tweet. Then, we compute the posterior on opinion word probability, ( ) for topic analogously to equations (7) and (8). Finally, we define the topic based sentiment score ( ) of topic in day t as a weighted linear combination of the opinion polarity labels:","( ) ∑","( )","( ); ( ) , - (10)","According to the generative process of cDPM, topics between neighboring days are linked if a topic k takes another topic as its prior. We regard this as evolution of topic k. Although there may be slight semantic variation, the assumption is reasonable. Then, the sentiment scores for each topic series form the sentiment time series {..., S(t-1, k), S(t, k), S(t+1, k), ...}.","Figure 2 demonstrates the linking process where a triangle denotes a new topic (with base symmetric prior), a circle denotes a middle topic (taking a topic from the previous day as its prior,     0 ... t-1 t t+1 ...

Figure 1: Continuous DPM   ... ...   ...   . . .   ...   ... ... 26 while also supplying prior for the next day) and an ellipse denotes an end topic (no further topics use it as a prior). In this example, two continuous topic chains or links (via linked priors) exist for the time interval [t-1, t+1]: one in light grey color, and the other in black. As shown, there may be more than one topic chain/link (5-20 in our experiments) for a certain time interval 1",".Thus, we sort multiple sentiment series according to their accumulative weights of topics over each link: ∑ . In our experiments, we try the top five series and use the one that gives the best result, which is mostly the first (top ranked) series with a few exceptions of the second series. The topics mostly focus on hot keywords like: news, stocknews, earning, report, which stimulate ac-tive discussions on the social media platform. 3.3 Time Series Analysis with VAR For model building, we use vector autoregression (VAR). The first order (time steps of historical information to use: lag = 1) VAR model for two time series * + and * + is given by:  (11) where * + are the white noises and * + are model parameters. We use the “dse” library 2","in the R language to fit our VAR model based on least square regression. Instead of training in one period and predicting over another disjointed period, we use a moving training and prediction process under sliding windows3","(i.e., train in [t, t + w] and predict index on t + w + 1) with two main considerations:  Due to the dynamic and random nature of both","the stock market and public sentiments, we are","more interested in their short term relationship.  Based on the sliding windows, we have more","training and testing points. Figure 3 details the algorithm for stock index prediction. The accuracy is computed based on the index up and down dynamics, the function (",") returns True only if","(our prediction) and (actual value) share the same index up or down direction.   1 The actual topic priors for topic links are governed by the four cases of the Gibbs Sampler. 2 http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dse 3 This is similar to the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models."]},{"title":"4 Dataset","paragraphs":["We collected the tweets via Twitter’s REST API for streaming data, using symbols of the Standard & Poor's 100 stocks (S&P100) as keywords. In this study, we focus only on predicting the S&P100 index. The time period of our dataset is between Nov. 2, 2012 and Feb. 7, 2013, which gave us 624782 tweets. We obtained the S&P100 index’s daily close values from Yahoo Finance."]},{"title":"5 Experiment 5.1 Selecting a Sentiment Metric","paragraphs":["Bollen et al. (2011) used the mood dimension, Calm together with the index value itself to predict the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, their Calm lexicon is not publicly available. We thus are unable to perform a direct comparison with their system. We identified and labeled a Calm lexicon (words like “anxious”, “shocked”, “settled” and “dormant”) using the opinion lexicon4","of Hu and Liu (2004) and computed the sentiment score using the method of Bollen et al. (2011) (sentiment ratio). Our pilot experiments showed that using the full opinion lexicon of Hu and Liu (2004) actually performs consistently better than the Calm lexicon. Hence, we use the entire opinion lexicon in Hu and Liu (2004). 5.2 S&P100INDEX Movement Prediction We evaluate the performance of our method by comparing with two baselines. The first (Index) uses only the index itself, which reduces the VAR model to the univariate autoregressive model (AR), resulting in only one index time series { } in the algorithm of Figure 3.  4 http://cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/opinion-lexicon-English.rar Parameter: w: training window size; lag: the order of VAR; Input: : the date of time series; { }: sentiment time series; { }: index time series; Output: prediction accuracy. 1. for t = 0, 1, 2, ..., N-w-1 2. { 3. = VAR( , - , -, lag); 4.","= .Predict(x[t+w+1-lag, t+w], y[t+w+1-lag, t+w]); 5. if ( (",") ) rightNum++; 6. } 7. Accuracy = rightNum / (N-w); 8. Return Accuracy;","Figure 3: Prediction algorithm and accuracy          Figure 1: Continuous DPM 27 When considering Twitter sentiments, existing works (Bollen et al., 2011, Ruiz et al., 2012) simply compute the sentiment score as ratio of pos/neg opinion words per day. This generates a lexicon-based sentiment time series, which is then combined with the index value series to give us the second baseline Raw. In summary, Index uses index only with the AR model while Raw uses index and opinion lexicon based time series. Our cDPM uses index and the proposed topic based sentiment time series. Both Raw and cDPM employ the two dimensional VAR model. We experiment with different lag settings from 1-3 days. We also experiment with different training window sizes, ranging from 15 - 30 days, and compute the prediction accuracy for each window size. Table 1 shows the respective average and best accuracies over all window sizes for each lag and Table 2 summarizes the pairwise performance improvements of averaged scores over all training window sizes. Figure 4 show the detailed accuracy comparison for lag 1 and lag 3. From Table 1, 2, and Figure 4, we note: i. Topic-based public sentiments from tweets","can improve stock prediction over simple sen-","timent ratio which may suffer from backchan-","nel noise and lack of focus on prevailing top-","ics. For example, on lag 2, Raw performs","worse by 8.6% than Index itself. ii. cDPM outperforms all others in terms of both","the best accuracy (lag 3) and the average ac-","curacies for different window sizes. The max-","imum average improvement reaches 25.0%","compared to Index at lag 1 and 15.1% com-","pared to Raw at lag 3. This is due to the fact","that cDPM learns the topic based sentiments","instead of just using the opinion words’ ratio","like Raw, and in a short time period, some","topics are more correlated with the stock market than others. Our proposed sentiment time series using cDPM can capture this phenomenon and also help reduce backchannel noise of raw sentiments.","iii. On average, cDPM gets the best performance for training window sizes within [21, 22], and the best prediction accuracy is 68.0% on window size 22 at lag 3."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions","paragraphs":["Predicting the stock market is an important but difficult problem. This paper showed that Twitter’s topic based sentiment can improve the prediction accuracy beyond existing non-topic based approaches. Specifically, a non-parametric topic-based sentiment time series approach was proposed for the Twitter stream. For prediction, vector autoregression was used to regress S&P100 index with the learned sentiment time series. Besides the short term dynamics based prediction, we believe that the proposed method can be extended for long range dependency analysis of Twitter sentiments and stocks, which can render deep insights into the complex phenomenon of stock market. This will be part of our future work."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was supported in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grant no.
