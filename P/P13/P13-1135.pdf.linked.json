The Web is a comprehensive source of preexisting parallel text, but crawling the entire web is impossible for all but the largest companies. We bring web-scale parallel text to the masses by mining the Common Crawl, a public Web crawl hosted on Amazon’s Elastic Cloud. Starting from nothing more than a set of common two-letter language codes, our open-source extension of the STRAND algorithm mined 32 terabytes of the crawl in just under a day, at a cost of about $500. Our large-scale experiment uncovers large amounts of parallel text in dozens of language pairs across a variety of domains and genres, some previously unavailable in curated datasets. Even with minimal cleaning and filtering, the resulting data boosts translation performance across the board for five different language pairs in the news domain, and on open domain test sets we see improvements of up to 5 BLEU. We make our code and data available for other researchers seeking to mine this rich new data resource.1"]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["A key bottleneck in porting statistical machine translation (SMT) technology to new languages and domains is the lack of readily available parallel corpora beyond curated datasets. For a handful of language pairs, large amounts of parallel data","∗","This research was conducted while Chris Callison-Burch was at Johns Hopkins University.","1","github.com/jrs026/CommonCrawlMiner are readily available, ordering in the hundreds of millions of words for Chinese-English and Arabic-English, and in tens of millions of words for many European languages (Koehn, 2005). In each case, much of this data consists of government and news text. However, for most language pairs and domains there is little to no curated parallel data available. Hence discovery of parallel data is an important first step for translation between most of the world’s languages.","The Web is an important source of parallel text. Many websites are available in multiple languages, and unlike other potential sources— such as multilingual news feeds (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) or Wikipedia (Smith et al., 2010)— it is common to find document pairs that are direct translations of one another. This natural parallelism simplifies the mining task, since few resources or existing corpora are needed at the outset to bootstrap the extraction process.","Parallel text mining from the Web was originally explored by individuals or small groups of academic researchers using search engines (Nie et al., 1999; Chen and Nie, 2000; Resnik, 1999; Resnik and Smith, 2003). However, anything more sophisticated generally requires direct access to web-crawled documents themselves along with the computing power to process them. For most researchers, this is prohibitively expensive. As a consequence, web-mined parallel text has become the exclusive purview of large companies with the computational resources to crawl, store, and process the entire Web.","To put web-mined parallel text back in the hands of individual researchers, we mine parallel text from the Common Crawl, a regularly updated 81-terabyte snapshot of the public internet hosted 1374 on Amazon’s Elastic Cloud (EC2) service.2","Us-ing the Common Crawl completely removes the bottleneck of web crawling, and makes it possible to run algorithms on a substantial portion of the web at very low cost. Starting from nothing other than a set of language codes, our extension of the STRAND algorithm (Resnik and Smith, 2003) identifies potentially parallel documents using cues from URLs and document content (§2). We conduct an extensive empirical exploration of the web-mined data, demonstrating coverage in a wide variety of languages and domains (§3). Even without extensive pre-processing, the data improves translation performance on strong baseline news translation systems in five different language pairs (§4). On general domain and speech translation tasks where test conditions substantially differ from standard government and news training text, web-mined training data improves performance substantially, resulting in improvements of up to 1.5 BLEU on standard test sets, and 5 BLEU on test sets outside of the news domain."]},{"title":"2 Mining the Common Crawl","paragraphs":["The Common Crawl corpus is hosted on Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (S3). It can be downloaded to a local cluster, but the transfer cost is prohibitive at roughly 10 cents per gigabyte, making the total over $8000 for the full dataset.3 However, it is unnecessary to obtain a copy of the data since it can be accessed freely from Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) or Elastic MapReduce (EMR) services. In our pipeline, we perform the first step of identifying candidate document pairs using Amazon EMR, download the resulting document pairs, and perform the remain-ing steps on our local cluster. We chose EMR because our candidate matching strategy fit naturally into the Map-Reduce framework (Dean and Ghemawat, 2004).","Our system is based on the STRAND algorithm (Resnik and Smith, 2003):","1. Candidate pair selection: Retrieve candidate document pairs from the CommonCrawl corpus. 2. Structural Filtering: (a) Convert the HTML of each document 2 commoncrawl.org 3 http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/ into a sequence of start tags, end tags, and text chunks.","(b) Align the linearized HTML of candidate document pairs.","(c) Decide whether to accept or reject each pair based on features of the alignment.","3. Segmentation: For each text chunk, perform sentence and word segmentation.","4. Sentence Alignment: For each aligned pair of text chunks, perform the sentence alignment method of Gale and Church (1993).","5. Sentence Filtering: Remove sentences that appear to be boilerplate. Candidate Pair Selection We adopt a strategy similar to that of Resnik and Smith (2003) for finding candidate parallel documents, adapted to the parallel architecture of Map-Reduce.","The mapper operates on each website entry in the CommonCrawl data. It scans the URL string for some indicator of its language. Specifically, we check for: 1. Two/three letter language codes (ISO-639).","2. Language names in English and in the language of origin.","If either is present in a URL and surrounded by non-alphanumeric characters, the URL is identified as a potential match and the mapper outputs a key value pair in which the key is the original URL with the matching string replaced by *, and the value is the original URL, language name, and full HTML of the page. For example, if we en-counter the URL www.website.com/fr/, we output the following. • Key: www.website.com/*/","• Value: www.website.com/fr/, French, (full website entry)","The reducer then receives all websites mapped to the same “language independent” URL. If two or more websites are associated with the same key, the reducer will output all associated values, as long as they are not in the same language, as determined by the language identifier in the URL.","This URL-based matching is a simple and in-expensive solution to the problem of finding candidate document pairs. The mapper will discard 1375 most, and neither the mapper nor the reducer do anything with the HTML of the documents aside from reading and writing them. This approach is very simple and likely misses many good potential candidates, but has the advantage that it requires no information other than a set of language codes, and runs in time roughly linear in the size of the dataset. Structural Filtering A major component of the STRAND system is the alignment of HTML documents. This alignment is used to determine which document pairs are actually parallel, and if they are, to align pairs of text blocks within the documents.","The first step of structural filtering is to linearize the HTML. This means converting its DOM tree into a sequence of start tags, end tags, and chunks of text. Some tags (those usually found within text, such as “font” and “a”) are ignored during this step. Next, the tag/chunk sequences are aligned using dynamic programming. The objective of the alignment is to maximize the number of matching items.","Given this alignment, Resnik and Smith (2003) define a small set of features which indicate the alignment quality. They annotated a set of document pairs as parallel or non-parallel, and trained a classifier on this data. We also annotated 101 Spanish-English document pairs in this way and trained a maximum entropy classifier. However, even when using the best performing subset of features, the classifier only performed as well as a naive classifier which labeled every document pair as parallel, in both accuracy and F1. For this reason, we excluded the classifier from our pipeline. The strong performance of the naive baseline was likely due to the unbalanced nature of the annotated data— 80% of the document pairs that we annotated were parallel. Segmentation The text chunks from the previous step may contain several sentences, so before the sentence alignment step we must perform sentence segmentation. We use the Punkt sentence splitter from NLTK (Loper and Bird, 2002) to perform both sentence and word segmentation on each text chunk. Sentence Alignment For each aligned text chunk pair, we perform sentence alignment using the algorithm of Gale and Church (1993). Sentence Filtering Since we do not perform any boilerplate removal in earlier steps, there are many sentence pairs produced by the pipeline which contain menu items or other bits of text which are not useful to an SMT system. We avoid performing any complex boilerplate removal and only remove segment pairs where either the source and target text are identical, or where the source or target segments appear more than once in the extracted corpus."]},{"title":"3 Analysis of the Common Crawl Data","paragraphs":["We ran our algorithm on the 2009-2010 version of the crawl, consisting of 32.3 terabytes of data. Since the full dataset is hosted on EC2, the only cost to us is CPU time charged by Amazon, which came to a total of about $400, and data storage/transfer costs for our output, which came to roughly $100. For practical reasons we split the run into seven subsets, on which the full algorithm was run independently. This is different from running a single Map-Reduce job over the entire dataset, since websites in different subsets of the data cannot be matched. However, since the data is stored as it is crawled, it is likely that matching websites will be found in the same split of the data. Table 1 shows the amount of raw parallel data obtained for a large selection of language pairs.","As far as we know, ours is the first system built to mine parallel text from the Common Crawl. Since the resource is new, we wanted to under-stand the quantity, quality, and type of data that we are likely to obtain from it. To this end, we conducted a number of experiments to measure these features. Since our mining heuristics are very simple, these results can be construed as a lower bound on what is actually possible. 3.1 Recall Estimates Our first question is about recall: of all the possible parallel text that is actually available on the Web, how much does our algorithm actually find in the Common Crawl? Although this question is difficult to answer precisely, we can estimate an answer by comparing our mined URLs against a large collection of previously mined URLs that were found using targeted techniques: those in the French-English Gigaword corpus (Callison-Burch et al., 2011).","We found that 45% of the URL pairs would 1376","French German Spanish Russian Japanese Chinese","Segments 10.2M 7.50M 5.67M 3.58M 1.70M 1.42M","Source Tokens 128M 79.9M 71.5M 34.7M 9.91M 8.14M","Target Tokens 118M 87.5M 67.6M 36.7M 19.1M 14.8M","Arabic Bulgarian Czech Korean Tamil Urdu","Segments 1.21M 909K 848K 756K 116K 52.1K","Source Tokens 13.1M 8.48M 7.42M 6.56M 1.01M 734K","Target Tokens 13.5M 8.61M 8.20M 7.58M 996K 685K","Bengali Farsi Telugu Somali Kannada Pashto","Segments 59.9K 44.2K 50.6K 52.6K 34.5K 28.0K","Source Tokens 573K 477K 336K 318K 305K 208K","Target Tokens 537K 459K 358K 325K 297K 218K Table 1: The amount of parallel data mined from CommonCrawl for each language paired with English.

However, we chose not to include single letter identifiers in our experiments due to the high number of false positives they generated in preliminary experiments. 3.2 Precision Estimates Since our algorithms rely on cues that are mostly external to the contents of the extracted data and have no knowledge of actual languages, we wanted to evaluate the precision of our algorithm: how much of the mined data actually consists of parallel sentences?","To measure this, we conducted a manual analysis of 200 randomly selected sentence pairs for each of three language pairs. The texts are heterogeneous, covering several topical domains like tourism, advertising, technical specifications, finances, e-commerce and medicine. For German-English, 78% of the extracted data represent per-fect translations, 4% are paraphrases of each other (convey a similar meaning, but cannot be used for SMT training) and 18% represent misalignments. Furthermore, 22% of the true positives are potentially machine translations (judging by the quality), whereas in 13% of the cases one of the sentences contains additional content not ex-4 The difference is likely due to the coverage of the Com-","monCrawl corpus. pressed in the other. As for the false positives, 13.5% of them have either the source or target sentence in the wrong language, and the remain-ing ones representing failures in the alignment process. Across three languages, our inspection revealed that around 80% of randomly sampled data appeared to contain good translations (Table 2). Although this analysis suggests that language identification and SMT output detection (Venugopal et al., 2011) may be useful additions to the pipeline, we regard this as reasonably high precision for our simple algorithm. Language Precision Spanish 82% French 81% German 78% Table 2: Manual evaluation of precision (by sentence pair) on the extracted parallel data for Spanish, French, and German (paired with English).","In addition to the manual evaluation of precision, we applied language identification to our extracted parallel data for several additional languages. We used the “langid.py” tool (Lui and Baldwin, 2012) at the segment level, and report the percentage of sentence pairs where both sentences were recognized as the correct language. Table 3 shows our results. Comparing against our manual evaluation from Table 2, it appears that many sentence pairs are being incorrectly judged as non-parallel. This is likely because language identification tends to perform poorly on short segments. 1377 French German Spanish Arabic 63% 61% 58% 51% Chinese Japanese Korean Czech 50% 48% 48% 47% Russian Urdu Bengali Tamil 44% 31% 14% 12% Kannada Telugu Kurdish 12% 6.3% 2.9% Table 3: Automatic evaluation of precision through language identification for several languages paired with English. 3.3 Domain Name and Topic Analysis Although the above measures tell us something about how well our algorithms perform in aggregate for specific language pairs, we also wondered about the actual contents of the data. A major difficulty in applying SMT even on languages for which we have significant quantities of parallel text is that most of that parallel text is in the news and government domains. When applied to other genres, such systems are notoriously brittle. What kind of genres are represented in the Common Crawl data?","We first looked at the domain names which contributed the most data. Table 4 gives the top five domains by the number of tokens. The top two domain names are related to travel, and they account for about 10% of the total data.","We also applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; Blei et al., 2003) to learn a distribution over latent topics in the extracted data, as this is a popular exploratory data analysis method. In LDA a topic is a unigram distribution over words, and each document is modeled as a distribution over topics. To create a set of documents from the extracted CommonCrawl data, we took the English side of the extracted parallel segments for each URL in the Spanish-English portion of the data. This gave us a total of 444, 022 documents. In our first experiment, we used the MALLET toolkit (McCallum, 2002) to generate 20 topics, which are shown in Table 5.","Some of the topics that LDA finds correspond closely with specific domains, such as topics 1 (blingee.com) and 2 (opensubtitles.org). Several of the topics correspond to the travel domain. Foreign stop words appear in a few of the topics. Since our system does not include any language identification, this is not surprising.5","However it does suggest an avenue for possible improvement.","In our second LDA experiment, we compared our extracted CommonCrawl data with Europarl. We created a set of documents from both CommonCrawl and Europarl, and again used MALLET to generate 100 topics for this data.6","We then labeled each document by its most likely topic (as determined by that topic’s mixture weights), and counted the number of documents from Europarl and CommonCrawl for which each topic was most prominent. While this is very rough, it gives some idea of where each topic is coming from. Table 6 shows a sample of these topics.","In addition to exploring topics in the datasets, we also performed additional intrinsic evaluation at the domain level, choosing top domains for three language pairs. We specifically classified sentence pairs as useful or boilerplate (Table 7). Among our observations, we find that commercial websites tend to contain less boilerplate material than encyclopedic websites, and that the ratios tend to be similar across languages in the same domain.","FR ES DE www.booking.com 52% 71% 52% www.hotel.info 34% 44% - memory-alpha.org 34% 25% 55% Table 7: Percentage of useful (non-boilerplate) sentences found by domain and language pair. hotel.info was not found in our German-English data."]},{"title":"4 Machine Translation Experiments","paragraphs":["For our SMT experiments, we use the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007).

In these experiments, we use 5-gram language models when the target language is English or German, and 4-gram language models for French and Spanish. We tune model weights using minimum error rate training (MERT; Och, 2003) on the WMT 2008 test data. The results are given in Table 8. For all language pairs and both test sets (WMT 2011 and WMT 2012), we show an improvement of around 0.5 BLEU.","We also included the French-English Gigaword in separate experiments given in Table 9, and Table 10 compares the sizes of the datasets used. These results show that even on top of a different, larger parallel corpus mined from the web, adding CommonCrawl data still yields an improvement. 4.2 Open Domain Translation A substantial appeal of web-mined parallel data is that it might be suitable to translation of domains other than news, and our topic modeling analysis (§3.3) suggested that this might indeed be the case.

The advantage of this data for our open domain translation test is twofold. First, the Fisher dataset consists of conversations in various Spanish dialects on a wide variety of prompted topics. Second, because we obtained the translations ourselves, we could be absolutely assured that they did not appear in some form anywhere on the Web, making it an ideal blind test.","WMT10 Tatoeba Fisher","Europarl 89/72/46/20 94/75/45/18 87/69/39/13 +Wiki 92/78/52/24 96/80/50/21 91/75/44/15 +Web 96/82/56/27 99/88/58/26 96/83/51/19 +Both 96/84/58/29 99/89/60/27 96/83/52/20 Table 11: n-gram coverage percentages (up to 4-grams) of the source side of our test sets given our different parallel training corpora computed at the type level.","WMT10 Tatoeba Fisher","Europarl 27.21 36.13 46.32 +Wiki 28.03 37.82 49.34 +Web 28.50 41.07 51.13 +Both 28.74 41.12 52.23 Table 12: BLEU scores for Spanish-English before and after adding the mined parallel data to a baseline Europarl system.","We used 1000 sentences from each of the Tatoeba and Fisher datasets as test.

However, when web-mined parallel text is available to everyone at little or no cost, there will be much greater potential for groundbreaking research to come from all corners. With the advent of public services such as Amazon Web Services and the Common Crawl, this may soon be a reality. As we have shown, it is possible to obtain parallel text for many language pairs in a variety of domains very cheaply and quickly, and in sufficient quantity and quality to improve statistical machine translation systems. However, our effort has merely scratched the surface of what is possible with this resource. We will make our code and data available so that others can build on these results.","Because our system is so simple, we believe that our results represent lower bounds on the gains that should be expected in performance of systems previously trained only on curated datasets. There are many possible means through which the system could be improved, including more sophisticated techniques for identifying matching URLs, better alignment, better language identification, better filtering of data, and better exploitation of resulting cross-domain datasets. Many of the components of our pipeline were basic, leaving considerable room for improvement. For example, the URL matching strategy could easily be improved for a given language pair by spending a little time crafting regular expressions tailored to some major websites. Callison-Burch et al. (2011) gathered almost 1 trillion tokens of French-English parallel data this way. Another strategy for mining parallel webpage pairs is to scan the HTML for links to the same page in another language (Nie et al., 1999).","Other, more sophisticated techniques may also be possible. Uszkoreit et al. (2010), for example, translated all non-English webpages into English using an existing translation system and used near-duplicate detection methods to find candidate parallel document pairs. Ture and Lin (2012) had a similar approach for finding parallel Wikipedia documents by using near-duplicate detection, though they did not need to apply a full translation system to all non-English documents. 1381 Instead, they represented documents in bag-of-words vector space, and projected non-English document vectors into the English vector space using the translation probabilities of a word alignment model. By comparison, one appeal of our simple approach is that it requires only a table of language codes. However, with this system in place, we could obtain enough parallel data to bootstrap these more sophisticated approaches.","It is also compelling to consider ways in which web-mined data obtained from scratch could be used to bootstrap other mining approaches. For example, Smith et al. (2010) mine parallel sentences from comparable documents in Wikipedia, demonstrating substantial gains on open domain translation. However, their approach required seed parallel data to learn models used in a classifier. We imagine a two-step process, first obtaining parallel data from the web, followed by comparable data from sources such as Wikipedia using models bootstrapped from the web-mined data. Such a process could be used to build translation systems for new language pairs in a very short period of time, hence fulfilling one of the original promises of SMT."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["Thanks to Ann Irvine, Jonathan Weese, and our anonymous reviewers from NAACL and ACL for comments on previous drafts.
