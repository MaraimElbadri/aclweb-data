In fact, Kurdish is considered a bi-standard language (Gautier, 1998; Hassanpour et al., 2012): the Sorani dialect written in an Arabic-based alphabet and the Kurmanji dialect written in a Latin-based alphabet. The features distinguishing these two dialects are phonological, lexical, and morphological.","In this paper we report on the first outcomes of a project1","at University of Kurdistan (UoK) that aims at addressing these two challenges of the Kurdish language processing. More specifically, in this paper: 1. we report on the construction of the first relatively-large and publicly-available text corpus for the Kurdish language, 1 http://eng.uok.ac.ir/esmaili/research/klpp/en/main.htm","2. we present some insights into the orthographic, phonological, and morphological differences between Sorani Kurdish and Kurmanji Kurdish.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we first briefly introduce the Kurdish language and its two main dialects then underline their differences from a rule-based (a.k.a. corpus-independent) perspective. Next, after presenting the Pewan text corpus in Section 3, we use it to conduct a statistical comparison of the two dialects in Section 4. The paper is concluded in Section 5."]},{"title":"2 The Kurdish Language and Dialects","paragraphs":["Kurdish belongs to the Indo-Iranian family of Indo-European languages. Its closest betterknown relative is Persian. Kurdish is spoken in Kurdistan, a large geographical area spanning the intersections of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. It is one of the two official languages of Iraq and has a regional status in Iran.","Kurdish is a dialect-rich language, sometimes referred to as a dialect continuum (Matras and Akin, 2012; Shahsavari, 2010). In this paper, however, we focus on Sorani and Kurmanji which are the two closely-related and widely-spoken dialects of the Kurdish language. Together, they account for more than 75% of native Kurdish speakers (Walther and Sagot, 2010).","As summarized below, these two dialects differ not only in some linguistics aspects, but also in their writing systems. 2.1 Morphological Differences The important morphological differences are (MacKenzie, 1961; Haig and Matras, 2002; Samvelian, 2007):","1.

In spite the few attempts to build corpus (Gautier, 1998) and lexicon (Walther and Sagot, 2010), Kurdish still does not have any large-scale and reliable general or domain-specific corpus.","At UoK, we followed TREC (TREC, 2013)’s common practice and used news articles to build a text corpus for the Kurdish language. After surveying a range of options we chose two online news agencies: (i) Peyamner (Peyamner, 2013), a popular multi-lingual news agency based in Iraqi Kurdistan, and (ii) the Sorani (VOA, 2013b) and the Kurmanji (VOA, 2013a) websites of Voice Of America. Our main selection criteria were: (i) number of articles, (ii) subject diversity, and (iii) crawl-friendliness.","For each agency, we developed a crawler to fetch the articles and extract their textual content. In case of Peyamner, since articles have no language label, we additionally implemented a simple classifier that decides each page’s language","4","Although there are a handful of words with the latter in Kurmanji too. 301","Property Sorani Corpus Kurmanji Corpus No. of Articles","from VOA 18,420 5,699","from Peyamner 96,920 19,873","total 115,340 25,572 No. of distinct words 501,054 127,272 Total no. of words 18,110,723 4,120,027 Total no. of characters 101,564,650 20,138,939 Average word length 5.6 4.8 Table 1: The Pewan Corpus’s Basic Statistics based on the occurrence of language-specific characters.","Overall, 115,340 Sorani articles and 25,572 Kurmanji articles were collected5",". The articles are dated between 2003 and 2012 and their sizes range from 1KB to 154KB (on average 2.6KB). Table 1 summarizes the important properties of our corpus which we named Pewan –a Kurdish word meaning “measurement.”","Using Pewan and similar to the approach employed in (Savoy, 1999), we also built a list of Kurdish stopwords. To this end, we manually examined the top 300 frequent words of each dialect and removed the corpus-specific biases (e.g., “Iraq”, “Kurdistan”, “Regional”, “Government”, “Reported” and etc). The final Sorani and Kurmanji lists contain 157 and 152 words respectively, and as in other languages, they mainly consist of prepositions.","Pewan, as well as the stopword lists can be obtained from (Pewan, 2013). We hope that making these resources publicly available, will bolster further research on Kurdish language."]},{"title":"4 Empirical Study","paragraphs":["In the first part of this section, we first look at the character and word frequencies and try to obtain some insights about the phonological and lexical correlations and discrepancies between Sorani and Kurmanji.","In the second part, we investigate two well-known linguistic laws –Heaps’ and Zipf’s. Although these laws have been observed in many of the Indo-European languages (Lü et al., 2013), the their coefficients depend on language (Gelbukh and Sidorov, 2001) and therefore they can be","5","The relatively small size of the Kurmanji collection is part of a more general trend. In fact, despite having a larger number of speakers, Kurmanji has far fewer online sources with raw text readily available and even those sources do not strictly follow its writing standards. This is partly a result of decades of severe restrictions on use of Kurdish language in Turkey, where the majority of Kurmanji speakers live (Hassanpour et al., 2012).

It should also be noted that in practice, knowing the coefficients of these laws is important in, for example, full-text database design, since it allows predicting some properties of the index as a function of the size of the database. 4.1 Character Frequencies In this experiment we measure the character frequencies, as a phonological property of the language. Figure 2 shows the frequency-ranked lists (from left to right, in decreasing order) of characters of both dialects in the Pewan corpus. Note that for a fairer comparison, we have excluded characters with 1-to-0 and 1-to-2 mappings as well as three characters from the list of 1-to-1 mappings: A, Ê, and Û. The first two have a skewed frequency due to their role as Izafe construction6","marker. The third one is mapped to a double-character ( ) in the Sorani alphabet.","Overall, the relative positions of the equivalent characters in these two lists are comparable (Figure 2). However, there are two notable discrepancies which further exhibit the intrinsic phonological differences between Sorani and Kurmanji:","• use of the character J is far more common in Kurmanji (e.g., in prepositions such as ji “from” and jı̂ “too”),","• same holds for the character V; this is, how-","6","Izafe construction is a shared feature of several Western Iranian languages (Samvelian, 2006).

This figure also contains the links between the words that are transliteration-equivalent and again shows a high level of correlation between the two dialects. A thorough examination of the longer version of the frequent terms’ lists, not only further confirms this correlation but also reveals some other notable patterns:","• the Sorani generic preposition (“from”) has a very wide range of use; in fact, as shown in Figure 3, it is the semantic equivalent of three common Kurmanji prepositions (li, ji, and di),","• in Sorani, a number of the common prepositions (e.g., “too”) as well as the verb","“to be” are used as suffix,","• in Kurmanji, some of the most common prepositions are paired with a postposition (mostly da, de, and ve) and form circumpositions,","• the Kurmanji’s passive/accusative helper verbs (hatin and dan) are among its most frequently used words. 4.3 Heaps’ Law Heaps’s law (Heaps, 1978) is about the growth of distinct words (a.k.a vocabulary size). More specifically, the number of distinct words in a text is roughly proportional to an exponent of its size: log ni ≈ D + h log i (1) Language log ni h Sorani 1.91 + 0.78 log i 0.78 Kurmanji 2.15 + 0.74 log i 0.74 Persian 2.66 + 0.70 log i 0.70 English 2.68 + 0.69 log i 0.69 Table 2: Heaps’ Linear Regression where ni is the number of distinct words occurring before the running word number i, h is the exponent coefficient (between 0 and 1), and D is a constant. In a logarithmic scale, it is a straight line with about 45◦","angle (Gelbukh and Sidorov, 2001).","We carried out an experiment to measure the growth rate of distinct words for both of the Kurdish dialects as well as the Persian and English languages. In this experiment, the Persian corpus was drawn from the standard Hamshahri Collection (AleAhmad et al., 2009) and The English corpus consisted of the Editorial articles of The Guardian newspaper7","(Guardian, 2013).","As the curves in Figure 4 and the linear regression coefficients in Table 2 show, the growth rate of distinct words in both Sorani and Kurmanji Kurdish are higher than Persian and English. This result demonstrates the morphological complexity of the Kurdish language (Samvelian, 2007; Walther, 2011). One of the driving factors be-hind this complexity, is the wide use of suffixes, most notably as: (i) the Izafe construction marker, (ii) the plural noun marker, and (iii) the indefinite marker.","Another important observation from this experiment is that Sorani has a higher growth rate compared to Kurmanji (h = 0.78 vs. h = 0.74). 7","Since they are written by native speakers, cover a wide spectrum of topics between 2006 and 2013, and have clean HTML sources. 303 Figure 5: Zipf’s Laws for Sorani and Kurmanji Kurdish, Persian, and English.

In a logarithmic scale, it is a straight line with about 45◦","angle (Gelbukh and Sidorov, 2001).","The results of our experiment–plotted curves in Figure 5 and linear regression coefficients in Table 3– show that: (i) the distribution of the top most frequent words in Sorani is uniquely differ-ent; it first shows a sharper drop in the top 10 words and then a slower drop for the words ranked between 10 and 100, and (ii) in the remaining parts of the curves, both Kurmanji and Sorani behave similarly; this is also reflected in their values of coefficientz (1.33 and 1.31)."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper we took the first steps towards addressing the two main challenges in Kurdish language processing, namely, resource scarcity and diversity. We presented Pewan, a text corpus for Sorani and Kurmanji, the two principal dialects of the Kurdish language. We also highlighted a range of differences between these two dialects and their writing systems.","The main findings of our analysis can be summarized as follows: (i) there are phonological differences between Sorani and Kurmanji; while some phonemes are non-existent in Kurmanji, some others are less-common in Sorani, (ii) they differ considerably in their vocabulary growth rates, (iii) Sorani has a peculiar frequency distribution w.r.t. its highly-common words. Some of the discrepancies are due to the existence of a generic preposition ( ) in Sorani, as well as the general tendency in its writing system and style to use prepositions as suffix.","Our project at UoK is a work in progress. Recently, we have used the Pewan corpus to build a test collection to evaluate Kurdish Information Retrieval systems (Esmaili et al., 2013). In future, we plan to first develop stemming algorithms for both Sorani and Kurmanji and then leverage those algorithms to examine the lexical differences between the two dialects. Another avenue for future work is to build a transliteration/translation engine between Sorani and Kurmanji."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments that helped us improve the quality of the paper."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Abolfazl AleAhmad, Hadi Amiri, Ehsan Darrudi, Masoud Rahgozar, and Farhad Oroumchian. 2009.
