However, only a small amount of annotated data is available for training quality assessment systems. Wikipedia contains a large amount of texts annotated with cleanup templates which identify quality flaws. We show that the distribution of these labels is topically biased, since they cannot be applied freely to any arbitrary article. We argue that it is necessary to consider the topical restrictions of each label in order to avoid a sampling bias that results in a skewed classifier and overly optimistic evaluation results. We factor out the topic bias by extracting reliable training instances from the revision history which have a topic distribution similar to the labeled articles. This approach better reflects the situation a classifier would face in a real-life application."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["User generated content is the main driving force of the increasingly social web. Blogs, wikis and forums make up a large amount of the daily information consumed by web users. The main properties of user generated content are a low publication threshold and little or no editorial control, which leads to a high variance in quality. In order to navigate through large repositories of information efficiently and safely, users need a way to quickly as-sess the quality of the content. Automatic quality assessment has therefore become a key application in today’s information society. However, there is a lack of training data annotated with fine-grained quality information.","Wikipedia, the largest encyclopedia on the web, contains so-called cleanup templates, which constitute a sophisticated system of user generated labels that mark quality problems in articles. Recently, these cleanup templates have been used for automatically identifying articles with particular quality flaws in order to support Wikipedia’s quality assurance process in Wikipedia. In a shared task (Anderka and Stein, 2012b), several systems have shown that it is possible to identify the ten most frequent quality flaws with high recall and fair precision.","However, quality flaw detection based on cleanup template recognition suffers from a topic bias that is well known from other text classification applications such as authorship attribution or genre identification. We discovered that cleanup templates have implicit topical restrictions, i.e. they cannot be applied to any arbitrary article. As a consequence, corpora of flawed articles based on these templates are biased towards particular topics. We argue that it is therefore not sufficient for evaluating a quality flaw prediction systems to measure how well they can separate (topically restricted) flawed articles from a set of random outliers. It is rather necessary to determine reliable negative instances with a similar topic distribution as the set of positive instances in order to factor out the sampling bias. Related studies (Brooke and Hirst, 2011) have proven that topic bias is a confounding factor that results in misleading cross-validated performance while allowing only near chance performance in practical applications.","We present an approach for factoring out the bias from quality flaw corpora by mining reliable negative instances for each flaw from the article revision history. Furthermore, we employ the article revision history to extract reliable positive training instances by using the version of each article at the time it has first been identified as flawed. This way, we avoid including articles with outdated cleanup templates, a frequent phe-721 nomenon that can occur when a template is not removed after fixing a problem in an article. In our experiments, we focus on neutrality and style flaws, since they are of particular high importance within the Wikipedia community (Stvilia et al., 2008; Ferschke et al., 2012a) and are recognized beyond Wikipedia in applications such as uncertainty recognition (Szarvas et al., 2012) and hedge detection (Farkas et al., 2010)."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Topic bias is a known problem in text classification. Mikros and Argiri (2007) investigate the topic influence in authorship attribution. They found that even simple stylometric features, such as sentence and token length, readability measures or word length distributions show consider-able correlations with topic. They argue that many features that were largely considered to be topic neutral are in fact topic-dependent variables. Consequently, results obtained on multitopic corpora are prone to be biased by the correlation of authors with specific topics. Therefore, several authors in-troduce topic-controlled corpora for applications such as author identification (Koppel and Schler, 2003; Luyckx and Daelemans, 2005) or genre detection (Finn and Kushmerick, 2006).","Brooke and Hirst (2011) measure the topic bias in the International Corpus of Learner English and found that it causes a substantial skew in classifiers for native language detection. In accordance with Mikros et al., the authors found that even non-lexicalized meta features, such as vocabulary size or length statistics, depend on topics and cause cross-validated performance evalua-tions to be unrealistically high. In a practical setting, these biased classifiers hardly exceed chance performance.","As already noted above, a similar kind of topic bias negatively influences quality flaw detection in Wikipedia. Anderka et al. (2012) automatically identify quality flaws by predicting the cleanup templates in unseen articles with a one-class classification approach. Based on this work, a competition on quality flaw prediction has been established (Anderka and Stein, 2012b). The winning team of the inaugural edition of the task was able to detect the ten most common quality flaws with an average F1-Score of 0.81 using a PU learning approach (Ferretti et al., 2012). With a binary classification approach, Ferschke et al. (2012b) achieved an average F1-Score of 0.80, while reaching a higher precision than the winning team.","A closer examination of the aforementioned quality flaw detection systems reveals a systematic sampling bias in the training data, which leads to an overly optimistic performance evaluation and classifiers that are biased towards particular article topics. Our approach factors out the topic bias from the training data by mining topically controlled training instances from the Wikipedia revision history. The results show that flaw detection is a much harder problem in a real-life scenario."]},{"title":"3 Quality Flaws and Flaw Recognition in Wikipedia","paragraphs":["Quality standards in Wikipedia are mainly defined by the featured article criteria1","and the Wikipedia Manual of Style2",". These policies define the characteristics excellent articles have to exhibit. Other sets of quality criteria are adaptations or relaxations of these standards, such as the good article criteria or the quality grading schemes of individual interest groups in Wikipedia.","In this work, we focus on quality flaws regarding neutrality and style problems. We chose these categories due to their high importance within the Wikipedia community (Stvilia et al., 2008; Ferschke et al., 2012a) and due to their relevance to content outside of Wikipedia, such as blogs or on-line news articles. According to the Wikipedia policies3",", an article has to be written from a neutral point of view. Thus, authors must avoid stat-ing opinions and seriously contested assertions as facts, avoid presenting uncontested factual assertions as mere opinions, prefer nonjudgmental language and indicate the relative prominence of opposing views. Furthermore, authors have to adhere to the stylistic guidelines defined in the Manual of Style. While this subsumes a broad range of is-sues such as formatting and article structure, we focus on the style of writing and disregard mere structural properties.","Any articles that violate these criteria can be marked with cleanup templates4","to indicate their need for improvement.

Table 1: Neutrality and style flaw corpora used in this work Template Clusters Since several cleanup templates might represent different manifestations of the same quality flaw, there is a 1 to n relationship between quality flaws and cleanup templates. For instance, the templates pov-check5",", pov6","and npov language7","can all be mapped to the same flaw concerning the neutral point of view of an article. This aggregation of cleanup templates into flaw-clusters is a subjective task. It is not always clear whether a particular template refers to an existing flaw or should be regarded as a separate class. Too many clusters will cause definition overlaps (i.e. similar cleanup templates are assigned to different clusters), while too few clusters will result in unclear flaw definitions, since each flaw receives a wide range of possible manifestations. Template Scope Another important aspect to be considered is the difference in the scope which cleanup templates can have. Inline-templates are placed directly in the text and refer to the sentence or paragraph they are placed in. Templates with a section parameter, refer to the section they are placed in. The majority of templates, however, refer to a whole page. The consideration of the template scope is of particular importance for quality flaw recognition problems. For example, the presence of a cleanup template which marks a single section as not notable does not entail that the whole article is not notable.","5","The article has been nominated for a neutrality check","6","The neutrality of the article is disputed","7","The article contains a non-neutral style of writing Topical Restriction A final aspect that has not been taken into account by related work is that many cleanup templates have restrictions concerning the pages they may be applied to. A hard restriction is the page type (or namespace) a template might be used in. For example, some templates can only be used in articles while others can only be applied to discussion pages. This is usually enforced by maintenance scripts running on the Wikimedia servers. A soft restriction, on the other hand, are the topics of the articles a template can be used in. Many cleanup templates can only be applied to articles from certain subject areas. An example with a particularly obvious restriction is the template in-universe (see Table 1), which should only be applied to articles about fiction. This topical restriction is neither explicitly defined nor automatically enforced, but it plays an important role in the quality flaw recognition task, as the remainder of this paper will show. While flaws merely concerning the structural or linguistic properties of an article are less restricted to individual topics, they are still affected by a certain degree of topical preference. Many subject areas in Wikipedia are organized in WikiProjects8",", which have their own ways of reviewing and ensuring quality within their topical scope. Depend-ing on the quality assurance processes established in a WikiProject, different importance is given to individual types of flaws. Thus, the distribution of cleanup templates regarding structural or grammatical flaws is also biased towards certain topics. 8 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:PROJ 723 We will henceforth subsume the concept of topical preference under the term topical restriction. Quality Flaw Recognition Based on the above definition of quality flaws, we define the quality flaw recognition task similar to Anderka et al. (2012) as follows: Given a sample of articles in which each article has been tagged with any cleanup template τi from a specific template cluster T f thus marking all articles in the sample with a quality flaw f , it has to be decided whether or not an unseen article suffers from f ."]},{"title":"4 Data Selection and Corpus Creation","paragraphs":["For creating our corpora, we start with selecting all cleanup templates listed under the categories neutrality and style in the typology of cleanup templates provided by Anderka and Stein (2012a). Each of the selected templates serves as the nucleus of a template cluster that potentially represents a quality flaw. To each cluster, we add all templates that are synonymous to the nucleus. The synonyms are listed in the template description under redirects or shortcuts. Then we iteratively add all synonyms of the newly added template until no more redirects can be found. Furthermore, we manually inspect the lists of similar templates in the see also sections of the template descrip-tions and include all templates that refer to the same concept as the other templates in the cluster. As mentioned earlier, this is a subjective task and largely depends on the desired granularity of the flaw definitions. We finally merge semantically similar template clusters to avoid too fine grained flaw distinctions.","As a result, we obtain a total number of 94 template clusters representing 60 style flaws and 34 neutrality flaws. From each of these clusters, we remove templates with inline or section scope due to the reasons outlined in Section 3. We also remove all templates that are restricted to pages other than articles (e.g. discussion or user pages).","We use the Java Wikipedia Library (Zesch et al., 2008) to extract all articles marked with the selected templates. We only regard flaws with at least 500 affected articles in the snapshot of the English Wikipedia from January 4, 2012. Table 1 lists the final sets of flaws used in this work.

Agreement with Human Rater Quality flaw detection in Wikipedia is based on the assuption that cleanup templates are valid markers of quality flaws. In order to test the reliabil-ity of these user assigned templates as quality flaw markers, we carried out an annotation study in which a human annotator was asked to perform the binary flaw detection task manually. Even though the human performance does not necessarily provide an upper boundary for the automatic classification task, it gives insights into potentially problematic cases and ill-defined annotations. The annotator was provided with the template definitions from the respective template information page as instructions. For each of the 12 article scope flaws, we extracted the plain text of 10 random flawed articles and 10 random untagged articles. The annotator had to decide for each flaw individually whether a given text belonged to a flawed article or not. She was not informed about the ratio of flawed to untagged articles.","Table 2 lists the chance corrected agreement (Cohen’s κ) along with the F1 performance of the human annotations against the gold standard corpus. The templates copy-edit and trivia yielded the lowest performance in the study. Even though copy-edit templates are assigned to whole articles, they refer to grammatical and stylistic problems of relatively small portions of the text. This increases the risk of overlooking a problematic span of text, especially in longer articles. The trivia template, on the other hand, designates sections that contain miscellaneous information that are not well integrated in the article. Upon manual inspection, we found a wide range of possible manifestations of 724 this flaw ranging from an agglomeration of incoherent factoids to well-structured sections that did not exactly match the focus of the article, which is the main reason for the low agreement."]},{"title":"5 Selection of Reliable Training Instances","paragraphs":["Independent from the classification approach used to identify flawed articles, reliable training data is the most important prerequisite for good predic-tions. On the one hand, we need a set of examples that reliably represent a particular flaw, while on the other hand, we need counterexamples which reliably represent articles that do not suffer from the same flaw. The latter aspect is most important for discriminative classification approaches, since they rely on negative instances for training the classifier. However, reliable negative instances are also important for one-class classification approaches, since it is only for the counterexamples (or outliers) that the performance of one-class classifiers can be sufficiently evaluated. It is furthermore important that the positive and the negative instances do not differ systematically in any respect other than the presence or absence of the respective flaws, since any systematic di fference will bias the classifier. In this context, the topical restrictions of cleanup templates have to be taken into account. In the following, we describe our approach to extracting reliable training instances from the quality flaw corpora. 5.1 Reliable Positives In previous work, the latest available versions of flawed articles have been used as positive training instances. However, we found upon manual in-spection of the data that a substantial number of articles has been significantly edited between the time tτ, at which the template was first assigned, and the time te, at which the articles have been extracted. Using the latest version at time te can thus include articles in which the respective flaw has already been fixed without removing the cleanup template. Therefore, we use the revision of the article at time tτ to assure that the flaw is still present in the training instance.","We use the Wikipedia Revision Toolkit (Ferschke et al., 2011), an enhancement of the Java Wikipedia Library, to gain access to the revision history of each article. For every article in the corpus of positive examples for flaw f that is marked with template τ ∈ T f , we backtrack the revision history chronologically, until we find the first revision rtτ−1 that is not tagged with τ . We then add the succeeding revision rtτ to the corpus of reliable positives for flaw f . In Section 6, we show that the classification performance improves for most flaws when using reliable positives instead of the latest available article versions.","5.2 Reliable Negatives and Topical Restriction A central problem of the quality flaw recognition approach is the fact that there are no articles available that are tagged to not contain a particular quality problem. So far, two solutions to this issue have been proposed in related work. Anderka et al. (2012) tackle the problem with a one-class classifier that is trained on the positive instances alone thus eradicating the need for negative instances in the training phase. However, in order to evaluate the classifier, a set of outliers is needed. The authors circumvent this issue by evaluating their classifiers on a set of random untagged instances and a set of featured articles and argue that the actual performance of predicting the quality flaws lies between the two.","Ferretti et al. (2012) follow a two step classification approach (PU learning) that first uses a Naive Bayes classifier trained on positive instances and random untagged articles to pre-classify the data. In a second phase, they use the negatives identified by the Naive Bayes classifier to train a Support Vector Machine that produces the final predic-tions. Even though the Naive Bayes classifier was supposed to identify reliable negatives, the authors found no significant improvement over a random selection of negative instances, which effectively renders the PU learning approach redundant.","None of the above approaches consider the issue of topical restriction mentioned in Section 3, which introduces a systematic bias to the data. Both approaches sample random negative instances Arnd for any given set of flawed articles A f from a set of untagged articles Au (see Fig. 1a). In order to factor out the article topics as a major characteristic for distinguishing flawed articles from the set of outliers, reliable negative instances Arel have to be sampled from the restricted topic set Atopic that contains articles with a topic distribution similar to the flawed articles in A f (see Fig. 1b). This will avoid the systematic bias and 725 (a) Random negatives (b) Reliable negatives Figure 1: Sampling of negative instances for a given set of flawed articles ( A f ). Random negatives (Arnd) are sampled from articles without any cleanup templates (Au). Reliable negatives (Arel) are sampled from the set of articles (Atopic) with the same topic distribution as A f result in a more realistic performance evaluation.","In the following, we present our approach to extracting reliable negative training instances that conform with the topical restrictions of the cleanup templates. Without loss of generality, we assume that an article, from which a cleanup template τ ∈ T f is deleted at a point in time dτ, the article no longer suffers from flaw f at that point in time. Thus, the revision rdτ is a reliable negative instance for the flaw f . Additionally, since the article was once tagged with τ ∈ T f , it belongs to the the same restricted topic set Atopic as the positive instances for flaw f .","We use the Apache Hadoop9","framework and WikiHadoop10",", an input format for Wikipedia XML dumps, for crawling the whole revision history of the English Wikipedia on a compute cluster. WikiHadoop allows each Hadoop mapper to receive adjacent revision pairs, which makes it possible to compare the changes made from one revision to the next. For every template τ ∈ T f , we extract all adjacent revision pairs (rdτ−1, rdτ), in which the first revision containsτ and the second does not contain τ. Since there are occasions in which a template is replaced by another template from the same cluster, we ensure that rdτ does also not contain any other template from cluster T f before we finally add the revision to the set of reliable negatives for flaw f .","In the remainder of this section, we evaluate the topical similarity between the positive and the negative set of articles for each flaw using both our method and the original approach. In Wikipedia, 9 http://hadoop.apache.org 10 https://github.com/whym/wikihadoop the topic of an article is captured by the categories assigned to it. In order to compare two sets of articles with respect to their topical similarity, we represent each article set as a category frequency vector. Formally, we calculate for each set the vector ⃗C = (wc","1, wc2, . . . , wcn) with wci being the weight of category ci, i.e. the number of times it occurs in the set, and n being the total number of categories in Wikipedia. We can then estimate the topical similarity of two article sets by calculating the cosine similarity of their category frequency vectors ⃗C1 A and ⃗C2 B as sim(A, B) = A · B ∥A∥ ∥B∥ = n∑ i=1 Ai × Bi √ n∑ i=1","(Ai)2 × √ n∑ i=1 (Bi)2","Table 3 gives an overview of the similarity scores between each positive training set and the corresponding reliable negative set as well as between each positive set and a random set of untagged articles. We can see that the topics of articles in the positive training sets are highly similar to the topics of the corresponding reliable negative articles while they show little similarity to the articles in the random set. This implies that the systematic bias introduced by the topical restriction has largely been eradicated by our approach.","Individual flaws have di fferently strong topical restrictions. The strength of this restriction depends on the size of Atopic. That is, a flaw such as in-universe is restricted to a very narrow selection of articles, while a flaw such as copy edit can be applied to most articles and rather shows a topical preference due to reasons outlined in Section 3.

Our system for quality flaw detection follows the approach by Ferschke et al. (2012b), since it has been particularly designed as a modular system based on the Unstructured Information Management Architecture11",", which makes it easy to extend. Instead of using Mallet (McCallum, 2002) as a machine learning toolkit, we employ the Weka Data Mining Software (Hall et al., 2009) for classification, since it offers a wider range of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. For each of the 12 quality flaws, we employ three di fferent dataset configurations. The BASE configuration uses the newest version of each flawed article as positive instances and a random set of untagged articles as negative instances. The RELP configuration uses reliable positives, as described in Section 5.1, in combination with random outliers. Finally, the RELALL configuration employs reliable positives in combination with the respective reliable negatives as described in Section 5.2.

First, we filter the ngrams according to their document frequency in the training corpus. We discard all ngrams that occur in less than x% and more than y% of all documents. Several values for x and y have been evaluated in parameter tuning experiments. The best results have been achieved with x=2 and y=90. In a second step, we apply the Information Gain feature selection approach (Mitchell, 1997) to the remaining set to determine the most useful features.

One class classifiers are trained on the positive instances alone. We determined the best parameters for each algorithms in a parameter optimization run and list the results of the best configuration.","Overall, Support Vector Machines with RBF kernels yielded the best average results and out-performed the other algorithms on every flaw. We used a sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm (Platt, 1998) to train the SVMs and used different γ-values for the RBF kernel function. In contrast to Ferretti et al. (2012), we did not see significant improvements when optimizingγ for each individual flaw, so we determined one best setting for each dataset. Since SVMs with RBF kernels are a special case of RBF networks that fit a single basis function to the data, we also used general RBF networks that can employ multiple basis functions, but we did not achieve better results with that approach.","One-class classification, as proposed by Anderka et al.

However, the performance still lacks behind the other approaches in our experiments. The best perform-ing algorithm reported by Ferschke et al. (2012b), AdaBoost with decision stumps as a weak learner, showed the second best results in our experiments."]},{"title":"7 Evaluation and Discussion","paragraphs":["The SVMs achieve a similar cross-validated performance on all feature sets containing ngrams, showing only minor improvements for individual flaws when adding non-lexical features. This suggests that the classifiers largely depend on the ngrams and that other features do not contribute significantly to the classification performance. While structural quality flaws can be well captured by special purpose features or in-tensional modeling, as related work has shown, more subtle content flaws such as the neutrality and style flaws are mainly captured by the wording itself. Textual features beyond the ngram level, such as syntactic and semantic qualities of the text, could further improve the classification performance of these flaws and should be addressed in future work. Table 6 shows the performance of the SVMs with RBF kernel12","on each dataset using the NGRAM feature set. The average performance based on NOWIKI is slightly lower while using ALL features results in slightly higher average F1-scores. However, the differences are not statistically significant and thus omitted. Classifiers using theNONGRAM feature set achieved average F1-scores below 0.50 on all datasets. The results have been obtained by 10-fold cross validation on 2,000 documents per flaw.","The classifiers trained on reliable positives and random untagged articles (RELP) outperform the respective classifiers based on the BASE dataset for most flaws. This confirms our original hypothesis that using the appropriate revision of each tagged article is superior to using the latest available version from the dump. The performance on the RELALL dataset, in which the topic bias has been factored out, yields lower F1-scores than the two other approaches. Flaws that are restricted to a very narrow set of topics (i.e. Atopic in Fig. 1b is small), such as the in-universe flaw, show the biggest drop in performance. Since the topic bias plays a major role in the quality flaw detection task, as we have shown earlier, the topic-controlled classifier cannot take advantage of the topic information, while the classifiers trained on the other corpora can make use of these characteristic as the most discriminative features. In the RELALL setting, however, the differences between the positive and negative instances are largely determined by the flaws alone. Classifiers trained on","12","γ=0.01 for BASE,RELP and γ=0.001 for RELALL 728 such a dataset therefore come closer to recogniz-ing the actual quality flaws, which makes them more useful in a practical setting despite lower cross-validated scores.","In addition to cross-validation, we performed a cross-corpus evaluation of the classifiers for each flaw. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of the unbiased classifiers (trained on RELALL) on the biased data (RELP) and vice versa. Hereby, the positive training and test instances remain the same in both settings, while the unbiased data contains negative instances sampled from Arel and the unbiased data from Arnd (see Figure 1). With the NGRAM feature set, the reliable classifiers outperformed the unreliable classifiers on all flaws that can be well identified with lexical cues, such as Advert or Technical. In the biased case, we found both topic related and flaw specific ngrams among the most highly ranked ngram features. In the unbiased case, most of the informative ngrams were flaw specific expressions. Consequently, biased classifiers fail on the unbiased dataset in which the positive and negative class are sampled from the same topics, which renders the highly ranked topic ngrams unusable. Flaws that do not largely rely on lexical cues, however, cannot be predicted more reliably with the unbiased classifier. This means that additional features are needed to describe these flaw. We tested this hypothesis by using the full feature set ALL and saw a substantial improvement on the side of the unbiased classifier, while the performance of the biased classifier remained unchanged.","A direct comparison of our results to related work is difficult, since neutrality and style flaws have not been targeted before in a similar manner. However, the Advert flaw was also part of the ten flaw types in the PAN Quality Flaw Recognition Task (Anderka and Stein, 2012b).

Unbiased corpora are not only necessary for training unbiased classifiers, they are also invaluable resources for gaining a deeper understanding of the linguistic properties of the flaws. Unbiased classifiers reflect much better the performance of quality flaw recognition “in the wild”, because they detect actual flawed articles rather than identifying the articles that are prone to certain quality due to their topic or subject matter. In our experiments, we presented a system for identifying Wikipedia articles with style and neutrality flaws, a novel category of quality problems that is of particular importance within and outside of Wikipedia. We showed that selecting a reliable set of positive training instances mined from the revision history improves the classification performance. In future work, we aim to extend our quality flaw detection system to not only find articles that contain a particular flaw, but also to identify the flaws within the articles, which can be achieved by leveraging the positional information of in-line cleanup templates."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work has been supported by the Volkswagen Foundation as part of the Lichtenberg-Professorship Program under grant No. I/82806, and by the Hessian research excellence program “Landes-O ffensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlich- Ökonomischer Exzellenz” (LOEWE) as part of the research center ”Digital Humanities”. 729"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Maik Anderka and Benno Stein. 2012a.
