The toolkit focuses in particular on compositional meaning, and implements a number of composition methods that have been proposed in the literature. Furthermore, DISSECT can be use-ful to researchers and practitioners who need models of word meaning (without composition) as well, as it supports various methods to construct distributional semantic spaces, assessing similarity and even evaluating against benchmarks, that are independent of the composition infrastructure."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Distributional methods for meaning similarity are based on the observation that similar words occur in similar contexts and measure similarity based on patterns of word occurrence in large corpora (Clark, 2012; Erk, 2012; Turney and Pantel, 2010). More precisely, they represent words, or any other target linguistic elements, as highdimensional vectors, where the dimensions represent context features. Semantic relatedness is as-sessed by comparing vectors, leading, for example, to determine that car and vehicle are very similar in meaning, since they have similar contextual distributions. Despite the appeal of these methods, modeling words in isolation has limited applications and ideally we want to model semantics beyond word level by representing the meaning of phrases or sentences. These combinations are in-finite and compositional methods are called for to derive the meaning of a larger construction from the meaning of its parts. For this reason, the ques-tion of compositionality within the distributional paradigm has received a lot of attention in recent years and a number of compositional frameworks have been proposed in the distributional semantic literature, see, e.g., Coecke et al. (2010) and Mitchell and Lapata (2010). For example, in such frameworks, the distributional representations of red and car may be combined, through various operations, in order to obtain a vector for red car.","The DISSECT toolkit (http://clic. cimec.unitn.it/composes/toolkit) is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide an easy-to-use implementation of many compositional methods proposed in the literature. As such, we hope that it will foster further work on compositional distributional semantics, as well as making the relevant techniques easily available to those interested in their many potential applica-tions, e.g., to context-based polysemy resolution, recognizing textual entailment or paraphrase detection. Moreover, the DISSECT tools to construct distributional semantic spaces from raw co-occurrence counts, to measure similarity and to evaluate these spaces might also be of use to researchers who are not interested in the compositional framework. DISSECT is freely available under the GNU General Public License."]},{"title":"2 Building and composing distributional semantic representations","paragraphs":["The pipeline from corpora to compositional models of meaning can be roughly summarized as consisting of three stages:1 1. Extraction of co-occurrence counts from corpora In this stage, an input corpus is used to extract counts of target elements co-occurring with some contextual features. The target elements can vary from words (for lexical similarity), to pairs of words (e.g., for relation categorization), 1 See Turney and Pantel (2010) for a technical overview of","distributional methods for semantics. 31 to paths in syntactic trees (for unsupervised paraphrasing). Context features can also vary from shallow window-based collocates to syntactic dependencies. 2. Transformation of the raw counts This stage may involve the application of weighting schemes such as Pointwise Mutual Information, feature selection, dimensionality reduction methods such as Singular Value Decomposition, etc. The goal is to eliminate the biases that typically affect raw counts and to produce vectors which better approximate similarity in meaning. 3. Application of composition functions Once meaningful representations have been constructed for the atomic target elements of interest (typically, words), various methods, such as vector addition or multiplication, can be used for combining them to derive context-sensitive representations or for constructing representations for larger phrases or even entire sentences. DISSECT can be used for the second and third stages of this pipeline, as well as to measure similarity among the resulting word or phrase vectors. The first step is highly language-, task- and corpus-annotation-dependent. We do not attempt to implement all the corpus pre-processing and co-occurrence extraction routines that it would require to be of general use, and expect instead as input a matrix of raw target-context co-occurrence counts.2","DISSECT provides various methods to re-weight the counts with association measures, dimensionality reduction methods as well as the composition functions proposed by Mitchell and Lapata (2010) (Additive, Multiplicative and Dilation), Baroni and Zamparelli (2010)/Coecke et al. (2010) (Lexfunc) and Guevara (2010)/Zanzotto et al. (2010) (Fulladd). In DISSECT we define and implement these in a unified framework and in a computationally efficient manner. The focus of DISSECT is to provide an intuitive interface for researchers and to allow easy extension by adding other composition methods."]},{"title":"3 DISSECT overview","paragraphs":["DISSECT is written in Python. We provide many standard functionalities through a set of power-","2","These counts can be read from a text file containing two strings (the target and context items) and a number (the corresponding count) on each line (e.g., maggot food 15) or from a matrix in format word freq1 freq2 ... #create a semantic space from counts in #dense format(\"dm\"): word freq1 freq2 .. ss = Space.build(data=\"counts.txt\",","format=\"dm\") #apply transformations ss = ss.apply(PpmiWeighting()) ss = ss.apply(Svd(300)) #retrieve the vector of a target element print ss.get_row(\"car\") Figure 1: Creating a semantic space. ful command-line tools, however users with basic Python familiarity are encouraged to use the Python interface that DISSECT provides. This section focuses on this interface (see the online documentation on how to perform the same operations with the command-line tools), that consists of the following top-level packages: #DISSECT packages composes.matrix composes.semantic_space composes.transformation composes.similarity composes.composition composes.utils Semantic spaces and transformations The concept of a semantic space (composes.semantic space) is at the core of the DISSECT toolkit. A semantic space consists of co-occurrence values, stored as a matrix, together with strings associated to the rows of this matrix (by design, the target linguistic elements) and a (potentially empty) list of strings associated to the columns (the context features). A number of transformations (composes.transformation) can be applied to semantic spaces. We implement weighting schemes such as positive Pointwise Mutual Information (ppmi) and Local Mutual Information, feature selection methods, dimensionality reduction (Singular Value De-composition (SVD) and Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF)), and new methods can be easily added.3","Going from raw counts to a transformed space is accomplished in just a few lines of code (Figure 1).","3","The complete list of transformations currently supported can be found at http://clic.cimec.unitn. it/composes/toolkit/spacetrans.html# spacetrans. 32 #load a previously saved space ss = io_utils.load(\"ss.pkl\") #compute cosine similarity print ss.get_sim(\"car\", \"book\",","CosSimilarity()) #the two nearest neighbours of \"car\" print ss.get_neighbours(\"car\", 2,","CosSimilarity()) Figure 2: Similarity queries in a semantic space.","Furthermore DISSECT allows the possibility of adding new data to a semantic space in an online manner (using the semantic space.peripheral space functionality). This can be used as a way to efficiently expand a co-occurrence matrix with new rows, without re-applying the transformations to the entire space. In some other cases, the user may want to represent phrases that are specialization of words already existing in the space (e.g., slimy maggot and maggot), without distorting the computation of association measures by counting the same context twice. In this case, adding slimy maggot as a “peripheral” row to a semantic space that already contains maggot implements the desired behaviour. Similarity queries Semantic spaces are used for the computation of similarity scores. DISSECT provides a series of similarity measures such as cosine, inverse Euclidean distance and Lin similarity, implemented in the composes.similarity package. Similarity of two elements can be computed within one semantic space or across two spaces that have the same dimensionality. Figure 2 exemplifies (word) similarity computations with DISSECT. Composition functions Composition functions in DISSECT (composes.composition) take as arguments a list of element pairs to be composed, and one or two spaces where the elements to be composed are represented. They return a semantic space containing the distributional representations of the composed items, which can be further transformed, used for similarity queries, or used as inputs to another round of composition, thus scaling up beyond binary composition. Figure 3 shows a Multiplicative composition example. See Table 1 for the currently available composition models, their definitions and parameters.

Note that in Lexfunc each functor word corresponds to a separate matrix or tensor Au (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010). Parameter estimation All composition models except Multiplicative have parameters to be estimated. For simple models with few parameters, such as as Additive, the parameters can be passed by hand. However, DISSECT supports automated parameter estimation from training examples. In particular, we extend to all composition methods the idea originally proposed by Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) for Lexfunc and Guevara (2010) for Fulladd, namely to use corpus-extracted example vectors of both the input (typically, words) and output elements (typically, phrases) in order to optimize the composition operation parameters. The problem can be generally stated as:","θ∗ = arg min","θ ||P − f compθ(U, V )||F where U, V and P are matrices containing input and output vectors respectively. For example U may contain adjective vectors such as red, blue, V noun vectors such as car, sky and P corpus-extracted vectors for the corresponding phrases red car, blue sky. f compθ is a composition function and θ stands for a list of parameters that this composition function is associated with.4","We implement standard least-squares estimation methods as well as Ridge regression with the option for generalized cross-validation, but other methods such as partial least-squares regression can be easily added. Figure 4 exemplifies the Fulladd model. Composition output examples DISSECT provides functions to evaluate (compositional) distributional semantic spaces against benchmarks in the composes.utils package. However, as a more qualitatively interesting example of what can be done with DISSECT, Table 2 shows the nearest","4","Details on the extended corpus-extracted vector estimation method in DISSECT can be found in Dinu et al.

On the other hand, dimensionality reduction operations, which are often used in distributional models, lead to smaller, dense structures, for which sparse representations are not optimal. This is our motiva-tion for supporting both dense and sparse representations. The choice of dense vs. sparse is initially determined by the input format, if a space is created from co-occurrence counts. By default, DISSECT switches to dense representations after dimensionality reduction, however the user can freely switch from one representation to the other, in order to optimize computations. For this purpose DISSECT provides wrappers around matrix operations, as well as around common linear algebra operations, in the composes.matrix package. The underlying Python functionality is provided by numpy.array and scipy.sparse. Efficient computations DISSECT is optimized for speed since most operations are cast as matrix operations, that are very efficiently implemented in Python’s numpy and scipy modules5",". Tables 4 and 5 show running times for typical DISSECT operations: application of the ppmi weighting scheme, nearest neighbour queries and estimation of composition function parameters (on a 2.1","5","For SVD on sparse structures, we use sparsesvd (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sparsesvd/).

GHz machine). The price to pay for fast computations is that data must be stored in main memory. We do not think that this is a major inconvenience. For example, a typical symmetric co-occurrence matrix extracted from a corpus of several billion words, defining context in terms of 5-word windows and considering the top 100K×100K most frequent words, contains ≈ 250 million entries and requires only 2GB of memory for (double precision) storage. Simple design We have opted for a very simple and intuitive design as the classes interact in very natural ways: A semantic space stores the actual data matrix and structures to index its rows and columns, and supports similarity queries and transformations. Transformations take one semantic space as input to return another, transformed, space. Composition functions take one or more input spaces and yield a composed-elements space, which can further undergo transformations and be used for similarity queries. In fact, DISSECT semantic spaces also support higher-order tensor representations, not just vectors. Higher-order representations are used, for example, to represent transitive verbs and other multi-argument functors by Coecke et al. (2010) and Grefenstette et al. (2013). See http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/ composes/toolkit/composing.html for an example of using DISSECT for estimating such tensors. Extensive documentation The DISSECT documentation can be found at http://clic. cimec.unitn.it/composes/toolkit. We provide a tutorial which guides the user through the creation of some toy semantic spaces, estimation of the parameters of composition models and similarity computations in semantic spaces. We also provide a full-scale example of intransitive verb-subject composition. We show how to go from co-occurrence counts to composed representations and make the data used in the examples available for download. Comparison to existing software In terms of design choices, DISSECT most resembles the Gensim toolkit ( Řehůřek and Sojka, 2010). However Gensim is intended for topic modeling, and therefore diverges considerably from DISSECT in its functionality. The SSpace package of Jurgens and Stevens (2010) also overlaps to some degree with DISSECT in terms of its intended use, however, like Gensim, it does not support compositional operations that, as far as we know, are an unique feature of DISSECT."]},{"title":"5 Future extensions","paragraphs":["We implemented and are currently testing DISSECT functions supporting other composition methods, including the one proposed by Socher et al. (2012). Adding further methods is our top-priority goal. In particular, several distributional models of word meaning in context share important similarities with composition models, and we plan to add them to DISSECT. Dinu et al. (2012) show, for example, that well-performing, simplified variants of the method in Thater et al. (2010), Thater et al. (2011) and Erk and Padó (2008) can be reduced to relatively simple matrix operations, making them particularly suitable for a DISSECT implementation. 35","DISSECT is currently optimized for the composition of many phrases of the same type. This is in line with most of the current evaluations of compositional models, which focus on specific phenomena, such as adjectival modification, noun-noun compounds or intransitive verbs, to name a few. In the future we plan to provide a module for composing entire sentences, taking syntactic trees as input and returning composed representations for each node in the input trees.","Finally, we intend to make use of the existing Python plotting libraries to add a visualization module to DISSECT."]},{"title":"6 Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank Angeliki Lazaridou for helpful discussions.
