While many of these tasks, such as parsing, perform the best over fully grammatically correct text, most existing text normalization approaches narrowly define the task in theword-to-word sense; that is, the task is seen as that of mapping all out-of-vocabulary non-standard words to their in-vocabulary standard forms. In this paper, we take a parser-centric view of normalization that aims to convert raw informal text into grammatically correct text. To understand the real effect of normalization on the parser, we tie normalization performance directly to parser performance. Additionally, we design a customizable framework to address the often overlooked concept of domain adaptability, and illustrate that the system allows for transfer to new domains with a minimal amount of data and effort. Our experimental study over datasets from three domains demonstrates that our approach outper-forms not only the state-of-the-art word-to-word normalization techniques, but also manual word-to-word annotations."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Text normalization is the task of transforming informal writing into its standard form in the language. It is an important processing step for a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as text-to-speech synthesis, speech recognition, information extraction, parsing, and machine translation (Sproat et al., 2001). ∗ This work was conducted at IBM.","The use of normalization in these applications poses multiple challenges. First, as it is most often conceptualized, normalization is seen as the task of mapping all out-of-vocabulary non-standard word tokens to their in-vocabulary standard forms. However, the scope of the task can also be seen as much wider, encompassing whatever actions are required to convert the raw text into a fully grammatical sentence. This broader definition of the normalization task may include modifying punctuation and capitalization, and adding, removing, or reordering words. Second, as with other NLP techniques, normalization approaches are often focused on one primary domain of interest (e.g., Twitter data). Because the style of informal writing may be different in different data sources, tailoring an approach towards a particular data source can improve performance in the desired domain. However, this is often done at the cost of adaptability.","This work introduces a customizable normalization approach designed with domain transfer in mind. In short, customization is done by provid-ing the normalizer with replacement generators, which we define in Section 3. We show that the introduction of a small set of domain-specific generators and training data allows our model to outperform a set of competitive baselines, including state-of-the-art word-to-word normalization. Additionally, the flexibility of the model also allows it to attempt to produce fully grammatical sentences, something not typically handled by word-to-word normalization approaches.","Another potential problem with state-of-the-art normalization is the lack of appropriate evaluation metrics. The normalization task is most frequently motivated by pointing to the need for clean text for downstream processing applications, such as syntactic parsing. However, most studies of normalization give little insight into whether and to what degree the normalization process improves 1159 the performance of the downstream application. For instance, it is unclear how performance measured by the typical normalization evaluation metrics of word error rate and BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) translates into performance on a parsing task, where a well placed punctuation mark may provide more substantial improvements than changing a non-standard word form. To address this problem, this work introduces an evaluation metric that ties normalization performance directly to the performance of a downstream dependency parser.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss previous approaches to the normalization problem. Section 3 presents our normalization framework, including the actual normalization and learning procedures. Our instantiation of this model is presented in Section 4. In Section 5 we introduce the parser driven evaluation metric, and present experimental results of our model with respect to several baselines in three different domains. Finally, we discuss our experimental study in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Sproat et al. (2001) took the first major look at the normalization problem, citing the need for normalized text for downstream applications. Unlike later works that would primarily focus on specific noisy data sets, their work is notable for attempt-ing to develop normalization as a general process that could be applied to different domains. The recent rise of heavily informal writing styles such as Twitter and SMS messages set off a new round of interest in the normalization problem.","Research on SMS and Twitter normalization has been roughly categorized as drawing inspiration from three other areas of NLP (Kobus et al., 2008): machine translation, spell checking, and automatic speech recognition. The statistical machine translation (SMT) metaphor was the first proposed to handle the text normalization problem (Aw et al., 2006). In this mindset, normalizing SMS can be seen as a translation task from a source language (informal) to a target language (formal), which can be undertaken with typical noisy channel based models. Work by Choudhury et al. (2007) adopted the spell checking metaphor, casting the problem in terms of character-level, rather than word-level, edits. They proposed an HMM based model that takes into account both grapheme and phoneme information. Kobus et al. (2008) undertook a hybrid approach that pulls inspiration from both the machine translation and speech recognition metaphors.","Many other approaches have been examined, most of which are at least partially reliant on the above three metaphors. Cook and Stevenson (2009) perform an unsupervised method, again based on the noisy channel model. Pennell and Liu (2011) developed a CRF tagger for deletion-based abbreviation on tweets. Xue et al. (2011) incorporated orthographic, phonetic, contextual, and acronym expansion factors to normalize words in both Twitter and SMS. Liu et al. (2011) modeled the generation process from dictionary words to non-standard tokens under an unsupervised sequence labeling framework. Han and Baldwin (2011) use a classifier to detect illformed words, and then generate correction can-didates based on morphophonemic similarity. Recent work has looked at the construction of normalization dictionaries (Han et al., 2012) and on improving coverage by integrating different human perspectives (Liu et al., 2012).","Although it is almost universally used as a motivating factor, most normalization work does not directly focus on improving downstream applications. While a few notable exceptions highlight the need for normalization as part of text-to-speech systems (Beaufort et al., 2010; Pennell and Liu, 2010), these works do not give any direct insight into how much the normalization process actually improves the performance of these systems. To our knowledge, the work presented here is the first to clearly link the output of a normalization system to the output of the downstream application. Similarly, our work is the first to prioritize domain adaptation during the new wave of text message normalization."]},{"title":"3 Model","paragraphs":["In this section we introduce our normalization framework, which draws inspiration from our previous work on spelling correction for search (Bao et al., 2011). 3.1 Replacement Generators Our input the original, unnormalized text, represented as a sequence x = x1, x2, . . . , xn of tokens xi. In this section we will use the following se-1160 quence as our running example:","x = Ay1 woudent2 of3 see4 ′ em5 where space replaces comma for readability, and each token is subscripted by its position. Given the input x, we apply a series of replacement generators, where a replacement generator is a function that takes x as input and produces a collection of replacements. Here, a replacement is a statement of the form “replace tokens xi, . . . , xj−1 with s.” More precisely, a replacement is a triple ⟨i, j, s⟩, where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n + 1 and s is a sequence of tokens. Note that in the case where i = j, the sequence s should be inserted right before xi; and in the special case where s is empty, we simply delete xi, . . . , xj−1. For instance, in our running example the replacement ⟨2, 3, would not⟩ replaces x2 = woudent with would not; ⟨1, 2, Ay⟩ replaces x1 with itself (hence, does not change x); ⟨1, 2, ε⟩ (where ε is the empty sequence) deletes x1; ⟨6, 6, .⟩ inserts a period at the end of the sequence.","The provided replacement generators can be either generic (cross domain) or domain-specific, allowing for domain customization. In Section 4, we discuss the replacement generators used in our empirical study. 3.2 Normalization Graph Given the input x and the set of replacements produced by our generators, we associate a unique Boolean variable Xr with each replacement r. As expected, Xr being true means that the replacement r takes place in producing the output sequence.","Next, we introduce dependencies among variables. We first discuss the syntactic consistency of truth assignments. Let r1 = ⟨i1, j1, s1⟩ and r2 = ⟨i2, j2, s2⟩ be two replacements. We say that r1 and r2 are locally consistent if the intervals [i1, j1) and [i2, j2) are disjoint. Moreover, we do not allow two insertions to take place at the same position; therefore, we exclude [i1, j1) and [i2, j2) from the definition of local consistency when i1 = j1 = i2 = j2. If r1 and r2 are locally consistent and j1 = i2, then we say that r2 is a consistent follower of r1.","A truth assignment α to our variables Xr is sound if every two replacements r and r′","with α(Xr) = α(Xr′) = true are locally consistent. We say that α is complete if every token of x is captured by at least one replacement r with α(Xr) = true. Finally, we say that α is legal if it is sound and complete. The output (normalized sequence) defined by a legal assignment α is, naturally, the concatenation (from left to right) of the strings s in the replacements r = ⟨i, j, s⟩ with α(Xr) = true. In Figure 1, for example, if the nodes with a grey shade are the ones associated with true variables under α, then the output defined by α is I would not have seen them.","Our variables carry two types of interdependencies. The first is that of syntactic consistency: the entire assignment is required to be legal. The second captures correlation among replacements. For instance, if we replace of with have in our running example, then the next see token is more likely to be replaced with seen. In this work, dependencies of the second type are restricted to pairs of variables, where each pair corresponds to a replacement and a consistent follower thereof.","The above dependencies can be modeled over a standard undirected graph using Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001). However, the graph would be complex: in order to model local consistency, there should be edges between every two nodes that violate local consistency. Such a model renders inference and learning infeasible. Therefore, we propose a clearer model by a directed graph, as illustrated in Figure 1 (where nodes are represented by replacements r instead of the variables Xr, for readability). To incorpo-rate correlation among replacements, we introduce an edge from Xr to Xr′ whenever r′","is a consistent follower of r. Moreover, we introduce two dummy nodes, start and end, with an edge from start to each variable that corresponds to a prefix of the input sequence x, and an edge from each variable that corresponds to a suffix ofx to end.","The principal advantage of modeling the dependencies in such a directed graph is that now, the legal assignments are in one-to-one correspondence with the paths from start to end; this is a straightforward observation that we do not prove here.","We appeal to the log-linear model formulation to define the probability of an assignment. The conditional probability of an assignment α, given an input sequence x and the weight vector Θ = ⟨θ1, . . . , θk⟩ for our features, is defined as p(α | 1161 ⟨1, 2, I⟩ end ⟨2, 4, would not have⟩ ⟨1, 2, Ay⟩ ⟨5, 6, them⟩ ⟨4, 5, seen⟩ ⟨2, 3, would⟩ ⟨4, 6, see him⟩ ⟨3, 4, of⟩ start ⟨6, 6, .⟩ Figure 1: Example of a normalization graph; the nodes are replacements generated by the replacement generators, and every path from start to end implies a legal assignment x, Θ) = 0 if α is not legal, and otherwise, p(α | x, Θ) =","1 Z(x) ∏ X→Y ∈αexp(∑ j θjφj(X, Y, x)) .

Specifically, we want an assignment α⋆","= arg max","α p(α | x, Θ).","While exact inference is computationally hard on general graph models, in our model it boils down to finding the longest path in a weighted and acyclic directed graph. Indeed, our directed graph (illustrated in Figure 1) is acyclic. We as-sign the real value","∑","j θjφj(X, Y, x) to the edge X → Y , as the weight. As stated in Section 3.2, a legal assignment α corresponds to a path from start to end; moreover, the sum of the weights on that path is equal to log p(α | x, Θ) + log Z(x). In particular, a longer path corresponds to an assignment with greater probability. Therefore, we can solve the MAP inference within our model by finding the weighted longest path in the directed acyclic graph.

In particular, we describe our replacement generators and features. 4.1 Replacement Generators One advantage of our proposed model is that the reliance on replacement generators allows for strong flexibility.

Using that data, a series of generators were created; a sample of them are shown in Table 1. As shown in the table, these generators cover a variety of normalization behavior, from changing non-standard word forms to insert-ing and deleting tokens. 4.2 Features Although the proposed framework supports real valued features, all features in our system are binary. In total, we used 70 features. Our feature set pulls information from several different sources:","N-gram: Our n-gram features indicate the frequency of the phrases induced by an edge. These features are turned into binary ones by bucketing their log values. For example, on the edge from ⟨1, 2, I⟩ to ⟨2, 3, would⟩ such a feature will indicate whether the frequency of I would is over a threshold. We use the Corpus of Contemporary English (Davies, 2008 ) to produce our n-gram information.","Part-of-speech: Part-of-speech information can be used to produce features that encourage certain behavior, such as avoiding the deletion of noun phrases. We generate part-of-speech information over the original raw text using a Twitter part-of-speech tagger (Ritter et al., 2011). Of course, the part-of-speech information obtained this way is likely to be noisy, and we expect our learning algorithm to take that into account.","Positional: Information from positions is used primarily to handle capitalization and punctuation insertion, for example, by incorporating features for capitalized words after stop punctuation or the insertion of stop punctuation at the end of the sentence.","Lineage: Finally, we include binary features 1163 that indicate which generator spawned the replacement."]},{"title":"5 Evaluation","paragraphs":["In this section, we present an empirical study of our framework. The study is done over datasets from three different domains. The goal is to evaluate the framework in two aspects: (1) usefulness for downstream applications (specifically dependency parsing), and (2) domain adaptability. 5.1 Evaluation Metrics A few different metrics have been used to evaluate normalizer performance, including word error rate and BLEU score. While each metric has its pros and cons, they all rely on word-to-word matching and treat each word equally. In this work, we aim to evaluate the performance of a normalizer based on how it affects the performance of downstream applications. We find that the conventional metrics are not directly applicable, for several reasons. To begin with, the assumption that words have equal weights is unlikely to hold. Additionally, these metrics tend to ignore other important non-word information such as punctuation or capitalization. They also cannot take into account other aspects that may have an impact on downstream performance, such as the word reordering as seen in the example in Figure 4. Therefore, we propose a new evaluation metric that directly equates normalization performance with the performance of a common downstream application—dependency parsing.","To realize our desired metric, we apply the following procedure. First, we produce gold standard normalized data by manually normalizing sentences to their full grammatically correct form. In addition to the word-to-word mapping performed in typical normalization gold standard generation, this annotation procedure includes all actions necessary to make the sentence grammatical, such as word reordering, modifying capitalization, and removing emoticons. We then run an off-the-shelf dependency parser on the gold standard normalized data to produce our gold standard parses. Although the parser could still produce mistakes on the grammatical sentences, we feel that this provides a realistic benchmark for comparison, as it represents an upper bound on the possible performance of the parser, and avoids an expensive second round of manual annotation.

For Twitter and SMS messages, we used established datasets to compare with previous work. As no established call-center log dataset exists, we collected our own. In each case, we ran the proposed system with two different configurations: one using only the generic replacement generators presented in Section 4 (denoted as generic), and one that adds additional domain-specific generators for the corresponding domain (denoted as domain-specific). All runs use ten-fold cross validation for training and evaluation.

Because the gold standard used in this work only provided word mappings for out-of-vocabulary words and did not enforce grammaticality, we reannotated the gold standard data2",". Their original gold standard annotations were kept as a baseline.","To produce Twitter-specific generators, we examined the Twitter development data collected for generic generator production (Section 4). These generators focused on the Twitter-specific notions of hashtags (#), ats (@), and retweets (RT). For each case, we implemented generators that allowed for either the initial symbol or the entire token to be deleted (e.g., @Hertz to Hertz, @Hertz to ε).","The results are given in Table 2. As shown, the domain-specific generators yielded performance significantly above the generic ones and all baselines. Even without domain-specific generators, our system outperformed the word-to-word normalization approaches. Most notably, both the generic and domain-specific systems outperformed the gold standard word-to-word normalizations. These results validate the hypothesis that simple word-to-word normalization is insufficient if the goal of normalization is to improve dependency parsing; even if a system could produce perfect word-to-word normalization, it would produce lower quality parses than those produced by our approach. 2","Our results and the reannotations of the Twitter and SMS data are available at https://www.cs.washington. edu/node/9091/ System Verb Subject-Object","Pre Rec F1 Pre Rec F1 w/oN 83.7 68.1 75.1 31.7 38.6 34.8 Google 88.9 78.8 83.5 36.1 46.3 40.6 w2wN 87.5 81.5 84.4 44.5 58.9 50.7 Gw2w 89.8 83.8 86.7 46.9 61.0 53.0 generic 91.7 88.9 90.3 53.6 70.2 60.8","domain specific 95.3 88.7 91.9 72.5 76.3 74.4 Table 2: Performance on Twitter dataset 5.2.2 SMS To evaluate the performance on SMS data, we use the Treasure My Text data collected by Choudhury et al.

As a replacement generator for SMS-specific substitutions, we used a mapping dictionary of SMS abbreviations.3","No further SMS-specific development data was needed.","Table 3 gives the results on the SMS data. The SMS dataset proved to be more difficult than the Twitter dataset, with the overall performance of every system being lower. While this drop of performance may be a reflection of the difference in data styles between SMS and Twitter, it is also likely a product of the collection methodology. The collection methodology of the Treasure My Text dataset dictated that every message must have at least one mistake, which may have resulted in a dataset that was noisier than average.","Nonetheless, the trends on SMS data mirror those on Twitter data, with the domain-specific generators achieving the greatest overall performance. However, while the generic setting still manages to outperform most baselines, it did not outperform the gold word-to-word normalization. In fact, the gold word-to-word normalization was much more competitive on this data, outperform-ing even the domain-specific system on verbs alone.

The examination of call-center logs allows us to examine the ability of our system to perform normalization in more disparate domains. Our call-center data consists of text-based responses to questions about a user’s experience with a call-center (e.g., their overall satisfaction with the service).

The relatively modest set of additional replacement generators included in each data set allowed the domain-specific approaches to significantly outperform the generic approach. In the call-center case, performance improvements could be seen by referencing a very small amount of development data. In the SMS case, the presence of a domain-specific dictionary allowed for performance improvements without the need for any development data at all. It is likely, though not established, that employing further development data would result in further performance improvements. We leave further investigation to future work.","The results in Section 5.2 establish a point that has often been assumed but, to the best of our knowledge, has never been explicitly shown: performing normalization is indeed beneficial to dependency parsing on informal text. The parse of the normalized text was substantially better than the parse of the original raw text in all domains, with absolute performance increases ranging from about 18-25% on subjects and objects. Further-more, the results suggest that, as hypothesized, preparing an informal text for a parsing task requires more than simple word-to-word normalization. The proposed approach significantly outper-forms the state-of-the-art word-to-word normalization approach. Perhaps most interestingly, the proposed approach performs on par with, and in several cases superior to, gold standard word-to-word annotations. This result gives strong evidence for the conclusion that parser-targeted normalization requires a broader understanding of the scope of the normalization task.","While the work presented here gives promis-ing results, there are still many behaviors found in informal text that prove challenging. One such example is the word reordering seen in Figure 4. Although word reordering could be incorporated into the model as a combination of a deletion and an insertion, the model as currently devised cannot easily link these two replacements to one another. Additionally, instances of reordering proved hard to detect in practice. As such, no reordering-based replacement generators were implemented in the presented system. Another case that proved difficult was the insertion of missing tokens. For instance, the informal sentence “ Day 3 still don’t freaking 1166 feel good!:(” could be formally rendered as “ It is day 3 and I still do not feel good!”. Attempts to address missing tokens in the model resulted in frequent false positives. Similarly, punctuation insertion proved to be challenging, often requiring a deep analysis of the sentence. For example, contrast the sentence “ I’m watching a movie I don’t know its name.” which would benefit from inserted punctuation, with “ I’m watching a movie I don’t know.”, which would not. We feel that the work presented here provides a foundation for future work to more closely examine these challenges."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions","paragraphs":["This work presents a framework for normalization with an eye towards domain adaptation. The proposed framework builds a statistical model over a series of replacement generators. By doing so, it allows a designer to quickly adapt a generic model to a new domain with the inclusion of a small set of domain-specific generators. Tests over three different domains suggest that, using this model, only a small amount of domain-specific data is necessary to tailor an approach towards a new domain.","Additionally, this work introduces a parser-centric view of normalization, in which the performance of the normalizer is directly tied to the performance of a downstream dependency parser. This evaluation metric allows for a deeper understanding of how certain normalization actions impact the output of the parser. Using this metric, this work established that, when dependency parsing is the goal, typical word-to-word normalization approaches are insufficient. By taking a broader look at the normalization task, the approach presented here is able to outperform not only state-of-the-art word-to-word normalization approaches but also manual word-to-word annotations.","Although the work presented here established that more than word-to-word normalization was necessary to produce parser-ready normalizations, it remains unclear which specific normalization tasks are most critical to parser performance. We leave this interesting area of examination to future work."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank the anonymous reviewers of ACL for helpful comments and suggestions.
