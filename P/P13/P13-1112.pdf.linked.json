Although there has been plenty of work on mother tongue interference, very little is known about how strongly it is transferred to another language and about what relation there is across mother tongues. To address these questions, this paper explores and visualizes mother tongue interference preserved in English texts written by Indo-European language speakers. This paper further explores linguistic features that explain why certain relations are preserved in English writing, and which contribute to related tasks such as native language identification."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Transfer of linguistic systems of a mother tongue to another language, namely mother tongue interference, is often observable in the writing of non-native speakers. The reader may be able to determine the mother tongue of the writer of the following sentence from the underlined article error: The alien wouldn’t use my spaceship but the hers. The answer would probably be French or Spanish; the definite article is allowed to modify possessive pronouns in these languages, and the usage is sometimes negatively transferred to English writing. Researchers such as Swan and Smith (2001), Aarts and Granger (1998), Davidsen-Nielsen and Harder (2001), and Altenberg and Tapper (1998) work on mother tongue interference to reveal overused/underused words, part of speech (POS), or grammatical items.","In contrast, very little is known about how strongly mother tongue interference is transferred to another language and about what relation there is across mother tongues. At one extreme, one could argue that it is so strongly transferred to texts in another language that the linguistic relations between mother tongues are perfectly preserved in the texts. At the other extreme, one can counter it, arguing that other features such as non-nativeness are more influential than mother tongue interference. One possible reason for this is that a large part of the distinctive language systems of a mother tongue may be eliminated when transferred to another language from a speaker’s mother tongue. For example, Slavic languages have a rich inflectional case system (e.g., Czech has seven inflectional cases) whereas French does not. However, the difference in the richness cannot be transferred into English because English has almost no inflectional case system. Thus, one cannot determine the mother tongue of a given non-native text from the inflectional case. A similar argument can be made about some parts of gender, tense, and aspect systems. Besides, Wong and Dras (2009) show that there are no significant differences, between mother tongues, in the misuse of certain syntactic features such as subject-verb agreement that have different tendencies depend-ing on their mother tongues. Considering these, one could not be so sure which argument is correct. In any case, to the best of our knowledge, no one has yet answered this question.","In view of this background, we take the first step in addressing this question. We hypothesize that:","Hypothesis: Mother tongue interference is so strong that the relations in a language family are preserved in texts written in another language. In other words, mother tongue interference is so strong that one can reconstruct a language fam-1137 ily tree from non-native texts. One of the major contributions of this work is to reveal and visualize a language family tree preserved in non-native texts, by examining the hypothesis. This becomes important in native language identification1","which is useful for improving grammatical error correction systems (Chodorow et al., 2010) or for providing more targeted feedback to language learners. As we will see in Sect. 6, this paper reveals several crucial findings that contribute to improving native language identification. In addition, this paper shows that the findings could contribute to reconstruction of language family trees (Enright and Kondrak, 2011; Gray and Atkinson, 2003; Barbanco̧n et al., 2007; Batagelj et al., 1992; Nakhleh et al., 2005), which is one of the central tasks in historical linguistics.","The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Sect. 2 introduces the basic approach of this work. Sect. 3 discusses the methods in detail. Sect. 4 describes experiments conducted to investigate the hypothesis. Sect. 5 discusses the experimental results. Sect. 6 discusses implications for work in related domains."]},{"title":"2 Approach","paragraphs":["To examine the hypothesis, we reconstruct a language family tree from English texts written by non-native speakers of English whose mother tongue is one of the Indo-European languages (Beekes, 2011; Ramat and Ramat, 2006). If the reconstructed tree is sufficiently similar to the original Indo-European family tree, it will support the hypothesis. If not, it suggests that some features other than mother tongue interference are more influential.","The approach we use for reconstructing a language family tree is to apply agglomerative hierarchical clustering (Han and Kamber, 2006) to English texts written by non-native speakers. Researchers have already performed related work on reconstructing language family trees. For in-stance, Kroeber and Chriétien (1937) and Ellegård (1959) proposed statistical methods for measuring the similarity metric between languages. More recently, Batagelj et al. (1992) and Kita (1999) proposed methods for reconstructing language family trees using clustering. Among them, the","1","Recently, native language identification has drawn the at-tention of NLP researchers. For instance, a shared task on native language identification took place at an NAACL-HLT 2013 workshop. most related method is that of Kita (1999). In his method, a variety of languages are modeled by their spelling systems (i.e., character-based n-gram language models). Then, agglomerative hierarchical clustering is applied to the language models to reconstruct a language family tree. The similarity used for clustering is based on a divergence-like distance between two language models that was originally proposed by Juang and Rabiner (1985). This method is purely data-driven and does not require human expert knowledge for the selection of linguistic features.","Our work closely follows Kita’s work. However, it should be emphasized that there is a significant difference between the two. Kita’s work (and other previous work) targets clustering of a variety of languages whereas our work tries to reconstruct a language family tree preserved in non-native English. This significant difference prevents us from directly applying techniques in the literature to our task. For instance, Batagelj et al. (1992) use basic vocabularies such as belly in English and ventre in French to measure similarity between languages. Obviously, this does not work on our task; belly is belly in English writing whoever writes it. Kita’s method is also likely not to work well because all texts in our task share the same spelling system (i.e., English spelling). Although spelling is sometimes influenced by mother tongues, it involves a lot more including overuse, underuse, and misuse of lexical, grammatical, and syntactic systems.","To solve the problem, this work adopts a word-based language model in the expectation that word sequences reflect mother tongue interference. At the same time, its simple application would cause a serious side effect. It would reflect the topics of given texts rather than mother tongue interference. Unfortunately, there exists no such English corpus that covers a variety of language speakers with uniform topics; moreover the availability of non-native corpora is still somewhat limited. This also means that available non-native corpora may be too small to train reliable word-based language models. The next section describes two methods (language model-based and vector-based), which address these problems."]},{"title":"3 Methods 3.1 Language Model-based Method","paragraphs":["To begin with, let us define the following symbols used in the methods. Let Di be a set of English 1138 texts where i denotes a mother tongue i. Similarly, let Mi be a language model trained using Di.","To solve the problems pointed out in Sect. 2, we use an n-gram language model based on a mixture of word and POS tokens instead of a simple word-based language model. In this language model, content words in n-grams are replaced with their corresponding POS tags. This greatly decreases the influence of the topics of texts, as desired. It also decreases the number of parameters in the language model.","To build the language model, the following three preprocessing steps are applied to Di. First, texts in Di are split into sentences. Second, each sentence is tokenized, POS-tagged, and mapped entirely to lowercase. For instance, the first example sentence in Sect. 1 would give: the/DT alien/NN would/MD not/RB use/VB my/PRP$ spaceship/NN but/CC the/DT hers/PRP ./. Finally, words are replaced with their corresponding POS tags; for the following words, word tokens are used as their corresponding POS tags: coordinating conjunctions, determiners, prepositions, modals, predeterminers, possessives, pronouns, question adverbs. Also, proper nouns are treated as common nouns. At this point, the special POS tags BOS and EOS are added at the beginning and end of each sentence, respectively. For instance, the above example would result in the following word/POS sequence: BOS the NN would RB VB my NN but the hers . EOS Note that the content of the original sentence is far from clear while reflecting mother tongue interference, especially in the hers.","Now, the language model Mi can be built from Di. We set n = 3 (i.e., trigram language model) following Kita’s work and use Kneser-Ney (KN) smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995) to estimate its conditional probabilities.","With Mi and Di, we can naturally apply Kita’s method to our task. The clustering algorithm used is agglomerative hierarchical clustering with the average linkage method. The distance2","between two language models is measured as follows. The","2","It is not a distance in a mathematical sense. However, we will use the term distance following the convention in the literature. probability that Mi generates Di is calculated by Pr(Di|Mi). Note that Pr(Di|Mi) ≈ Pr(w1,i) Pr(w2,i|w1,i) × |Di| ∏ t=3 Pr(wt,i|wt−2,i, wt−1,i) (1) where wt,i and |Di| denote the tth token in Di and the number of tokens in Di, respectively, since we use the trigram language model. Then, the distance from Mi to Mj is defined by d(Mi → Mj) = 1 |Dj| log Pr(Dj|Mj) Pr(Dj|Mi) . (2) In other words, the distance is determined based on the ratio of the probabilities that each language model generates the language data. Because d(Mi → Mj) and d(Mj → Mi) are not symmetrical, we define the distance between Mi and Mj to be their average: d(Mi, Mj) =","d(Mi → Mj)+d(Mj → Mi) 2 . (3) Equation (3) is used to calculate the distance between two language models for clustering.","To sum up, the procedure of the language family tree construction method is as follows: (i) Preprocess each Di; (ii) Build Mi from Di; (iii) Calculate the distances between the language models; (iv) Cluster the language data using the distances; (v) Output the result as a language family tree. 3.2 Vector-based Method We also examine a vector-based method for language family tree reconstruction. As we will see in Sect. 5, this method allows us to interpret clustering results more easily than with the language model-based method while both result in similar language family trees.","In this method, Di is modeled by a vector. The vector is constructed based on the relative frequencies of trigrams. As a consequence, the distance is naturally defined by the Euclidean distance between two vectors. The clustering procedure is the same as for the language model-based method except that Mi is vector-based and that the distance metric is Euclidean. 1139"]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["We selected the ICLE corpus v.2 (Granger et al., 2009) as the target language data. It consists of English essays written by a wide variety of non-native speakers of English. Among them, the 11 shown in Table 1 are of Indo-European languages. Accordingly, we selected the subcorpora of the 11 languages in the experiments. Before the experiments, we preprocessed the corpus data to control the experimental conditions. Because some of the writers had more than one native language, we excluded essays that did not meet the following three conditions: (i) the writer has only one native language; (ii) the writer has only one language at home; (iii) the two languages in (i) and (ii) are the same as the native language of the subcorpus to which the essay belongs3",". After the selection, markup tags such as essay IDs were removed from the corpus data. Also, the symbols ‘ and ’ were unified into ’ 4",".

Existing POS taggers might not perform well on non-native English texts because they are normally developed to analyze native English texts.

While the difference exists, the method strongly distinguishes the three branches from one another. The third tree shows that the vector-based method behaves similarly while it mistakenly at-taches Polish-English into an independent branch. From these results, we can say that mother tongue interference is transferred into the 11 Englishes, strongly enough for reconstructing its language family tree, which we propose calling the interlanguage Indo-European family tree in English.","Fig. 2 shows the experimental results with native and Japanese Englishes. It shows that the same interlanguage Indo-European family tree was reconstructed as before. More interestingly, native English was detached from the interlanguage Indo-European family tree contrary to the expectation that it would be attached to the Germanic branch because English is of course a mem-ber of the Germanic branch. This implies that non-nativeness common to the 11 Englishes is more influential than the intrafamily distance is9",";","9","Admittedly, we need further investigation to confirm this argument especially because we applied CRFTagger, which is developed to analyze native English, to both non-native and native Englishes, which might affect the results.

This shows that the interfamily distance is the most influential factor. Based on these results, we can further hypothesize as follows: interfamily distance > non-nativeness > intrafamily distance."]},{"title":"5 Discussion","paragraphs":["To get a better understanding of the interlanguage Indo-European family tree, we further explore linguistic features that explain well the above phenomena. When we analyze the experimental results, however, some problems arise. It is almost impossible to find someone who has a good knowledge of the 11 languages and their mother language interference in English writing. Besides, there are a large number of language pairs to compare. Thus, we need an efficient and effective way to analyze the experimental results.","To address these problems, we did the following. First, we focused on only a few Englishes out of the 11. Because one of the authors had some knowledge of French, we selected French-English as the main target. This naturally made us select the other Italic Englishes as its counterparts. Also, because we had access to a native speaker of Russian who had a good knowledge of English, we included Russian-English in our focus. We analyzed these Englishes and then examined whether the findings obtained apply to the other Englishes or not. Second, we used a method for extracting interesting trigrams from the corpus data. The method compares three out of the 11 corpora (for example, French-, Spanish-, and Russian-Englishes). If we remove instances of a trigram from each set, the clustering tree involving 1141 the three may change. For example, the removal of but the hers may result in a cluster tree merg-ing French- and Russian-Englishes before French-and Spanish-Englishes. Even if it does not change, the distances may change in that direction. We analyzed what trigrams had contributed to the clustering results with this approach.","To formalize this approach, we will denote a trigram by t. We will also denote its relative frequency in the language data Di by rti. Then, the change in the distances caused by the removal of t from Di, Dj, and Dk is quantified by","s = (rtk − rti)2 − (r","tj − rti)2 (4) in the vector-based method. The quantity (rtk − rti)2","is directly related to the decrease in the distance between Di and Dk and similarly, (rtj − rti)2","to that between Di and Dj in the vector-based method. Thus, the greater s is, the higher the chance that the cluster tree changes. Therefore, we can obtain a list of interesting trigrams by sorting them according to s. We could do a similar calculation in the language model-based method using the conditional probabilities. However, it requires a more complicated calculation. Accordingly, we limit ourselves to the vector-based method in this analysis, noting that both methods generated similar cluster trees.","Table 2 shows the top 15 interesting trigrams where Di, Dj, and Dk are French-, Spanish-, and Russian-Englishes, respectively. Note that s is multiplied by 106","and r is in % for readability. The list reveals that many of the trigrams contain the article a or the. Interestingly, their frequencies are similar in French-English and Spanish-English, and both are higher than in Russian-English. This corresponds to the fact that French and Spanish have articles whereas Russian does not. Actually, the same argument can be made about the other Italic and Slavic Englishes (e.g., the JJ NN: Italian-English 0.82; Polish-English 0.72) 10",". An exception is that of trigrams containing the definite article in Bulgarian-English; it tends to be higher in Bulgarian-English than in the other Slavic Englishes. Surprisingly and interestingly, however, it reflects the fact that Bulgarian does have the definite article but not the indefinite article (e.g., the JJ NN: 0.82; a JJ NN: 0.60 in Bulgarian-English).","10","Due to the space limitation, other lists were not included in this paper but are available at http://web.hyogo-u. ac.jp/nagata/acl/.","Table 3 shows that the differences in article use exist even between the Italic and Germanic branches despite the fact that both have the indefinite and definite articles. The list still contains a number of trigrams containing articles. For a better understanding of this, we looked further into the distribution of articles in the corpus data. It turns out that the distribution almost perfectly groups the 11 Englishes into the corresponding branches as shown in Fig. 3. The overall use of articles is less frequent in the Slavic-Englishes. The definite article is used more frequently in the Italic-Englishes than in the Germanic Englishes (except for Dutch-English). We speculate that this is perhaps because the Italic languages have a wider usage of the definite article such as its modification of possessive pronouns and proper nouns. The Japanese Englishes form another group (this is also true for the following findings). This corresponds to the fact that the Japanese language does not have an article system similar to that of English. s Trigram t rti rtj rtk 5.14 the NN of 1.01 0.98 0.78 4.38 a JJ NN 0.85 0.77 0.62 2.74 the JJ NN 0.87 0.86 0.71 2.30 NN of the 0.49 0.52 0.33 1.64 . . . 0.22 0.12 0.05 1.56 NNS .

In the Italic Englishes, the trigram is more frequent than the other non-native Englishes as shown in Fig. 4. This corresponds to the fact that noun-noun compounds are less common in the Italic languages than in English and that instead, the of -phrase ( NN of NN) is preferred (Swan and Smith, 2001).

In contrast, noun-noun compounds or similar constructions are more common in Russian and Swedish. As a result, NN of NN becomes relatively frequent in the Italic Englishes. Fig. 4 also shows that its distribution roughly groups the 11 Englishes into the three branches. Therefore, the way noun phrases (NPs) are constructed is a clue to how the three branches were clustered.","This finding in turn reveals that the consecutive repetitions of nouns occur less in the Italic Englishes. In other words, the length tends to be shorter than in the others where we define the length as the number of consecutive repetitions of common nouns (for example, the length of orange juice is one because a noun is consecutively repeated once). To see if this is true, we calculated the average length for each English. Fig. 5 shows that the average length roughly distinguishes the Italic Englishes from the other non-native Englishes; French-English is the shortest, which is explained by the discussion above, while Dutch- and German-Englishes are longest, which may correspond to the fact that they have a preference for noun-noun compounds as Snyder (1996) argues. For instance, German allows the concatenated form as in Orangensaft (equivalently or-angejuice).

(2011; 2012), and Koppel et al. (2005) work on native language identification and show that machine learning-based methods are effective. Wong and Dras (2009) propose using information about grammatical errors such as errors in determiners to achieve better performance while they show that its use does not improve the performance, contrary to the expectation. Related to this, other researchers (Koppel and Ordan, 2011; van Halteren, 2008) show that machine learning-based methods can also predict the source language of a given translated text although it should be emphasized that it is a different task from native language identification because translation is not typically performed by non-native speakers but rather native speakers of the target language11",".","The experimental results show that n-grams containing articles are predictive for identify-ing native languages. This indicates that they should be used in the native language identification task. Importantly, all n-grams containing articles should be used in the classifier unlike the previous methods that are based only on n-grams containing article errors. Besides, no articles should be explicitly coded in n-grams for taking the overuse/underuse of articles into consideration. We can achieve this by adding a special symbol such as φ to the beginning of each NP whose head noun is a common noun and that has no determiner in it as in “I like φ orange juice.”","In addition, the length of noun-noun compounds and the position of adverbs should also be considered in native language identification. In particular, the former can be modeled by the Poisson distribution as follows. The Poisson distribution gives the probability of the number of events occurring in a fixed time. In our case, the number of events in a fixed time corresponds to the number of consecutive repetitions of common nouns in NPs, which in turn corresponds to the length. To be precise, the probability of a noun-noun compound with length l is given by Pr(l) = λl l!","e−λ , (5) where λ corresponds to the average length.

This holds for the other Englishes although we cannot show them because of the space limitation. Consequently, Equation (5) should be useful in native language identification. Fortunately, it can be naturally integrated into existing classifiers.","In the domain of historical linguistics, researchers have used computational and corpus-based methods for reconstructing language family trees. Some (Enright and Kondrak, 2011; Gray and Atkinson, 2003; Barbanco̧n et al., 2007; Batagelj et al., 1992; Nakhleh et al., 2005) apply clustering techniques to the task of language family tree reconstruction. Others (Kita, 1999; Rama and Singh, 2009) use corpus statistics for the same purpose. These methods reconstruct language family trees based on linguistic features that exist within words including lexical, phonological, and morphological features.","The experimental results in this paper suggest the possibility of the use of non-native texts for reconstructing language family trees. It allows us to use linguistic features that exist between words, as seen in our methods, which has been difficult with previous methods. Language involves the features between words such as phrase construction and syntax as well as the features within words and thus they should both be considered in reconstruc-","12","The theoretical and observed values are so close that it is difficult to distinguish between the two lines in Fig. 7. For example, Pr(l = 1) = 0.0303 while the corresponding observed value is 0.0299. tion of language family trees."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have shown that mother tongue interference is so strong that the relations between members of the Indo-European language family are preserved in English texts written by Indo-European language speakers. To show this, we have used clustering to reconstruct a language family tree from 11 sets of non-native English texts. It turned out that the reconstructed tree correctly groups them into the Italic, Germanic, and Slavic branches of the Indo-European family tree. Based on the resulting trees, we have then hypothesized that the following relation holds in mother tongue interference: interfamily distance > non-nativeness > intrafamily distance. We have further explored several intriguing linguistic features that play an important role in mother tongue interference: (i) article use, (ii) NP construction, and (iii) adverb position, which provide several insights for improving the tasks of native language identification and language family tree reconstruction."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was partly supported by the Digiteo for-eign guest project.
