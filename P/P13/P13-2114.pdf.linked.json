Some-times events and times are related through use of an explicit co-ordination which gives information about the temporal relation: expressions like “before” and “as soon as”. We investigate the rôle that these co-ordinating temporal signals have in determining the type of temporal relations in discourse. Using machine learning, we improve upon prior approaches to the problem, achieving over 80% accuracy at labelling the types of temporal relation between events and times that are related by temporal signals."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["It is important to understand time in language. The ability to express and comprehend expressions of time enables us to plan, to tell stories, and to discuss change in the world around us.","When we automatically extract temporal information, we are often concerned with events and times – referred to collectively as temporal intervals. We might ask, for example, “Who is the current President of the USA?.” In order to extract an answer to this question from a document collection, we need to identify events related to persons becoming president and the times of those events. Crucially, however, we also need to identify the temporal relations between these events and times, perhaps, for example, by recognizing a temporal relation type from a set such as that of Allen (1983). This last task, temporal relation typing, is challeng-ing, and is the focus of this paper.","Temporal signals are words or phrases that act as discourse markers that co-ordinate a pair of events or times and explicitly state the nature of the temporal relation that holds between them. For example, in “The parade reached the town hall before noon”, the word before is a temporal signal, co-ordinating the event reached with the time noon. Intuitively, these signal words act as discourse contain temporal ordering information that human readers can readily access, and in-deed this hypothesis is borne out empirically (Bestgen and Vonk, 1999). In this paper, we present an in-depth examination into the role temporal signals can play in machine learning for temporal relation typing, within the framework of TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2005)."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Temporal relation typing is not a new problem. Classical work using TimeML is that of Boguraev and Ando (2005), Mani et al. (2007) and Yoshikawa et al. (2009). The TempEval challenge series features relation typing as a key task (Verhagen et al., 2009). The take-home message from all this work is that temporal relation typing is a hard problem, even using advanced techniques and extensive engineering – approaches rarely achieve over 60% on typing relations between two events or over 75% accuracy for those between an event and a time. Recent attempts to include more linguistically sophisticated features representing discourse, syntactic and semantic role information have yielded but marginal improvements, e.g. Llorens et al. (2010); Mirroshandel et al. (2011).","Although we focus solely on determining the types of temporal relations, one must also identify which pairs of temporal intervals should be temporally related. Previous work has covered the tasks of identifying and typing temporal relations jointly with some success (Denis and Muller, 2011; Do et al., 2012). The TempEval3 challenge addresses exactly this task (Uz-Zaman et al., 2013).","Investigations into using signals for temporal relation typing have had promising results. Lapata and Lascarides (2006) learn temporal structure according to these explicit signals, then predict temporal orderings in sentences without signals. As part of an early TempEval system, Min et al. (2007) automatically an-notate signals and associate them with temporal relations. They then include the signal text as a feature for a relation type classifier.

The system achieves a 22% error reduction on a simplified set of temporal relation types.","Later, Derczynski and Gaizauskas (2010) saw a 50% error reduction in assignment of relation types on signalled relation instances from introducing simple features describing a temporal signal’s interaction with the events or times that it co-ordinates. The features for describing signals included the signal text itself and the signal’s position in the document relative to the intervals it co-ordinated. This led to a large increase in relation typing accuracy to 82.19% for signalled event-event relations, using a maximum entropy classifier.","Previous work has attempted to linguistically characterise temporal signals (Brée et al., 1993; Derczynski and Gaizauskas, 2011). Signal phrases typically fall into one of three categories: monosemous as temporal signals (e.g. “during”, “when”); bisemous as temporal or spatial signals (e.g. “before”); or polysemous with the temporal sense a minority class (e.g. “in”, “following”). Further, a signal phrase may take two arguments, though its arguments need not be in the immediate content and may be anaphoric. We leave the task of automatic signal annotation to future work, instead focusing on the impact that signals have on temporal relation typing.","Our work builds on previous work by expanding the study to include relations other than just event-event relations, by extending the feature set, by doing temporal relation labelling over a more carefully curated version of the TimeBank corpus (see below), and by providing detailed analysis of the performance of a set of labelling techniques when using temporal signals."]},{"title":"3 Experimental Setup","paragraphs":["We only approach the relation typing task, and we use existing signal annotations – that is, we do not attempt to automatically identify temporal signals.","The corpus used is the signal-curated version of TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003). This corpus, TB-sig,1","adds extra events, times and relations to TimeBank, in an effort to correct signal under-annotation in the original corpus (Derczynski and Gaizauskas, 2011). Like the original TimeBank corpus, it comprises 183 documents. In these, we are interested only in the temporal relations that use a signal. There are 851 signals annotated in the corpus, co-ordinating 886 temporal re-1 See http://derczynski.com/sheffield/resources/tb sig.tar.bz2 lations (13.7% of all). For comparison, TimeBank has 688 signal annotations which co-ordinate 718 temporal relations (11.2%).","When evaluating classifiers, we performed 10-fold cross-validation, keeping splits at document level. There are only 14 signalled time-time relations in this corpus, which is not enough to support any generalizations, and so we disregard this interval type pairing.","As is common with statistical approaches to temporal relation typing, we also perform relation folding; that is, to reduce the number of possible classes, we sometimes invert argument order and relation type. For example, A BEFORE B and B AFTER A convey the same temporal relation, and so we can remove all AFTER-type relations by swapping their argument order and converting them to BEFORE relations. This lossless process condenses the labels that our classifier has to distinguish between, though classification remains a multi-class problem.","We adopt the base feature set of Mani et al. (2007), which consists mainly of TimeML event and time annotation surface attributes. These are, for events: class, aspect, modality, tense, polarity, part of speech; and, for times: value, type, function in document, mod, quant. To these are added same-tense and same-aspect features, as well as the string values of events/times.","The feature groups we use here are:","• Base – The attributes of TimeML annotations in-volved (includes tense, aspect, polarity and so on as above), as with previous approaches.","• Argument Ordering – Two features: a boolean set if both arguments are in the same sentence (as in Chambers et al. (2007)), and the text order of argument intervals (as in Hepple et al. (2007)).","• Signal Ordering – Textual ordering is important with temporal signals; compare “You walk before you run” and “Before you walk you run”. We add features accounting for relative textual position of signal and arguments as per Derczynski and Gaizauskas (2010). To these we add a feature reporting whether the signal occurs in first, last, or mid-sentence position, and features to indicate whether each interval is in the same sentence as the signal.","• Syntactic – We add syntactic features: following Bethard et al.

Linear support vector classification provided rapid labelling and comparable performance for event-event relations but was accuracy was not as good as random forests for event-time relation labelling.","Note, figures reported earlier in Derczynski and Gaizauskas (2010) are not directly comparable to the DG2010 figures reported here, as here we are using the better-annotated TB-sig corpus, which contains a larger and more varied set of temporal signal annotations.","Although we are only examining the 13.7% of temporal relations that are co-ordinated with a signal, it is important to note the performance of conventional classification approaches on this subset of temporal relations. Specifically, the error reduction relative to the baseline that is achieved without signal features is much lower on relations that use signals than on non-signalled relations (Table 1). Thus, temporal relations that use a signal appear to be more difficult to classify than other relations, unless signal information is present in the features. This may be due to differences in how signals are used by authors. One explanation is that signals may be used in the stead of temporal ordering information in surrounding discourse, such as modulations of dominant tense or aspect (Derczynski and Gaizauskas, 2013).","Unlike earlier work using maxent, we experiment with a variety of classifiers, and find a consistent improvement in temporal relation typing using signal features. With the notable exception of adaptive boosting, classifiers with preference bias (Liu et al., 2002) – AdaBoost, random trees and SVC – performed best in this task. Conversely, those tending toward the in-dependence assumption (naı̈ve Bayes and maxent) did not capitalise as effectively on the training data.

Bold figures indicate largest performance change.","We also investigated the impact of each feature group on the best-performing classifier (random forests with n = 200) through feature ablation. Results are given in Table 3. Ablation suggested that the signal text features (signal string, lower case string, head word and lemma) had most impact in event-event relation typing, though were second to syntax features in event-time relations. Removing other feature groups gave only minor performance decreases.","We also experimented with adding feature groups to the base set one-by-one. All but DCT features gave above-baseline improvement, though argument ordering features were not very helpful for event-event relation typing. Signal text features gave the strongest improvement over baseline for event-event relations, but syntax gave a larger improvement for event-time relations. Accordingly, it may be useful to distinguish between event-event and event-time relations when extracting temporal information using syntax (c.f. the approach of Wang et al. (2010)).","A strong above-baseline performance was still obtained even when signal text features were removed, which included the signal text itself. This was interest-ing, as signal phrases can indicate quite different temporal orderings (e.g. “Open the box while it rains” vs. “Open the box before it rains”, and the words used are typically critical to correct interpretation of the temporal relation. Further, the model is able to generalise beyond particular signal phrase choices. To investigate further, we examined the performance impact of each group sans “signal text” features (Table 4). In this case, removing the syntactic features had the greatest (negative) impact on performance, though the absolute impact on event-event relations (a drop of 11.3%) was far lower than that on event-time relations (3.7%).","To examine helpful features, we trained a maxent classifier on the entire dataset and collected feature:value pairs. These were then ranked by their weight. The ten largest-weighted pairings for event-event relations (the hardest problem in overall temporal relation typing) are given in Table 5. Prefixes of 1- and 2- correspond to the two interval arguments (events). Negative values are those where the presence of a particular feature:value pair suggests the mentioned class is not applicable."]},{"title":"648 Weight Feature Value Class","paragraphs":["9.346 2-polarity POS ENDS -8.713 1-2-same-sent True BEGINS -7.861 2-aspect NONE BEGINS -7.256 1-aspect NONE INCLUDES 6.564 2-sig-synt-path NN-NP-IN INCLUDES 6.519 signal-lower before ENDS -6.294 2-tense NONE BEGINS -5.908 2-modality None ENDS 5.643 2-text took BEGINS -5.580 1-modality None ENDS Table 5: Top ten largest-weighted feature:value pairs.","It can be seen that BEGINS and INCLUDES relationships are not indicated if the arguments have no TimeML aspect assigned; this is what one might expect, given how aspect is used in English, with these temporal relation types corresponding to event starts and the progressive. Also, notice how a particular syntactic path, connecting adjacent nominalised event and the word in acting as a signal, indicate a temporal inclusion relationship. Temporal polysemy, where a word has more than one possible temporal interpretation, is also observable here (Derczynski and Gaizauskas (2011) examine this polysemy in depth). This is visible in how the temporal signal phrase “before” is not, as one might expect, a strong indicator of a BEFORE or even AFTER relation, but of an ENDS relationship."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper set out to investigate the rôle of temporal signals in predicting the type of temporal relation between two intervals. The paper demonstrated the utility of temporal signals in this task, and identified approaches for using the information these signals contain, which performed consistently better than the state-of-the-art across a range of machine learning classifiers. Further, it identified the impact that signal text, signal order and syntax features had in temporal relation typing of signalled relations.","Two directions of future work are indicated. Firstly, the utility of signals prompts investigation into detect-ing which words in a given text occur as temporal signals. Secondly, it is intuitive that temporal signals explicitly indicate related pairs of intervals (i.e. events or times). So, the task of deciding which interval pair(s) a temporal signal co-ordinates must be approached.","Although we have found a method for achieving good temporal relation typing performance on a subset of temporal relations, the greater problem of general temporal relation typing remains. A better understand-ing of the semantics of events, times, signals and how they are related together through syntax may provide further insights into the temporal relation typing task.","Finally, Bethard et al. (2007) reached high temporal relation typing performance on one a subset of relations (events and times in the same sentence); we reach high temporal relation typing performance on another subset of relations – those using a temporal signal. Identify-ing further explicit sources of temporal information applicable to new sets of relations may reveal promising paths for investigation."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The first author was supported by UK EPSRC grant EP/K017896/1, uComp (http://www.ucomp.eu/)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["J.
