This task is more challenging in the presence of multilingual text, because translating named entities (NEs), such as persons, locations, or organizations, is a non-trivial task. Early research on NE translation used phonetic similarities, for example, to mine the translation ‘Mandelson’ →‘ 曼 德 尔 森’[ManDeErSen] with similar sounds. However, not all NE translations are based on translitera-tions, as shown in Table 1—Some translations, especially the names of most organizations, are based on semantic equivalences. Furthermore, names can be abbreviated in one or both languages, e.g., the ‘World Trade Organization’ ( 世 界贸易组织) can be called the ‘WTO’ ( 世贸组 织). Another challenging example is that, a translation can be arbitrary, e.g., ‘Jackie Chan’ → ‘ 成 龙’ [ChengLong]. There are many approaches English Chinese World Trade Organization","世界贸易组织","[ShiJieMaoYiZuZhi]","WTO 世贸组织 [ShiMaoZuZhi]","Jackie Chan 成龙 [ChengLong] Table 1: Examples of non-phonetic translations. that deal with some of these challenges (Lam et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2009), e.g., by combin-ing phonetic similarity and a dictionary. However, arbitrary translations still cannot be handled by examining the NE pair itself. Corpus-based approaches (Kupiec, 1993; Feng, 2004), by mining external signals from a large corpus, such as parenthetical translation “成龙 (Jackie Chan)”, complement the problem of transliteration-based approaches, but the coverage of this approach is limited to popular entities with such evidence.","The most effective known approach to NE translation has been a holistic framework (You et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011; You et al., 2012) combining transliteration- and corpus-based methods. In these approaches, both 1) arbitrary translations and 2) lesser-known entities can be handled, by propagating the translation scores of known entities to lesser-known entities if they co-occur frequently in both corpora. For example, a lesser-known entity Tom Watson can be translated if Mandelson and Tom Watson co-occur frequently in an English corpus, and their Chinese translations also co-occur frequently in a Chinese corpus, i.e., if the co-occurrences in the two corpora are “symmetric”.","A research question we ask in this paper is: What if comparable corpora are not comparable enough to support this symmetry assumption? We found that this is indeed the case. For example, even English and Chinese news from the same publisher may have different focus– the Chinese version focuses more on Chinese Olympic 631 teams and Chinese local news. In the presence of such asymmetry, all previous approaches, building upon symmetry, quickly deteriorate by propagating false positives. For example, co-occurrence of Mandelson and Tom Watson may not appear in a Chinese corpus, which may lead to the translation of Tom Watson into another Chinese entity Gordon Brown which happens to co-occur with the Chinese translation of Mandelson.","Our key contribution is to avoid such false propagation, by discerning the semantics of relations. For example, relations between Mandelson and Tom Watson, should be semantically different from Chinese relations between ‘ 戈登·布朗’ (Gordon Brown) and ‘ 曼德尔森’ (Mandelson). A naive approach would be finding documents with a similar topic such as politics, and scientific discovery, and allowing propagation only when the topic agrees. However, we found that a topic is a unit that is too coarse for this task because most articles on Mandelson will invariably fall into the same topic1",". In clear contrast, we selectively propagate seed translations, only when the relations in the two corpora share the same semantics.","This selective propagation can be especially effective for translating challenging types of entities such as organizations including the WTO used with and without abbreviation in both languages. Applying a holistic approach (You et al., 2012) on organizations leads to poor results, 0.06 in terms of the F1-score. A naive approach to in-crease the precision would be to consider multi-type co-occurrences, hoping that highly precise translations of some type, e.g., persons with an F1-score of 0.69 (You et al., 2012), can be propagated to boost the precision on organizations. In our experiments, this naive multi-type propagation still leads to an unsatisfactory F1-score of 0.12. Such a low score can be explained by the following example. When translating ‘WTO’ using the co-occurrence with ‘Mandelson’, other co-occurrences such as (London, Mandelson) and (EU, Mandelson) produce a lot of noise because the right translation of WTO does not share much phonetic/semantic similarity. Our understanding of relation semantics, can distinguish “Mandelson was born in London” from “Mandelson visited the WTO”, to stop false propagations, which generates an F1-score 0.25 higher than the existing ap-1 The MRR for organization names achieved by a topic","model-based approach was 0.15 lower than our best. proaches.","More formally, we enable selective propagation of seed translations on weakly comparable corpora, by 1) clarifying the detailed meaning of relational information of co-occurring entities, and 2) identifying the contexts of the relational information using statement-level context comparison. In other words, we propagate the translation score of a known translation pair to a neighbor pair if the semantics of their relations in English and Chinese corpora are equivalent to accurately propagate the scores. For example, if we know ‘Russia’ →‘ 俄罗 斯’ (1) and join→加入(2), then from a pair of statements “Russia(1) joins(2) the WTO(3)” and “俄罗斯(1) 加入(2) 世贸组织(3)”, we can propagate the translation score of (Russia, 俄罗 斯)(1) to (WTO, 世 贸组织)(3). However, we do not exploit a pair of statements “Russia joined the WTO” and “俄罗斯 谴责(2’) 摩洛哥” because 谴责(2’) does not mean join(2). Furthermore, we mine a similar English-Chinese document pair that can be found by comparing the entity relationships, such as “Mandelson visited Moscow” and “Mandelson met Alexei Kudrin”, within the English document and the Chinese document to leverage similar contexts to assure that we use symmetric parts.","For this goal, we first extract relations among entities in documents, such as visit and join, and mine semantically equivalent relations across the languages, e.g., English and Chinese, such as join→加入. Once these relation translations are mined, similar document pairs can be identified by comparing each constituent relationship among entities using their relations. Knowing document similarity improves NE translation, and improved NE translation can boost the accuracy of document and relationship similarity. This iterative process can continue until convergence.","To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to translate a broad range of multilingual relations and exploit them to enhance NE translation. In particular, our approach leverages semantically similar document pairs to exclude incomparable parts that appear in one language only. Our method outperforms the previous approaches in translating NE up to 0.16 in terms of the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) for organization names. Moreover, our method shows robustness, with 0.14 higher MRR than seed translations, on less comparable corpora. 632"]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["This work is related to two research streams: NE translation and semantically equivalent relation mining. Entity translation Existing approaches on NE translation can be categorized into 1) transliteration-based, 2) corpus-based, and 3) hybrid approaches.","Transliteration-based approaches (Wan and Verspoor, 1998; Knight and Graehl, 1998) are the foundations of many decent methods, but they alone suffer from ambiguity (e.g., 史 蒂 夫 and 始第夫 have the same sounds) and cannot handle non-transliterated cases such as ‘Jackie Chan (成龙[ChengLong])’. Some methods (Lam et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2009) rely on meanings of constituent letters or words to handle organization name translation such as ‘Bank of China ( 中 国 银行)’, whose translation is derived from ‘China (中 国)’, and ‘a bank ( 银 行)’. However, many names often originate from abbreviation (such as ‘WTO’); hence we cannot always leverage meanings.","Corpus-based approaches (Kupiec, 1993; Lin et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2009) exploit high-quality bilingual evidence such as parenthetical translation, e.g., “成龙 (Jackie Chan)”, (Lin et al., 2008), semi-structural patterns (Jiang et al., 2009), and parallel corpus (Kupiec, 1993). However, the coverage of the corpus-based approaches is limited to popular entities with such bilingual evidences. On the other hand, our method can cover entities with monolingual occurrences in corpora, which significantly improves the coverage.","The most effective known approach is a holistic framework that combines those two approaches (You et al., 2012; You et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011). You et al. (2010; 2012) leverage two graphs of entities in each language, that are generated from a pair of corpora, with edge weights quantified as the strength of the relatedness of entities. Then, two graphs are iteratively aligned using the common neighbors of two entities. Kim et al. (2011) build such graphs using the context similarity, measured with a bag of words approach, of entities in news corpora to translate NEs. However, these approaches assume the symmetry of the two graphs. This assumption holds if two corpora are parallel, but such resources are scarce. But our approach exploits comparable parts from corpora. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0 10 20 30 40 50 N o r m a l i z e d  O c c u r r e n c e Weeks WTO  Figure 1: Dissimilarity of temporal distributions of ‘WTO’ in English and Chinese corpora.","Other interesting approaches such as (Klementiev and Roth, 2006; Kim et al., 2012) rely on temporal distributions of entities. That is, two entities are considered to be similar if the two entities in different languages have similar occurrence distributions over time. However, the effectiveness of this feature also depends on the comparability of entity occurrences in time-stamped corpora, which may not hold as shown in Figure 1. In clear contrast, our method can find and compare articles, on different dates, describing the same NE. More-over, our method does not require time stamps. Semantically similar relation mining Recently, similar relation mining in one language has been studied actively as a key part of automatic knowledge base construction. In automatically constructed knowledge bases, finding semantically similar relations can improve understanding of the Web describing content with many different expressions. As such an effort, PATTY (Nakashole et al., 2012) finds similar relations with almost the same support sets–the sets of NE pairs that co-occur with the relations. However, because of the regional locality of information, bilingual corpora contain many NE pairs that appear in only one of the support sets of the semantically identical relations. NELL (Mohamed et al., 2011) finds related relations using seed pairs of one given relation; then, using K-means clustering, it finds relations that are semantically similar to the given relation. Unfortunately, this method requires that we set K manually, and extract relations for each given relation. Therefore, this is unsuitable to support general relations.","There are only few works on translating relations or obtaining multi-lingual similar relations. Schone et al. (2011) try to find relation patterns 633 in multiple languages for given seed pairs of a relation. Because this approach finds seed pairs in Wikipedia infoboxes, the number of retrievable relations is restricted to five. Kim et al. (2010) seek more diverse types of relations, but it requires parallel corpora, which are scarce."]},{"title":"3 Framework Overview","paragraphs":["In this section, we provide an overview of our framework for translating NEs, using news corpora in English and Chinese as a running example.

First, we explain how we extract statements, which are units of relational information, from documents in Section 4.1, and how we obtain seed name translations in Section 4.2. Next, we present our method for discovering relation translations across languages in Section 4.3. In Section 4.4, we use the name translations and the relation translations to compare document contexts which can boost the precision of NE translation. In Section 4.5, we describe how we use the resources obtained so far to improve NE translation. 4.1 Statement Extraction We extract relational statements, which we exploit to propagate translation scores, from an English news corpus and a Chinese news corpus. A relational statement, or simply a statement is a triple (x, r, y), representing a relationship between two names, x and y. For example, from “Mandelson recently visited Moscow,” we obtain this statement: (Mandelson, visit, Moscow). We follow a standard procedure to extract statements, as similarly adopted by Nakashole et al. (2012), using Stanford CoreNLP (Klein and Manning, 2003) to lemmatize and parse sentences. Here, we refer readers to existing work for further details because this is not our key contribution. 4.2 Seed Entity Translation We need a few seed translation pairs to initiate the framework. We build a seed translation score T","(1)","N (eE, eC ) indicating the similarity of an English entity eE and a Chinese entity eC using an existing method. For example, most methods would give high value for 634 T (1) N (Mandelson, 曼德尔森 [ManDeErSen]). In this work, we adopted (You et al., 2012) with (Lam et al., 2007) as a base translation matrix to build the seed translation function. We also use a dictionary to obtain non-NE translations such as ‘government’. We use an English-Chinese general word dictionary containing approximately 80,000 English-Chinese translation word pairs that was also used by Kim et al. (2011) to measure the similarity of context words of entities. 4.3 Relation Translation We need to identify relations that have the equivalent semantics across languages, (e.g., visit→访 问), to enable selective propagation of translation scores. Formally, our goal is to measure a pairwise relation translation score TR(rE, rC ) for an English relation rE ∈ RE and a Chinese relation rC ∈ RC where RE is a set of all English relations and RC is a set of all Chinese relations.","We first explain a basic feature to measure the similarity of two relations, its limitations, and how we address the problems. A basic clue is that relations of the same meaning are likely to be mentioned with the same entity pairs. For example, if we have (Mandelson, visit, Moscow) as well as (Mandelson, head to, Moscow) in the corpus, this is a positive signal that the two relations may share the same meaning. Such NE pairs are called support pairs of the two relations.","We formally define this clue for relations in the same language, and then describe that in the bilingual setting. A support intersection Hm(ri",", rj","), a set of support pairs, for monolingual relations ri and rj","is defined as","Hm(ri",", rj",") = H(ri",") ∩ H(rj",") (1) where H(r) is the support set of a relation r defined as H(r) = {(x, y)|(x, r, y) ∈ S}, and S is either SE, a set of all English statements, or SC , a set of all Chinese statements that we extracted in Section 4.1.","Likewise, we can define a support intersection for relations in the different languages using the translation score TN (eE, eC ). For an English relation rE and a Chinese relation rC , Hb(rE, rC ) ={(xE, xC , yE, yC )| TN (xE, xC ) ≥ θ and TN (yE, yC ) ≥ θ for (xE, rE, yE) ∈ SE and (xC , rC , yC ) ∈ SC } (2) where θ = 0.6 is a harsh threshold to exclude most of the false translations by TN .","Finally, we define a support intersection, a set of support pairs between two relations ri","and rj","of any languages,","H(ri , rj",") =   ","Hb(ri , rj ) if ri","∈ R","E and rj ∈ R C","Hb(rj , ri ) if rj","∈ R","E and ri ∈ R C","Hm(ri , rj",") otherwise","(3)","Intuitively, |H(ri",", rj",")| indicates the strength of the semantic similarity of two relations ri","and rj","of any languages. However, as shown in Table 2, we cannot use this value directly to measure the similarity because the support intersection of semantically similar bilingual relations (e.g., |H(head to, 访问)| = 2) is generally very low, and normalization cannot remedy this problem as we can see from |H(visit, 访问)| = 27 and |H(visit)| = 1617.

Edges indicate that the relations have a non-empty support intersection, and edge labels show the size of the intersection.","We found that the connectivity among similar relations is more important than the strength of the similarity.

To exploit this feature, we use a random walk-based graph clustering method.","Formally, we use Markov clustering (Van Dongen, 2000) on a graph G = (V, E) of relations, where V = RE ∪ RC is a set of all English and Chinese relations. An edge (ri",", rj",") indicates that two relations in any languages are similar, and its weight is quantified by a sigmoid function on a linear transformation of |H(ri",", rj",")| that was empirically found to produce good results.","Each resultant cluster forms a set of bilingual similar relations, c = {rc1",", ..., rcM","}, such as visit-cluster, which consists of visit, head to, and 访问 in Figure 4. However, this cluster may not contain all similar relations. A relation may have multiple meanings (e.g., call on) so it can be clustered to another cluster, or a relation might not be clustered when its support set is too small (e.g., fly to). For such relations, rather than assigning zero similarity to visit-relations, we compute a cluster membership function based on support pairs of the cluster members and the target relation, and then formulate a pairwise relation translation score.","Formally, we learn the membership function of a relation r to a cluster c using support vector regression (Joachims, 1999) with the following features based on the support set of cluster c, H(c) = ⋃","r∈c H(r), and the support intersection","of r and c, H(r, c) = ⋃","r∗ ∈c H(r, r∗",").","• f 1","(r, c) = |H(r, c)|/|H(r)|: This quantifies the degree of inclusion, H(c) ∈ H(r).","• f 2","(r, c) = |H(r, c)|/|H(c)|: This quantifies the degree of inclusion, H(r) ∈ H(c).","• f 3 (r, c) = |H","within(r, c)|/|Hwithin(c)|: This is a","variation of f 2","that considers only noun phrase","pairs shared at least once by relations in c.","• f 4 (r, c) = |H","within(r, c)|/|Hshared(c)|: This is a","variation of f 2","that considers only noun phrase","pairs shared at least once by any pair of relations.","• f 5 (r, c) = |{r∗","∈ c|H(r, r∗",") > 0}|/|c|: This is the degree of connectivity to the cluster members. where Hwithin(r, c) = ⋃","r∗","∈c H(r, c) ∩ H(r, r∗","),","the intersection, considering translation, of H(r)","and noun phrase pairs shared at once by rela-","tions in c, Hwithin(c) =","⋃","r∗ ∈c H(r∗",", c − {r∗","}), and Hshared(c) = ⋃","r∗","∈RE∪RC H(r∗",", c), the noun phrase pairs shared at once by any relations. The use of Hwithin and Hshared is based on the observation that a noun phrase pair that appear in only one relation tends to be an incorrectly chunked entity such as ‘World Trade’ from the ‘World Trade Organization’.","Based on this membership function S(r, c), we compute pairwise relation similarity. We consider that two relations are similar if they have at least one cluster that the both relations belong to, which can be measured with S(r, c). More formally, pairwise similarity of relations ri","and rj","is defined as","TR(ri , rj ) = max","c∈C","S(ri , c) · S(rj",", c) (4) where C is a set of all clusters.","4.4 Statement-level Document Context Comparison A brute-force statement matching approach often fails due to ambiguity created by ignoring context, and missing information in TN or TR. Therefore, we detect similar document pairs to boost the statement matching process. Unlike the previous approaches (e.g., bag-of-words), we focus on the relationships of entities within documents using the extracted statements.","Formally, we compute the similarity of two statements sE = (xE, rE, yE) and sC = (xC , rC , yC ) in different languages as follows: TS(sE, sC ) = TN (xE, xC )TR(rE, rC )TN (yE, yC )","(5) With this definition, we can find similar statements described with different vocabularies in different languages.","To compare a document pair, we use the following equation to measure the similarity of an 636","English document di E and a Chinese document d j C","based on their statements Si E and S j C , respectively:","TD(di E, d j C ) =","∑ (sE,sC)∈B TS(s i,r E , s j,r C )","|Si E| + |Si","E| − |B| (6)","where B ⊂ Si E ×S j C is a greedy approximate solu-","tion of maximum bipartite matching (West, 1999)","on a bipartite graph GB = (VB = (Si","E, S","j","C ), EB)","with edge weights that are defined by TS. The","maximum bipartite matching finds a subset of","edges in Si","E × S","j","C that maximize the sum of the","selected edge weights and that do not share a node","as their anchor point. 4.5 Iteration on TN In this section, we describe how we use the statement similarity function TS, and the document similarity function TD to improve and derive the next generation entity translation function T","(t+1)","N . We consider that a pair of an English entity eE and a Chinese entity eC are likely to indicate the same real world entity if they have 1) semantically similar relations to the same entity 2) under the same context. Formally, we define an increment function as follows. ∆TN (eE, eC)= ∑ di E ∑ dj C","TD(di , dj ) max","(sE,sC)∈B∗ TS(sE, sC ) (7)","where B∗ is a subset of B ⊂ Si","E ×S","j","C such that the","connected statements mention eE and eC , and B is","the greedy approximate solution of maximum bi-","partite matching for the set Si E of statements of di","E and the set S","j","C of statements of dj","C . In other words,","B∗","is a set of matching statement pairs mention-","ing the translation target eE and eC in the docu-","ment pair.

We set λ = 0.6 in our experiments.","With this update, we obtain the improved NE translations considering the relations that an entity has to other entities under the same context to achieve higher precision."]},{"title":"5 Experiments","paragraphs":["In this section, we present experimental settings and results of translating entity names using our methods compared with several baselines. 5.1 Data and Evaluation We processed news articles for an entire year in 2008 by Xinhua news who publishes news in both English and Chinese, which were also used by Kim et al. (2011) and Shao and Ng (2004). The English corpus consists of 100,746 news articles, and the Chinese corpus consists of 88,031 news articles.

Both articles describe the same event about the visit of Mandelson to Moscow for the discussion on the joining of Russia to the WTO. The extracted statements are the exact translations of each corresponding part as indicated by the arrows. We stress this is an extreme case for illustration, where the two sentences are almost an exact translation, except for a minor asymmetry involving the date (Thursday in English, and 14th in Chinese). In most similar documents, the asymmetry is more significant. The seed translation score T 1","N (WTO, 世贸组织) is not enough to match the entities. However, the context similarity, due to other similar statements such as (1), allows us to match (2). This match helps translation of ‘WTO’ by inspecting the organization that Russia considers to join in both documents."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions","paragraphs":["This paper proposed a bootstrapping approach for entity translation using multilingual relational clustering.
