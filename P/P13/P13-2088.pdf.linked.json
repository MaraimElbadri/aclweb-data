With the explosion of social media, this has become easier and more prevalent than ever. Mining these troves of unstructured text has become a very active area of research with lots of applications. Sentiment Classification is among the most studied tasks for processing opinions (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2010). In its basic form, it involves classifying a piece of opinion, e.g. a movie or book review, into either having a positive or negative sentiment. Another form involves predicting the actual rating of a review, e.g. predicting the number of stars on a scale from 1 to 5 stars.","Most of the current research has focused on building sentiment analysis applications for the English language (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2010; Korayem et al., 2012), with much less work on other languages. In particular, there has been little work on sentiment analysis in Arabic (Abbasi et al., 2008; Abdul-Mageed et al., 2011; Abdul-Mageed et al., 2012; Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012b; Korayem et al., 2012), and very few, considerably small-sized, datasets to work with (Rushdi-Saleh et al., 2011b; Rushdi-Saleh et al., 2011a; Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012a; Elarnaoty et al., 2012). In this work, we try to address the lack of large-scale Arabic sentiment analysis datasets in this field, in the hope of sparking more interest in research in Arabic sentiment analysis and related tasks. Towards this end, we introduce LABR, the Large-scale Arabic Book Review dataset. It is a set of over 63K book reviews, each with a rating of 1 to 5 stars.","We make the following contributions: (1) We present the largest Arabic sentiment analysis dataset to-date (up to our knowledge); (2) We provide standard splits for the dataset into training and testing sets. This will make comparing different results much easier. The dataset and the splits are publicly available at www.mohamedaly.info/datasets; (3) We explore the structure and properties of the dataset, and per-form baseline experiments for two tasks: sentiment polarity classification and rating classification."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["A few Arabic sentiment analysis datasets have been collected in the past couple of years, we mention the relevant two sets:","OCA Opinion Corpus for Arabic (Rushdi-Saleh et al., 2011b) contains 500 movie reviews in Arabic, collected from forums and websites. It is divided into 250 positive and 250 negative reviews, although the division is not standard in that there is no rating for neutral reviews i.e. for 10-star rating systems, ratings above and including 5 are considered positive and those below 5 are considered negative.","AWATIF is a multi-genre corpus for Modern Standard Arabic sentiment analysis (Abdul-494 Number of reviews 63,257","Number of users 16,486 Avg. reviews per user 3.84 Median reviews per user 2","Number of books 2,131 Avg. reviews per book 29.68 Median reviews per book 6 Median tokens per review 33 Max tokens per review 3,736 Avg. tokens per review 65 Number of tokens 4,134,853 Number of sentences 342,199 Table 1: Important Dataset Statistics.","1 2 3 4 5","Rating 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 Number of reviews 2,939 5,285 12,201 19,054 23,778 Figure 1: Reviews Histogram.

It consists of about 2855 sentences of news wire stories, 5342 sentences from Wikipedia talk pages, and 2532 threaded conversations from web forums."]},{"title":"3 Dataset Collection","paragraphs":["We downloaded over 220,000 reviews from the book readers social network www.goodreads.com during the month of March 2013. These reviews were from the first 2143 books in the list of Best Arabic Books. After harvesting the reviews, we found out that over 70% of them were not in Arabic, either because some non-Arabic books exist in the list, or because of existing translations of some of the books in other languages. After filtering out the non-Arabic reviews, and performing several pre-processing steps to clean up HTML tags and other unwanted content, we ended up with 63,257 Arabic reviews."]},{"title":"4 Dataset Properties","paragraphs":["The dataset contains 63,257 reviews that were submitted by 16,486 users for 2,131 different books.

B stands for balanced, and U stands for Unbalanced. Table 1 contains some important facts about the dataset and Fig. 1 shows the number of reviews for each rating. We consider as positive reviews those with ratings 4 or 5, and negative reviews those with ratings 1 or 2. Reviews with rating 3 are considered neutral and not included in the polarity classification. The number of positive reviews is much larger than that of negative reviews. We believe this is because the books we got reviews for were the most popular books, and the top rated ones had many more reviews than the the least popular books.","The average user provided 3.84 reviews with the median being 2. The average book got almost 30 reviews with the median being 6. Fig. 2 shows the number of reviews per user and book. As shown in the Fig. 2c, most books and users have few reviews, and vice versa. Figures 2a-b show a box plot of the number of reviews per user and book. We notice that books (and users) tend to have (give) positive reviews than negative reviews, where the median number of positive reviews per book is 5 while that for negative reviews is only 2 (and similarly for reviews per user).","Fig. 3 shows the statistics of tokens and sentences. The reviews were tokenized and “ rough” sentence counts were computed (by looking for punctuation characters). The average number of tokens per review is 65.4, the average number of sentences per review is 5.4, and the average number of tokens per sentence is 12. Figures 3a-b show that the distribution is similar for positive and negative reviews. Fig. 3c shows a plot of the frequency of the tokens in the vocabulary in a loglog scale, which conforms to Zipf’s law (Manning and Schütze, 2000)."]},{"title":"5 Experiments","paragraphs":["We explored using the dataset for two tasks: (a) Sentiment polarity classification: where the goal is to predict if the review is positive i.e. with rating 4 or 5, or is negative i.e. with rating 1 or 2; and (b) 495 All Pos Neg 1 10 100 #reviews / user (a) Users All Pos Neg 1 10 100 1000 #reviews / book (b) Books","100","101 102","103","104 # reviews 100 101 102 103 104 # of users/books (c) Number of users/books Users Books Figure 2: Users and Books Statistics.

We do this because we already have enough training data, so there is no need to resort to cross-validation (Pang et al., 2002). To avoid the bias of having more positive than negative reviews, we explored two settings: (a) a balanced split where the number of reviews from every class is the same, and is taken to be the size of the smallest class (where larger classes are down-sampled); (b) an unbalanced split where the number of reviews from every class is unrestricted, and follows the distribution shown in Fig. 1. Table 2 shows the number of reviews in the training and test sets for each of the two tasks for the balanced and unbalanced splits, while Fig. 4 shows the breakdown of these numbers per class.","Tables 3-4 show results of the experiments for both tasks in both balanced/unbalanced settings. We tried different features: unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams with/without tf-idf weighting. For classifiers, we used Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes (for binary counts), and Support Vector Machines. We report two measures: the total classification accuracy (percentage of correctly classified test examples) andweighted F1 measure (Manning and Schütze, 2000). All experiments were implemented in Python using scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) and Qalsadi (available at pypi.python.org/pypi/qalsadi).","We notice that: (a) The total accuracy and weighted F1 are quite correlated and go hand-in-hand.

We explored its properties and statistics, provided standard splits, and performed several baseline experiments to establish a benchmark. Although we used very simple features and classifiers, task 1 achieved quite good results (~90% accuracy) but there is much room for improvement in task 2 (~50% accuracy). We plan next to work more on the dataset to get sentence-level polarity labels, and to extract Arabic sentiment lexicon and explore its potential. Furthermore, we also plan to explore using Arabic-specific and more powerful features. 497"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Ahmed Abbasi, Hsinchun Chen, and Arab Salem. 2008.
