Basically, PAS agrees much better between two languages than syntax structure (Fung et al., 2006; Wu and Fung, 2009b). Considering that current syntax-based translation models are always impaired by cross-lingual structure divergence (Eisner, 2003; Zhang et al., 2010), PAS is really a better representation of a sentence pair to model the bilingual structure mapping.","However, since a source-side PAS might correspond to multiple different target-side PASs, there usually exist many PAS ambiguities during translation. For example, in Figure 1, (a) and (b) carry the same source-side PAS <[A0]1 [Pred(是)]2 [A1]3> for Chinese predicate “是”. However, in Figure 1(a), the corresponding target-side-like PAS is <[X1] [X2] [X3]>, while in Figure 1(b), the counterpart target-side-like PAS","1"," is <[X2] [X3] [X1]>. This is because the two PASs play different roles in their corresponding sentences. Actually, Figure 1(a) is an independ-ent PAS, while Figure 1(b) is a modifier of the noun phrase “中国 和 俄罗斯”. We call this kind of PAS ambiguity role ambiguity. 中国 和 俄罗斯 两个 大国是 [ A0 ]1 [ A1 ]3[Pred]2 , being , should ...two major countries[ X3 ][X2] China and Russia[ X1 ] 应 ... 防洪 首要 的 任务是 [ A0 ]1 [ A1 ]3[Pred]2 flood prevention is the primary mission[ X1 ] [ X2 ] [ X3 ] 奥运村 的 位置 对 运动员 是 最 好 的 [ A0 ]1 [ A1 ]3[Pred]2 the location of the olympic village for athletesis the best[ X3 ][X2][ X1 ] (a) (c) (b)  Figure 1. An example of ambiguous PASs.","Meanwhile, Figure 1 also depicts another kind of PAS ambiguity. From Figure 1, we can see that (a) and (c) get the same source-side PAS and target-side-like PAS. However, they are different because in Figure 1(c), there is a gap string “对 运动员” between [A0] and [Pred]. Generally, the gap strings are due to the low recall of automatic semantic role labeling (SRL) or complex sentence structures. For example, in Figure 1(c), the gap string “对 运动员” is actually an argument “AM-PRP” of the PAS, but the SRL system has 1 We use target-side-like PAS to refer to a list of general non-terminals in target language order, where a nonterminal aligns to a source argument. 1127 ignored it. We call this kind of PAS ambiguity gap ambiguity.","During translation, these PAS ambiguities will greatly affect the PAS-based translation models. Therefore, in order to incorporate the bilingual PAS into machine translation effectively, we need to decide which target-side-like PAS should be chosen for a specific source-side PAS. We call this task PAS disambiguation.","In this paper, we propose two novel methods to incorporate rich context information to handle PAS ambiguities. Towards the gap ambiguity, we adopt a method called inside context integration to extend PAS to IC-PAS. In terms of IC-PAS, the gap strings are combined effectively to deal with the gap ambiguities. As to the role ambiguity, we design a novel maximum entropy PAS disambiguation (MEPD) model to combine various context features, such as context words of PAS. For each ambiguous source-side PAS, we build a specific MEPD model to select appropriate target-side-like PAS for translation. We will detail the two methods in Section 3 and 4 respectively.","Finally, we integrate the above two methods into a PAS-based translation framework (Zhai et al. 2012). Experiments show that the two PAS disambiguation methods significantly improve the baseline translation system. The main contribution of this work can be concluded as follows:","1) We define two kinds of PAS ambiguities: role ambiguity and gap ambiguity. To our best knowledge, we are the first to handle these PAS ambiguities for SMT.","2) Towards the two different ambiguities, we design two specific methods for PAS disambiguation: inside context integration and the novel MEPD model."]},{"title":"2 PAS-based Translation Framework","paragraphs":["PAS-based translation framework is to perform translation based on PAS transformation (Zhai et al., 2012). In the framework, a source-side PAS is first converted into target-side-like PASs by PAS transformation rules, and then perform translation based on the obtained target-side-like PASs. 2.1 PAS Transformation Rules PAS transformation rules (PASTR) are used to convert a source-side PAS into a target one. Formally, a PASTR is a triple <Pred, SP, TP>:"," Pred means the predicate where the rule is extracted."," SP denotes the list of source elements in source language order."," TP refers to the target-side-like PAS, i.e., a list of general non-terminals in target language order.","For example, Figure 2 shows the PASTR extracted from Figure 1(a). In this PASTR, Pred is Chinese verb “是”, SP is the source element list <[A0]1 [Pred]2 [A1]3>, and TP is the list of non-terminals <X1 X2 X3>. The same subscript in SP and TP means a one-to-one mapping between a source element and a target non-terminal. Here, we utilize the source element to refer to the predicate or argument of the source-side PAS. [X3] [X2] [A0]1 [Pred]2 [A1]3 [X1] source-side PAS(是) target-side-like PAS  Figure 2. An example PASTR. 2.2 PAS Decoding The PAS decoding process is divided into 3 steps:","(1) PAS acquisition: perform semantic role labeling (SRL) on the input sentences to achieve their PASs, i.e., source-side PASs;","(2) Transformation: use the PASTR to match the source-side PAS i.e., the predicate Pred and the source element list SP. Then by the matching PASTRs, transform source-side PASs to target-side-like PASs.","(3) Translation: in this step, the decoder first translates each source element respectively, and then a CKY-style decoding algorithm is adopted to combine the translation of each element and get the final translation of the PAS.","2.3 Sentence Decoding with the PAS-based translation framework Sometimes, the source sentence cannot be fully covered by the PAS, especially when there are several predicates. Thus to translate the whole sentence, Zhai et al. (2012) further designed an algorithm to decode the entire sentence.","In the algorithm, they organized the space of translation candidates into a hypergraph. For the span covered by PAS (PAS span), a multiple-branch hyperedge is employed to connect it to the PAS’s elements. For the span not covered by PAS (non-PAS span), the decoder considers all the possible binary segmentations of it and utilizes binary hyperedges to link them. 1128","During translation, the decoder fills the spans with translation candidates in a bottom-up manner. For the PAS span, the PAS-based translation framework is adopted. Otherwise, the BTG system (Xiong et al., 2006) is used. When the span covers the whole sentence, we get the final translation result.","","Obviously, PAS ambiguities are not considered in this framework at all. The target-side-like PAS is selected only according to the language model and translation probabilities, without considering any context information of PAS. Consequently, it would be difficult for the decoder to distinguish the source-side PAS from different context. This harms the translation quality. Thus to overcome this problem, we design two novel methods to cope with the PAS ambiguities: inside-context integration and a maximum entropy PAS disambiguation (MEPD) model. They will be detailed in the next two sections."]},{"title":"3 Inside Context Integration","paragraphs":["In this section, we integrate the inside context of the PAS into PASTRs to do PAS disambiguation. Basically, a PAS consists of several elements (a predicate and several arguments), which are actually a series of continuous spans. For a specific PAS <E1,..., En>, such as the source-side PAS <[A0][Pred][A1]> in Figure 2, its controlled range is defined as: ( ) { ( ), [1, ]}irange PAS s E i n= ∀∈ where s(Ei) denotes the span of element Ei. Further, we define the closure range of a PAS. It refers to the shortest continuous span covered by the entire PAS:","0() ()_ min , max","njsE jsEclosure range j j ∈∈","=   Here, E0 and En are the leftmost and rightmost element of the PAS respectively. The closure range is introduced here because adjacent source elements in a PAS are usually separated by gap strings in the sentence. We call these gap strings the inside context (IC) of the PAS, which satisfy: _ () (() ())closure range PAS IC PAS range PAS= ⊕  The operator ⊕ takes a list of neighboring spans as input","2",", and returns their combined continuous span. As an example, towards the PAS “<[A0] [Pred][A1]>” (the one for Chinese predicate “是 (shi)”) in Figure 3, its controlled range is {[3,5],[8,8],[9,11]} and its closure range is [3,11]. The IC of the PAS is thus {[6,7]}.","To consider the PAS’s IC during PAS transformation process, we incorporate its IC into the extracted PASTR. For each gap string in IC, we abstract it by the sequence of highest node categories (named as s-tag sequence). The s-tag sequence dominates the corresponding syntactic tree fragments in the parse tree. For example, in Figure 3, the s-tag sequence for span [6,8] is “PP VC”. Thus, the sequence for the IC (span [6,7]) in Figure 3 is “PP”. We combine the s-tag sequences with elements of the PAS in order. The resulting PAS is called IC-PAS, just like the left side of Figure 4(b) shows.

The illustration of inside context (IC). The subscript in each word refers to its position in sentence.","Differently, Zhai et al. (2012) attached the IC to its neighboring elements based on parse trees. For example, in Figure 3, they would attach the gap string “对(dui) 运动员(yun-dong-yuan)” to the PAS’s element “Pred”, and then the span of “Pred” would become [6,8]. Consequently, the span [6,8] will be translated as a whole source element in the decoder. This results in a bad translation because the gap string “对(dui) 运动员 (yun-dong-yuan)” and predicate “是(shi)” should be translated separately, just as Figure 4(a) shows. Therefore, we can see that the attachment decision in (Zhai et al., 2012) is sometimes unreasonable and the IC also cannot be used for PAS disambiguation at all. In contrast, our meth-2 Here, two spans are neighboring means that the beginning of the latter span is the former span’s subsequent word in the sentence.

We demand that every element and its corresponding target span must be consistent with word alignment. Otherwise, we discard the IC-PAS. Afterwards, we can easily extract a rule for PAS transformation, which we call IC-PASTR. As an example, Figure 4(b) is the extracted IC-PASTR from Figure 4(a).","Note that we only apply the source-side PAS and word alignment for IC-PASTR extraction. By contrast, Zhai et al. (2012) utilized the result of bilingual SRL (Zhuang and Zong, 2010b). Generally, bilingual SRL could give a better alignment between bilingual elements. However, bilingual SRL usually achieves a really low recall on PASs, about 226,968 entries in our training set while it is 882,702 by using monolingual SRL system. Thus to get a high recall for PASs, we only utilize word alignment instead of captur-ing the relation between bilingual elements. In addition, to guarantee the accuracy of IC-PASTRs, we only retain rules with more than 5 occurrences."]},{"title":"4 Maximum Entropy PAS Disambigua-tion (MEPD) Model","paragraphs":["In order to handle the role ambiguities, in this section, we concentrate on utilizing a maximum entropy model to incorporate the context information for PAS disambiguation. Actually, the disambiguation problem can be considered as a multi-class classification task. That is to say, for a source-side PAS, every corresponding target-side-like PAS can be considered as a label. For example, in Figure 1, for the source-side PAS “[A0]1[Pred]2[A1]3”, the target-side-like PAS “[X1] [X2] [X3]” in Figure 1(a) is thus a label and “[X2] [X3] [X1]” in Figure 1(b) is another label of this classification problem.","The maximum entropy model is the classical way to handle this problem: exp( ( , , ( ), ( ))) ( | , ( ), ( )) exp( ( , , ( ), ( ))) i ii tp i i i h sp tp c sp c tp","P tp sp c sp c tp h sp tp c sp c tpθ θ θ′="]},{"title":"∑ ∑∑ ","paragraphs":["where sp and tp refer to the source-side PAS (not including the predicate) and the target-side-like PAS respectively. c(sp) and c(tp) denote the surrounding context of sp and tp. hi is a binary feature function and θi is the weight of hi.","We train a maximum entropy classifier for each sp via the off-the-shelf MaxEnt toolkit 3",". Note that to avoid sparseness, sp does not include predicate of the PAS. Practically, the predicate serves as a feature of the MEPD model. As an example, for the rule illustrated in Figure 4(b), we build a MEPD model for its source element list sp <[A0] [PP] [Pred] [A1]>, and integrate the predicate “是(shi)” into the MEPD model as a feature.","In detail, we design a list of features for each pair <sp, tp> as follows:  Lexical Features. These features include the words immediately to the left and right of sp, represented as w-1 and w+1. Moreover, the head word of each argument also serves as a lexical feature, named as hw(Ei). For example, Figure 3 shows the context of the IC-PASTR in Figure 4(b), and the extracted lexical features of the in-stance are: w-1= , , w+1= 。 , hw([A0]1)= 位置 (wei-zhi), hw([A1]4)=好(hao).  POS Features. These features are defined as the POS tags of the lexical features, p-1, p+1 and phw(Ei) respectively. Thus, the corresponding POS features of Figure 4 (b) are: p-1=PU, p+1=PU, phw([A0]1)=NN, phw([A1]4)=VA.  Predicate Feature. It is the pair of source predicate and its corresponding target predicate. For example, in Figure 4(b), the source and target predicate are “是(shi)” and “is” respectively. The predicate feature is thus “PredF=是(shi)+is”.

The utilized lexical translation probabilities are from the toolkit in Moses (Koehn et al., 2007).  Syntax Features. These features include st(Ei), i.e., the highest syntax tag for each argument, and fst(PAS) which is the lowest father node of sp in the parse tree. For example, for the rule shown in Figure 4(b), syntax features are st([A0]1)=NP, st([A1]4)=CP, and fst(PAS)=IP respectively.","Using these features, we can train the MEPD model. We set the Gaussian prior to 1.0 and perform 100 iterations of the L-BFGS algorithm for each MEPD model. At last, we build 160 and 215 different MEPD classifiers, respectively, for the PASTRs and IC-PASTRs.

We use “IC-PASTR” to denote this system. In addition, since our method of rule extraction is different from (Zhai et al., 2012), we also use PASTR to construct a translation system as the baseline system, which we call “PASTR”.","On the basis of PASTR and IC-PASTR, we further integrate our MEPD model into translation. Specifically, we take the score of the MEPD model as another informative feature for the decoder to distinguish good target-side-like PASs from bad ones. The weights of the MEPD feature can be tuned by MERT (Och, 2003) together with other translation features, such as language model."]},{"title":"6 Related Work","paragraphs":["The method of PAS disambiguation for SMT is relevant to the previous work on context depend-4 The only difference between IC-PASTR and PASTR is that there are many syntactic labels in IC-PASTRs. ent translation.","Carpuat and Wu (2007a, 2007b) and Chan et al.

The translation quality is evaluated by case-insensitive BLEU-4 with shortest length penalty. The statistical significance test is performed by the re-sampling approach (Koehn, 2004).","We perform SRL on the source part of the training set, development set and test set by the Chinese SRL system used in (Zhuang and Zong, 2010b). To relieve the negative effect of SRL errors, we get the multiple SRL results by providing the SRL system with 3-best parse trees of Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007), 1-best parse tree of Bikel parser (Bikel, 2004) and Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003). Therefore, at last, we can get 5 SRL result for each sentence. For the training set, we use these SRL results to do rule extraction respectively. We combine the obtained rules together to get a combined rule set. We discard the rules with fewer than 5 appearances. Using this set, we can train our MEPD model directly.","As to translation, we match the 5 SRL results with transformation rules respectively, and then apply the resulting target-side-like PASs for decoding.

Moreover, according to our statistics, among all PASs appearing in the development set and test set, 56.7% of them carry gap strings. These statistics demonstrate the importance of handling the role ambiguity and gap ambiguity in the PAS-based translation framework. Therefore, we believe that our PAS disambiguation method would be helpful for translation. 7.3 Translation Result We compare the translation result using PASTR, IC-PASTR and our MEPD model in this section. The final translation results are shown in Table 2. As we can see, after employing PAS for translation, all systems outperform the baseline BTG system significantly.

These comparisons indicate that both the inside context integration and our MEPD model are beneficial for the decoder to choose better target-side-like PAS for translation.","On the basis of IC-PASTR, we further add our MEPD model into translation and get system IC-PASTR+MEPD.

We will explore the reason in section 7.5.","7.4 Effectiveness of Inside Context Integra-tion The method of inside context integration is used to combine the inside context (gap strings) into PAS for translation, i.e., extend the PASTR to IC-PASTR. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of inside context integration, we first give Table 3, which illustrates statistics on the matching PASs. The statistics are conducted on the combination of development set and test set.","Transformation Rules","Matching PAS","None Gap PAS Gap PAS Total","PASTR 1702 1539 3241","IC-PASTR 1546 832 2378 Table 3.

Among these matching PASs, 1539 ones (column “Gap PAS”) carry gap strings, while 1702 ones do not (column “None Gap PAS”). Consequently, since PASTR does not consider the inside context during translation, the Gap PASs, which account for 47% (1539/3241) of all matching PASs, might be handled inappropriately in the PAS-based translation framework. Therefore, integrating the inside context into PASTRs, i.e., using the proposed IC-PASTRs, would be helpful for translation. The translation result shown in Table 2 also demonstrates this conclusion.

Translation examples to verify the effectiveness of inside context.","From Table 3, we can also find that the number of matching PASs decreases after using IC-PASTR. This is because IC-PASTR is more specific than PASTR. Therefore, for a PAS with specific inside context (gap strings), even if the matched PASTR is available, the matched IC-PASTR might not. This indicates that comparing with PASTR, IC-PASTR is more capable of distinguishing different PASs. Therefore, based on this advantage, although the number of matching PASs decreases, IC-PASTR still improves the translation system using PASTR significantly. Of course, we believe that it is also possible to integrate the inside context without decreasing the number of matching PASs and we plan this as our future work.","We further give a translation example in Figure 5 to illustrate the effectiveness of our inside context integration method. In the example, the automatic SRL system ignores the long preposition phrase “对 经济复苏 、尤其是 恢复 投资信 心” for the PAS. Thus, the system using PASTRs can only attach the long phrase to the predicate “是” according to the parse tree, and meanwhile, make use of a transformation rule as follows: [X3] [X2] [A0]1 [Pred]2 [A1]3 [X1] source-side PAS(是) target-side-like PAS  In this way, the translation result is very bad, just as Figure 5(b) shows. The long preposition phrases are wrongly positioned in the translation.","In contrast, after inside context integration, we match the inside context during PAS transformation. As Figure 5(c) shows, the inside context helps to selects a right transformation rule as follows and gets a good translation result finally.

On the basis of PASTR and IC-PASTR, we build 160 and 215 different MEPD classifies, respectively, for the frequent source-side PASs.","In Table 2, we have found that our MEPD model improves system IC-PASTR slightly. We conjecture that this phenomenon is due to two possible reasons. On one hand, sometimes, many PAS ambiguities might be resolved by both inside context and the MEPD model. Therefore, the improvement would not be such significant 1133 when we combine these two methods together. On the other hand, as Table 3 shows, the number of matching PASs decreases after using IC-PASTR. Since the MEPD model works on PASs, its effectiveness would also weaken to some extent. Future work will explore this phenomenon more thoroughly. PASTR Ref PASTR + MEPD ... , [海牙]A0 [是]Pred [其 最后 一站]A1 。 ... [the hague] [is] [the last leg] . ... , [海牙] [是] [其 最后 一站] 。 ...

Translation examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our MEPD model.","Now, we give Figure 6 to demonstrate the effectiveness of our MEPD model. From the Figure, we can see that the system using PASTRs selects an inappropriate transformation rule for translation: [X1] [X3] [A0]1 [Pred]2 [A1]3 [X2] source-side PAS(是) target-side-like PAS"," This rule wrongly moves the subject “ 海牙 (Hague)” to the end of the translation. We do not give the translation result of the BTG system here because it makes the same mistake.","Conversely, by considering the context information, the PASTR+MEPD system chooses a correct rule for translation: [X3] [X2] [A0]1 [Pred]2 [A1]3 [X1] source-side PAS(是) target-side-like PAS"," As we can see, the used rule helps to keep the SVO structure unchanged, and gets the correct translation."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper, we focus on the problem of ambiguities for PASs. We first propose two ambiguities: gap ambiguity and role ambiguity. Accordingly, we design two novel methods to do efficient PAS disambiguation: inside-context integration and a novel MEPD model. For inside context integration, we abstract the inside context and combine them into the PASTRs for PAS transformation. Towards the MEPD model, we design a maximum entropy model for each ambitious source-side PASs. The two methods successfully incorporate the rich context information into the translation process. Experiments show that our PAS disambiguation methods help to improve the translation performance significantly.","In the next step, we will conduct experiments on other language pairs to demonstrate the effectiveness of our PAS disambiguation method. In addition, we also will try to explore more useful and representative features for our MEPD model."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The research work has been funded by the Hi-Tech Research and Development Program (“863” Program) of China under Grant No. 2011AA01A207, 2012AA011101, and 2012AA011102 and also supported by the Key Project of Knowledge Innovation Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant No.KGZD-EW-501.
