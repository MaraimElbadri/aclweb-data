Our target audience are researchers and practitioners in language technology, not necessarily experts in MWEs, who are interested in tasks that involve or could benefit from considering MWEs as a pervasive phenomenon in human language and communication."]},{"title":"2 Topic Overview","paragraphs":["Multiword expressions (MWEs) like break down, bus stop and make ends meet, are expressions consisting of two or more lexical units that correspond to some conventional way of saying things (Sag et al., 2001). They range over linguistic constructions such as fixed phrases (per se, by and large), noun compounds (telephone booth, cable car), compound verbs (give a presentation), idioms (a frog in the throat, kill some time), etc. They are also widely known as collocations, for the frequent co-occurrence of their components (Manning and Schütze, 2001).","From a natural language processing perspective, the interest in MWEs comes from the very important role they play forming a large part of human language, which involves the use of linguistic routines or prefabricated sequences in any kind of text or speech, from the terminology of a specific domain (parietal cortex, substantia nigra, splice up) to the more colloquial vocabulary (freak out, make out, mess up) and the language of the social media (hash tag, fail whale, blackbird pie). New MWEs are constantly being introduced in the language (cloud services, social networking site, security apps), and knowing how they are used reflects the ability to successfully understand and generate language.","While easily mastered by native speakers, their treatment and interpretation involves considerable effort for computational systems (and nonnative speakers), due to their idiosyncratic, flexible and heterogeneous nature (Rayson et al., 2010; Ramisch et al., to appear). First of all, there is the task of identifying whether a given sequence of words is an MWE or not (e.g. give a gift vs. a presentation) (Pecina, 2008; Green et al., 2013; Seretan, 2012). For a given MWE, there is also the problem of determining whether it forms a compositional (take away the dishes), semi-idiomatic (boil up the beans) or idiomatic combination (roll up your sleeves) (Kim and Nakov, 2011; Shutova et al., 2013). Furthermore, MWEs may also be polysemous: bring up as carrying (bring up the bags), raising (bring up the children) and mentioning (bring up the subject). Unfortunately, solutions that are successfully employed for treating similar problems in the context of simplex works may not be adequate for MWEs, given the complex interactions between their component words (e.g. the idiomatic use of spill in spilling beans as revealing secrets vs. its literal usage in spilling lentils)."]},{"title":"3 Content Overview","paragraphs":["This tutorial consists of four parts. Part I starts with a thorough introduction to different types of MWEs and collocations, their linguistic dimensions (idiomaticity, syntactic and semantic fixedness, specificity, etc.), as well as their statistical characteristics (variability, recurrence, association, etc.). This part concludes with an overview of linguistic and psycholinguistic theories of MWEs to date.","For MWEs to be useful for language technology, they must be recognisable automatically. 7 Hence, Part II surveys computational approaches for MWEs recognition, both manually-authored approaches and using machine learning techniques, and for modeling syntactic and semantic variability. We will also review token identification and disambiguation of MWEs in context (e.g. bus stop in Does the bus stop here? vs. The bus stop is here) and methods for the automatic detection of the degree of compositionality of MWEs and their interpretation. Part II finishes with a discussion of evaluation for MWE tasks.","Part III of the tutorial describes resources made available for a wide range of languages as well as MWE-related multi-level annotation platforms and examples of where MWEs treatment can contribute to language technology tasks and applications such as parsing, word sense disambiguation, machine translation, information extraction and information retrieval. Part IV concludes with a list of future possibilities and open challenges in the computational treatment of MWEs in current NLP models and techniques."]},{"title":"4 Tutorial Outline","paragraphs":["1.
