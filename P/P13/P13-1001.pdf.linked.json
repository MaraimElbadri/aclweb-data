Phrase-based approaches treat phrase, which is usually a sequence of consecutive words, as the basic unit of translation (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004). As phrases are capable of memorizing local context, phrase-based approaches excel at handling local word selection and reordering. In addition, it is straightforward to integrate n-gram language models into phrase-based decoders in which translation always grows left-to-right. As a result, phrase-based decoders only need to maintain the boundary words on one end to calculate language model probabilities. However, as phrase-based decoding usually casts translation as a string concatenation problem and permits arbitrary permutation, it proves to be NP-complete (Knight, 1999).","Syntax-based approaches, on the other hand, model the hierarchical structure of natural languages (Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005; Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008; Zhang et al., 2008). As syntactic information can be exploited to provide linguistically-motivated reordering rules, predicting non-local permutation is computationally tractable in syntax-based approaches. Unfortunately, as syntax-based decoders often generate target-language words in a bottom-up way using the CKY algorithm, integrating n-gram language models becomes more expensive because they have to maintain target boundary words at both ends of a partial translation (Chiang, 2007; Huang and Chiang, 2007). Moreover, syntax-based approaches often suffer from the rule coverage problem since syntactic constraints rule out a large portion of non-syntactic phrase pairs, which might help decoders generalize well to unseen data (Marcu et al., 2006). Furthermore, the introduction of non-terminals makes the grammar size significantly bigger than phrase tables and leads to higher memory requirement (Chiang, 2007).","As a result, incremental decoding with hierarchical structures has attracted increasing attention in recent years. While some authors try to integrate syntax into phrase-based decoding (Galley and Manning, 2008; Galley and Manning, 2009; Feng et al., 2010), others develop incremental algorithms for syntax-based models (Watanabe et al., 2006; Huang and Mi, 2010; Dyer and Resnik, 2010; Feng et al., 2012). Despite these successful efforts, challenges still remain for both directions. While parsing algorithms can be used to parse partial translations in phrase-based decoding, the search space is significantly enlarged since there are exponentially many parse trees for exponentially many translations. On the other hand, although target words can be generated left-to-right by altering the way of tree transversal in syntax-based models, it is still difficult to reach full rule coverage as compared with phrase table. 1 zongtong jiang yu siyue lai lundun fangwen The President will visit London in April","source phrase target phrase dependency category r1 fangwen visit {} fixed r2 yu siyue in April {1 → 2} fixed r3 zongtong jiang The President will {2 → 1} floating left r4 yu siyue lai lundun London in April {2 → 3} floating right r5 zongtong jiang President will {} ill-formed Figure 1: A training example consisting of a (romanized) Chinese sentence, an English dependency tree, and the word alignment between them. Each translation rule is composed of a source phrase, a target phrase with a set of dependency arcs. Following Shen et al. (2008), we distinguish between fixed, floating, and ill-formed structures.","In this paper, we propose a shift-reduce parsing algorithm for phrase-based string-to-dependency translation. The basic unit of translation in our model is string-to-dependency phrase pair, which consists of a phrase on the source side and a dependency structure on the target side. The algorithm generates well-formed dependency structures for partial translations left-to-right using string-to-dependency phrase pairs. Therefore, our approach is capable of combining the advantages of both phrase-based and syntax-based approaches:","1. compact rule table: our rule table is a subset of the original string-to-dependency grammar (Shen et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2010) by excluding rules with non-terminals.","2. full rule coverage: all phrase pairs, both syntactic and non-syntactic, can be used in our algorithm. This is the same with Moses (Koehn et al., 2007).","3. efficient integration of n-gram language model: as translation grows left-to-right in our algorithm, integrating n-gram language models is straightforward.","4. exploiting syntactic information: as the shift-reduce parsing algorithm generates target language dependency trees in decoding, dependency language models (Shen et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2010) can be used to encourage linguistically-motivated reordering.","5. resolving local parsing ambiguity: as dependency trees for phrases are memorized in rules, our approach avoids resolving local parsing ambiguity and explores in a smaller search space than parsing word-by-word on the fly in decoding (Galley and Manning, 2009).","We evaluate our method on the NIST Chinese-English translation datasets. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms both phrase-based (Koehn et al., 2007) and string-to-dependency approaches (Shen et al., 2008) in terms of BLEU and TER."]},{"title":"2 Shift-Reduce Parsing for Phrase-based String-to-Dependency Translation","paragraphs":["Figure 1 shows a training example consisting of a (romanized) Chinese sentence, an English dependency tree, and the word alignment between them. Following Shen et al. (2008), string-to-dependency rules without non-terminals can be extracted from the training example. As shown in Figure 1, each rule is composed of a source phrase and a target dependency structure. Shen et al. (2008) divide dependency structures into two broad categories: 1. well-formed (a) fixed: the head is known or fixed; 2 0 ◦ ◦ ◦ ◦ ◦ ◦ ◦ 1 S r3 [The President will] • • ◦ ◦ ◦ ◦ ◦ 2 S r1 [The President will] [visit] • • ◦ ◦ ◦ ◦ • 3 Rl [The President will visit] • • ◦ ◦ ◦ ◦ • 4 S r4 [The President will visit] [London in April] • • • • • • • 5 Rr [The President will visit London in April] • • • • • • • step action rule stack coverage Figure 2: Shift-reduce parsing with string-to-dependency phrase pairs. For each state, the algorithm maintains a stack to store items (i.e., well-formed dependency structures). At each step, it chooses one action to extend a state: shift (S), reduce left (Rl), or reduce right (Rr). The decoding process terminates when all source words are covered and there is a complete dependency tree in the stack.","(b) floating: sibling nodes of a common head, but the head itself is unspecified or floating. Each of the siblings must be a complete constituent. 2. ill-formed: neither fixed nor floating.","We further distinguish between left and right floating structures according to the position of head. For example, as “The President will” is the left dependant of its head “visit”, it is a left floating structure.","To integrate the advantages of phrase-based and string-to-dependency models, we propose a shift-reduce algorithm for phrase-based string-to-dependency translation.","Figure 2 shows an example. We describe a state (i.e., parser configuration) as a tuple ⟨S, C⟩ where S is a stack that stores items and C is a coverage vector that indicates which source words have been translated. Each item s ∈ S is a well-formed dependency structure. The algorithm starts with an empty state. At each step, it chooses one of the three actions (Huang et al., 2009) to extend a state:","1. shift (S): move a target dependency structure onto the stack;","2. reduce left (Rl): combine the two items on the stack, st and st−1 (t ≥ 2), with the root of st as the head and replace them with a combined item;","3. reduce right (Rr): combine the two items on the stack, st and st−1 (t ≥ 2), with the root of st−1 as the head and replace them with a combined item. The decoding process terminates when all source words are covered and there is a complete dependency tree in the stack.","Note that unlike monolingual shift-reduce parsers (Nivre, 2004; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Huang et al., 2009), our algorithm does not maintain a queue for remaining words of the input because the future dependency structure to be shifted is unknown in advance in the translation scenario. Instead, we use a coverage vector on the source side to determine when to terminate the algorithm.","For an input sentence of J words, the number of actions is 2K − 1, where K is the number of rules used in decoding. 1","There are always K shifts and","1","Empirically, we find that the average number of stacks for J words is about 1.5 × J on the Chinese-English data. 3 [The President] [will] [visit] [The President] [will] [visit] [London] [The President] [will] [visit London] [The President] [will visit London] [The President] [will visit] [The President will visit] [The President will visit] [London] [The President will visit London] S Rr Rl Rl Rl Rl S Rr Figure 3: Ambiguity in shift-reduce parsing. st−1 st legal action(s)","yes S","h yes S","l yes S","r no h h yes S, Rl, Rr h l yes S h r yes Rr l h yes Rl l l yes S l r no r h no r l no r r no Table 1: Conflicts in shift-reduce parsing. st and st−1 are the top two items in the stack of a state.

They suffice to operate on well-formed structures and produce projective dependency parse trees.","Therefore, with dependency structures present in the stacks, it is possible to use dependency language models to encourage linguistically plausible phrase reordering."]},{"title":"3 A Maximum Entropy Based Shift-Reduce Parsing Model","paragraphs":["Shift-reduce parsing is efficient but suffers from parsing errors caused by syntactic ambiguity. Figure 3 shows two (partial) derivations for a dependency tree. Consider the item on the top, the algorithm can either apply a shift action to move a new item or apply a reduce left action to obtain a bigger structure. This is often referred to as conflict in the shift-reduce dependency parsing literature (Huang et al., 2009). In this work, the shift-reduce parser faces four types of conflicts: 1. shift vs. shift; 2. shift vs. reduce left; 3. shift vs. reduce right; 4. reduce left vs. reduce right.","Fortunately, if we distinguish between left and right floating structures, it is possible to rule out most conflicts.

If the stack is empty, the only applicable action is shift. If there is only one item in the stack and the item is either fixed or left floating, the only applicable action is shift. Note that it is illegal to shift a right floating structure onto an empty stack because it will never be reduced. If the stack contains at least two items, only “h+h” is ambiguous and the others are either unambiguous or illegal. Therefore, we only need to focus on how to resolve conflicts for the “h+h” case (i.e., the top two items in a stack are both fixed structures).","We propose a maximum entropy model to resolve the conflicts for “h+h”: 2 Pθ(a|c, st, st−1) =","exp(θ · h(a, c, st, st−1)) ∑ a exp(θ · h(a, c, st, st−1)) where a ∈ {S, Rl, Rr} is an action, c is a boolean value that indicates whether all source words are covered (shift is prohibited if true), st and st−1 are the top two items on the stack, h(a, c, st, st−1) is a vector of binary features and θ is a vector of feature weights.","Figure 4 shows the feature templates used in our experiments.

In this example, c = true, Wh(st) = in, Th(st) = IN, Wh(st−1) = visit, Wlc(st−1) = London.","To train the model, we need an “oracle” or gold-standard action sequence for each training example. Unfortunately, such oracle turns out to be non-unique even for monolingual shift-reduce dependency parsing (Huang et al., 2009). The situation for phrase-based shift-reduce parsing aggravates because there are usually multiple ways of segmenting sentence into phrases.","To alleviate this problem, we introduce a structure called derivation graph to compactly represent all derivations of a training example. Figure 3 shows a (partial) derivation graph, in which a node corresponds to a state and an edge corresponds to an action. The graph begins with an empty state and ends with the given training example.","More formally, a derivation graph is a directed acyclic graph G = ⟨V, E⟩ where V is a set of nodes and E is a set of edges. Each node v corresponds to a state in the shift-reduce parsing process. There are two distinguished nodes: v0, the staring empty state, and v|V |, the ending completed state. Each edge e = (a, i, j) transits node vi to node vj via an action a ∈ {S, Rl, Rr}.","To build the derivation graph, our algorithm starts with an empty state and iteratively extends an unprocessed state until reaches the completed state. During the process, states that violate the training example are discarded. Even so, there are still exponentially many states for a training example, especially for long sentences.

As shown in Algorithm 1, the algorithm maintains a list of stacks V and each stack groups states with the same number of accumulated actions (line 2). The stack list V initializes with an empty state v0 (line 3). Then, the states in the stack are iteratively extended until there are no incomplete states (lines 4-12). The search space is constrained by discarding any state that has a score worse than:","1. β multiplied with the best score in the stack, or 2. the score of b-th best state in the stack.","As the stack of a state keeps changing during the decoding process, the context information needed to calculate dependency language model and maximum entropy model probabilities (e.g., root word, leftmost child, etc.) changes dynamically as well. As a result, the chance of risk-free hypothesis recombination (Koehn et al., 2003) significantly decreases because complicated contextual information is much less likely to be identical.","Therefore, we use hypergraph reranking (Huang and Chiang, 2007; Huang, 2008), which proves to be effective for integrating non-local features into dynamic programming, to alleviate this problem. The decoding process is divided into two passes. In the first pass, only standard features (i.e., features 1-7 in the list in the beginning of this section) are used to produce a hypergraph. 3","In the second pass, we use the hypergraph reranking algorithm (Huang, 2008) to find promising translations using additional dependency features (i.e., features 8-10 in the list). As hypergraph is capable of storing exponentially many derivations compactly, the negative effect of propagating mistakes made in the first pass to the second pass can be minimized.","To improve rule coverage, we follow Shen et al. (2008) to use ill-formed structures in decoding. If an ill-formed structure has a single root, it can treated as a (pseudo) fixed structure; otherwise it is transformed to one (pseudo) left floating structure and one (pseudo) right floating structure.

They introduce maximum spanning tree (MST) parsing (McDonald et al., 2005) into phrase-based translation. The system is phrase-based except that an MST parser runs to parse partial translations at the same time. One challenge is that MST parsing itself is not incremental, making it expensive to identify loops during hypothesis expansion. On the contrary, shift-reduce parsing is naturally incremental and can be seamlessly integrated into left-to-right phrase-based decoding. More importantly, in our work dependency trees are memorized for phrases rather than being generated word by word on the fly in decoding. This treatment might not only reduce decoding complexity but also potentially revolve local parsing ambiguity.","Our decoding algorithm is similar to Gimpel and Smith (2011)’s lattice parsing algorithm as we divide decoding into two steps: hypergraph generation and hypergraph rescoring. The major difference is that our hypergraph is not a phrasal lattice because each phrase pair is associated with a dependency structure on the target side. In other words, our second pass is to find the Viterbi derivation with addition features rather than parsing the phrasal lattice. In addition, their algorithm produces phrasal dependency parse trees while the leaves of our dependency trees are words, making dependency language models can be directly used.","Shift-reduce parsing has been successfully used in phrase-based decoding but limited to adding structural constraints.
