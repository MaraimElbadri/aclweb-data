These systems learn user requirements through spoken or text-based dialog, asking questions about particular attributes to filter the space of relevant documents.","Traditionally, these systems draw questions from a small, fixed set of attributes, such as cuisine or price in the restaurant domain. However, these systems overlook an important element in users’ interactions with online product listings: user-generated reviews. Huang et al. (2012) show that information extracted from user reviews greatly improves user experience in visual search interfaces. In this paper, we present a dialog-based interface that takes advantage of review texts. We demonstrate our system on a new challenge corpus of 11,537 businesses and 229,907 user reviews released by the popular review website Yelp1",", focusing on the dataset’s 4724 restaurants and bars (164,106 reviews).","This paper makes two main contributions. First, we describe and qualitatively evaluate a frame-","1","https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/ work for generating new, highly-relevant questions from user review texts. The framework makes use of techniques from topic modeling and sentiment-based aspect extraction to identify fine-grained attributes for each business. These attributes form the basis of a new set of questions that the system can ask the user.","Second, we use a method based on information-gain for dynamically ranking candidate questions during dialog production. This allows our system to select the most informative question at each dialog step. An evaluation based on simulated dialogs shows that both the ranking method and the automatically generated questions improve recall."]},{"title":"2 Generating Questions from Reviews 2.1 Subcategory Questions","paragraphs":["Yelp provides each business with category labels for top-level cuisine types like Japanese, Coffee & Tea, and Vegetarian. Many of these top-level categories have natural subcategories (e.g., ramen vs. sushi). By identifying these subcategories, we enable questions which probe one step deeper than the top-level category label.","To identify these subcategories, we run Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) on the reviews of each set of businesses in the twenty most common top-level categories, using 10 topics and concatenating all of a business’s reviews into one document.2","Several researchers have used sentence-level documents to model topics in reviews, but these tend to generate topics about fine-grained aspects of the sort we discuss in Section 2.2 (Jo and Oh, 2011; Brody and Elhadad, 2010). We then manually labeled the topics, discarding junk topics and merging similar topics. Table 1 displays sample extracted subcategories.","Using these topic models, we assign a business 2 We use the Topic Modeling Toolkit implementation:","http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tmt 499","Category Topic Label Top Words pizza crust sauce pizza garlic sausage slice salad","Italian traditional pasta sauce delicious ravioli veal dishes gnocchi bistro bruschetta patio salad valet delicious brie panini deli sandwich deli salad pasta delicious grocery meatball brew pub beers peaks ale brewery patio ipa brew grill steak salad delicious sliders ribs tots drinks bar drinks vig bartender patio uptown dive karaoke","American (New) bistro drinks pretzel salad fondue patio sanwich windsor brunch sandwich brunch salad delicious pancakes patio burger burger fries sauce beef potato sandwich delicious","mediterranean pita hummus jungle salad delicious mediterranean wrap italian deli sandwich meats cannoli cheeses authentic sausage new york deli beef sandwich pastrami corned fries waitress","Delis bagels bagel sandwiches toasted lox delicious donuts yummy","mediterranean pita lemonade falafel hummus delicious salad bakery sandwiches sandwich subs sauce beef tasty meats delicious sushi sushi kyoto zen rolls tuna sashimi spicy","Japanese teppanyaki sapporo chef teppanyaki sushi drinks shrimp fried teriyaki teriyaki sauce beef bowls veggies spicy grill ramen noodles udon dishes blossom delicious soup ramen Table 1: A sample of subcategory topics with hand-labels and top words. to a subcategory based on the topic with highest probability in that business’s topic distribution. Finally, we use these subcategory topics to generate questions for our recommender dialog system. Each top-level category corresponds to a single question whose potential answers are the set of subcategories: e.g., “What type of Japanese cuisine do you want?” 2.2 Questions from Fine-Grained Aspects Our second source for questions is based on aspect extraction in sentiment summarization (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008; Brody and Elhadad, 2010). We define an aspect as any noun-phrase which is targeted by a sentiment predicate. For example, from the sentence “The place had great atmosphere, but the service was slow.” we extract two aspects: +atmosphere and –service.","Our aspect extraction system has two steps. First we develop a domain specific sentiment lexicon. Second, we apply syntactic patterns to identify NPs targeted by these sentiment predicates. 2.2.1 Sentiment Lexicon Coordination Graph We generate a list of domain-specific sentiment adjectives using graph propagation. We begin with a seed set combin-ing PARADIGM+ (Jo and Oh, 2011) with ‘strongly subjective’ adjectives from the OpinionFinder lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005), yielding 1342 seeds. Like Brody and Elhadad (2010), we then construct a coordination graph that links adjectives modify-ing the same noun, but to increase precision we require that the adjectives also be conjoined by and (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997). This reduces problems like propagating positive sentiment to orange in good orange chicken. We marked adjectives that follow too or lie in the scope of negation with special prefixes and treated them as distinct lexical entries. Sentiment Propagation Negative and positive seeds are assigned values of 0 and 1 respectively. All other adjectives begin at 0.5. Then a standard propagation update is computed iteratively (see Eq. 3 of Brody and Elhadad (2010)).","In Brody and Elhadad’s implementation of this propagation method, seed sentiment values are fixed, and the update step is repeated until the non-seed values converge. We found that three modifications significantly improved precision. First, we omit candidate nodes that don’t link to at least two positive or two negative seeds. This eliminated spurious propagation caused by one-off parsing errors. Second, we run the propagation algorithm for fewer iterations (two iterations for negative terms and one for positive terms). We found that additional iterations led to significant error propagation when neutral (italian) or ambiguous (thick) terms were assigned sentiment.3","Third, we update both non-seed and seed adjectives. This allows us to learn, for example, that the negative seed decadent is positive in the restaurant domain.","Table 2 shows a sample of sentiment adjectives","3","Our results are consistent with the recent finding of Whitney and Sarkar (2012) that cautious systems are better when bootstrapping from seeds. 500 Negative Sentiment institutional, underwhelming, not nice, burntish, unidentifiable, inefficient, notattentive, grotesque, confused, trashy, insufferable, grandiose, not pleasant, timid, degrading, laughable, under-seasoned, dismayed, torn Positive Sentiment decadent, satisfied, lovely, stupendous, sizable, nutritious, intense, peaceful, not expensive, elegant, rustic, fast, affordable, efficient, congenial, rich, not too heavy, wholesome, bustling, lush Table 2: Sample of Learned Sentiment Adjectives derived by this graph propagation method. The final lexicon has 1329 adjectives4",", including 853 terms not in the original seed set. The lexicon is available for download.5 Evaluative Verbs In addition to this adjective lexicon, we take 56 evaluative verbs such as love and hate from admire-class VerbNet predicates (Kipper-Schuler, 2005). 2.2.2 Extraction Patterns To identify noun-phrases which are targeted by predicates in our sentiment lexicon, we develop hand-crafted extraction patterns defined over syntactic dependency parses (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009) generated by the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003). Table 3 shows a sample of the aspects generated by these methods. Adj + NP It is common practice to extract any NP modified by a sentiment adjective. However, this simple extraction rule suffers from precision problems. First, reviews often contain sentiment toward irrelevant, non-business targets (Wayne is the target of excellent job in (1)). Second, hypothetical contexts lead to spurious extractions. In (2), the extraction +service is clearly wrong–in fact, the opposite sentiment is being expressed.","(1) Wayne did an excellent job addressing our","needs and giving us our options.","(2) Nice and airy atmosphere, but service could be","more attentive at times. 4 We manually removed 26 spurious terms which were","caused by parsing errors or propagation to a neutral term. 5 http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/","yelp.shtml We address these problems by filtering out sentences in hypothetical contexts cued by if, should, could, or a question mark, and by adopting the following, more conservative extractions rules:","i) [BIZ + have + adj. + NP] Sentiment adjective modifies NP, main verb is have, subject is business name, it, they, place, or absent. (E.g., This place has some really great yogurt and toppings).","ii) [NP + be + adj.] Sentiment adjective linked to NP by be—e.g., Our pizza was much too jalapeno-y. “Good For” + NP Next, we extract aspects using the pattern BIZ + positive adj. + for + NP, as in It’s perfect for a date night. Examples of extracted aspects include +lunch, +large groups, +drinks, and +quick lunch. Verb + NP Finally, we extract NPs that appear as direct object to one of our evaluative verbs (e.g., We loved the fried chicken). 2.2.3 Aspects as Questions We generate questions from these extracted aspects using simple templates. For example, the aspect +burritos yields the question: Do you want a place with good burritos?"]},{"title":"3 Question Selection for Dialog","paragraphs":["To utilize the questions generated from reviews in recommendation dialogs, we first formalize the dialog optimization task and then offer a solution. 3.1 Problem Statement We consider a version of the Information Retrieval Dialog task introduced by Kopeček (1999). Businesses b ∈ B have associated attributes, coming from a set Att. These attributes are a combination of Yelp categories and our automatically extracted aspects described in Section 2. Attributes att ∈ Att take values in a finite domain dom(att). We denote the subset of businesses with an attribute att tak-ing value val ∈ dom(att), as B|att=val. Attributes are functions from businesses to subsets of values: att : B → P(dom(att)). We model a user information need I as a set of attribute/value pairs: I = {(att1, val1), . . . , (att|I|, val|I|)}.","Given a set of businesses and attributes, a recommendation agent π selects an attribute to ask 501","Chinese: Mexican: +beef +egg roll +sour soup +orange chicken +salsa bar +burritos +fish tacos +guacamole +noodles +crab puff +egg drop soup +enchiladas +hot sauce +carne asade +breakfast burritos +dim sum +fried rice +honey chicken +horchata +green salsa +tortillas +quesadillas","Japanese: American (New) +rolls +sushi rolls +wasabi +sushi bar +salmon +environment +drink menu +bar area +cocktails +brunch +chicken katsu +crunch +green tea +sake selection +hummus +mac and cheese +outdoor patio +seating area +oysters +drink menu +sushi selection +quality +lighting +brews +sangria +cheese plates Table 3: Sample of the most frequent positive aspects extracted from review texts.","Input: Information need I Set of businesses B Set of attributes Att Recommendation agent π Dialog length K","Output: Dialog history H Recommended businesses B","Initialize dialog history H = ∅","for step = 0; step < K; step++ do Select an attribute: att = π(B, H) Query user for the answer: val = I(att) Restrict set of businesses: B = B|att=val Append answer: H = H ∪ {(att, val)}","end","Return (H, B)","Algorithm 1: Procedure for evaluating a recom-","mendation agent the user about, then uses the answer value to narrow the set of businesses to those with the desired attribute value, and selects another query.

Thus, formally a recommendation agent is a func-tion π : B × H → Att. The dialog ends after a fixed number of queriesK. 3.2 Information Gain Agent The information gain recommendation agent chooses questions to ask the user by selecting question attributes that maximize the entropy of the resulting document set, in a manner similar to decision tree learning (Mitchell, 1997).

For instance, most businesses only have one or two top-level categories, so after the system has identified the top-level category that the user is interested in, it has no more good questions to ask. Note that the information gain agent starts dialogs with the top-level and appropriate subcategory questions, so it is only for longer dialogs that the fine-grained aspects boost performance.","Below we show a few sample output dialogs from our ‘All’ information gain agent.

Using topic models to discover subtypes of businesses, a domain-specific sentiment lexicon, and a number of new techniques for increasing precision in sentiment aspect extraction yields attributes that give a rich representation of the restaurant domain. We have made this 1329-term sentiment lexicon for the restaurant domain available as useful resource to the community. Our information gain recommendation agent gives a principled way to dynamically combine these diverse attributes to ask relevant questions in a coherent dialog. Our approach thus offers a new way to integrate the advantages of the curated hand-build attributes used in statistical slot and filler dialog systems, and the distributionally induced, highly relevant categories built by sentiment aspect extraction systems."]},{"title":"6 Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["Thanks to the anonymous reviewers and the Stanford NLP group for helpful suggestions.
