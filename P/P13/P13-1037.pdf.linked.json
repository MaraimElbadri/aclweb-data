By far the most notable exception to this is the line of work by Moldovan and Badulescu (Moldovan and Badulescu, 2005; Badulescu and Moldovan, 2009), who define a taxonomy of relations, annotate data, calculate inter-annotator agreement, and perform automatic classification experiments. Badulescu and Moldovan (2009) investigate both ’s-constructions and of constructions in the same context using a list of 36 semantic relations (including OTHER). They take their examples from a collection of 20,000 randomly selected sentences from Los Angeles Times news articles used in TREC-9. For the 960 extracted ’s-possessive examples, only 20 of their semantic relations are observed, including OTHER, with 8 of the observed relations occurring fewer than 10 times. They report a 0.82 Kappa agreement (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) for the two computational semantics graduates who annotate the data, stating that this strong result “can be explained by the instructions the annotators received 1 Possessive pronouns such as his and their are treated as","’s constructions in this work. 372 prior to annotation and by their expertise in Lexical Semantics.”","Moldovan and Badulescu experiment with several different classification techniques. They find that their semantic scattering technique significantly outperforms their comparison systems with its F-measure score of 78.75. Their SVM system performs the worst with only 23.25% accuracy— suprisingly low, especially considering that 220 of the 960 ’s examples have the same label.","Unfortunately, Badulescu and Moldovan (2009) have not publicly released their data2",". Also, it is sometimes difficult to understand the meaning of the semantic relations, partly because most relations are only described by a single example and, to a lesser extent, because the bulk of the given examples are of -constructions. For example, why President of Bolivia warrants a SOURCE/FROM relation but University of Texas is assigned to LOCATION/SPACE is unclear. Their relations and provided examples are presented below in Table 1.

Another 5,266 examples are from The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (Gibbon, 1776), a non-fiction work, and 1,342 are from The Jungle Book (Kipling, 1894), a collection of fictional short stories. For the Penn Treebank, we extracted the examples using the provided gold standard parse trees, whereas, for the latter cases, we used the output of an open source parser (Tratz and Hovy, 2011)."]},{"title":"4 Semantic Relation Inventory","paragraphs":["The initial semantic relation inventory for possessives was created by first examining some of the relevant literature on possessives, including work by Badulescu and Moldovan (2009), Barker (1995), Quirk et al. (1985), Rosenbach (2002), and Taylor (1996), and then manually annotating the large dataset of examples. Similar examples were grouped together to form initial categories, and groups that were considered more difficult were later reexamined in greater detail. Once all the examples were assigned to initial categories, the process of refining the definitions and annotations began.","In total, 17 relations were created, not including OTHER. They are shown in Table 3 along with approximate (best guess) mappings to relations defined by others, specifically those of Quirk et al.

Each set of examples was extracted such that no two examples had an identical possessee word. For a given example, annotators were instructed to select the most appropriate option but could also record a second-best choice to provide additional feedback. Figure 1 presents a screenshot of the HTML-based annotation interface. After the annotation was complete for a given round, agreement and entropy figures were calculated and changes were made to the relation definitions and dataset. The number of refinement rounds was arbitrarily limited to five. To measure agreement, in addition to calculating simple percentage agreement, we computed Fleiss’ Kappa (Fleiss, 1971), a measure of agreement that incorporates a correction for agreement due to chance, similar to Cohen’s Kappa (Cohen, 1960), but which can be used to measure agreement involving more than two annotations per item. The agreement and entropy figures for these five intermediate annotation rounds are given in Table 4. In all the possessive annotation tables, Annotator A refers to the primary author and the labels B and C refer to two additional annotators.","To calculate a final measure of inter-annotator agreement, we randomly drew 150 examples from the dataset not used in the previous refinement it-erations, with 50 examples coming from each of","Figure 1: Screenshot of the HTML template page used for annotation. the three original data sources. All three annotators initially agreed on 82 of the 150 examples, leaving 68 examples with at least some disagreement, including 17 for which all three annotators disagreed.","Annotators then engaged in a new task in which they re-annotated these 68 examples, in each case being able to select only from the definitions previously chosen for each example by at least one annotator. No indication of who or how many people had previously selected the definitions was 374 Figure 2: Semantic relation distribution for the dataset presented in this work.

Annotators were instructed not to choose a definition simply because they thought they had chosen it before or because they thought some-one else had chosen it. After the revision process, all three annotators agreed in 109 cases and all three disagreed in only 6 cases. During the revision process, Annotator A made 8 changes, B made 20 changes, and C made 33 changes. Annotator A likely made the fewest changes because he, as the primary author, spent a significant amount of time thinking about, writing, and re-writing the definitions used for the various iterations. Annotator C’s annotation work tended to be less consistent in general than Annotator B’s throughout this work as well as in a different task not discussed within this paper, which probably why Annotator C made more changes than Annotator B. Prior to this revision process, the three-way Fleiss’ Kappa score was 0.60 but, afterwards, it was at 0.78. The inter-annotator agreement and entropy figures for before and after this revision process, including pairwise scores between individual annotators, are presented in Tables 5 and 6. 4.2 Distribution of Relations The distribution of semantic relations varies somewhat by the data source.

The Penn Treebank and The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire were substantially more similar, although there are notable differences. For instance, the LOCATION and TEMPORAL relations almost never occur in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Whether these differences are due to variations in genre, time period, and/or other factors would be an interesting topic for future study. The distribution of relations for each data source is presented in Figure 2.","Though it is harder to compare across datasets using different annotation schemes, there are at least a couple notable differences between the distribution of relations for Badulescu and Moldovan’s (2009) dataset and the distribution of relations used in this work. One such difference is the much higher percentage of examples labeled as TEMPORAL—11.35% vs only 2.84% in our data. Another difference is a higher incidence of the KINSHIP relation (6.31% vs 3.39%), although it is far less frequent than it is in The Jungle Book (11.62%). 4.3 Encountered Ambiguities One of the problems with creating a list of relations expressed by ’s-constructions is that some examples can potentially fit into multiple categories. For example, Joe’s resentment encodes 375 both SUBJECTIVE relation and MENTAL EXPERIENCER relations and UK’s cities encodes both PARTITIVE and LOCATION relations. A representative list of these types of issues along with examples designed to illustrate them is presented in Table 7."]},{"title":"5 Experiments","paragraphs":["For the automatic classification experiments, we set aside 10% of the data for test purposes, and used the the remaining 90% for training. We used 5-fold cross-validation performed using the training data to tweak the included feature templates and optimize training parameters. 5.1 Learning Approach The LIBLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008) package was used to train linear Support Vector Machine (SVMs) for all the experiments in the one-against-the-rest style. All training parameters took their default values with the exception of the C parameter, which controls the tradeoff between margin width and training error and which was set to 0.02, the point of highest performance in the cross-validation tuning. 5.2 Feature Generation For feature generation, we conflated the possessive pronouns ‘his’, ‘her’, ‘my’, and ‘your’ to ‘person.’ Similarly, every term match-ing the case-insensitive regular expression (corp|co|plc|inc|ag|ltd|llc)\\\\.?) was replaced with the word ‘corporation.’","All the features used are functions of the following five words. • The possessor word • The possessee word • The syntactic governor of the possessee word • The set of words between the possessor and","possessee word (e.g., first in John’s first kiss) • The word to the right of the possessee The following feature templates are used to generate features from the above words.

The accuracy figures for the test instances from the Penn Treebank, The Jungle Book, and The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire were 88.8%, 84.7%, and 80.6%, respectively. The fact that the score for The Jungle Book was the lowest is somewhat surprising considering it contains a high percentage of body part and kinship terms, which tend to be straightforward, but this may be because the other sources comprise approximately 94% of the training examples.","Given that human agreement typically represents an upper bound on machine performance in classification tasks, the 87.4% accuracy figure may be somewhat surprising. One explanation is that the examples pulled out for the inter-annotator agreement study each had a unique possessee word. For example, “expectations”, as in “analyst’s expectations”, occurs 26 times as the possessee in the dataset, but, for the inter-annotator agreement study, at most one of these examples could be included. More importantly, when the initial relations were being defined, the data were first sorted based upon the possessee and then the possessor in order to create blocks of similar examples. Doing this allowed multiple examples to be assigned to a category more quickly because one can decide upon a category for the whole lot at once and then just extract the few, if any, that be-long to other categories.

Before each variation, the C parameter was retuned using 5-fold cross validation on the training data. The results for these runs are shown in Table 8.","Based upon the leave-one-out and only-one feature evaluation experiment results, it appears that the possessee word is more important to classification than the possessor word. The possessor word is still valuable though, with it likely being more 377 valuable for certain categories (e.g., TEMPORAL and LOCATION) than others (e.g., KINSHIP). Hypernym and gloss term features proved to be about equally valuable. Curiously, although hypernyms are commonly used as features in NLP classification tasks, gloss terms, which are rarely used for these tasks, are approximately as useful, at least in this particular context. This would be an interesting result to examine in greater detail."]},{"title":"6 Related Work 6.1 Linguistics","paragraphs":["Semantic relation inventories for the English ’s-construction have been around for some time; Taylor (1996) mentions a set of 6 relations enumerated by Poutsma (1914–1916). Curiously, there is not a single dominant semantic relation inventory for possessives. A representative example of semantic relation inventories for ’s-constructions is the one given by Quirk et al. (1985) (presented earlier in Section 2).","Interestingly, the set of relations expressed by possessives varies by language. For example, Classical Greek permits a standard of comparison relation (e.g., “better than Plato”) (Nikiforidou, 1991), and, in Japanese, some relations are expressed in the opposite direction (e.g., “blue eye’s doll”) while others are not (e.g., “Tanaka’s face”) (Nishiguchi, 2009).","To explain how and why such seemingly different relations as whole+part and cause+effect are expressed by the same linguistic phenomenon, Nikiforidou (1991) pursues an approach of metaphorical structuring in line with the work of Lakoff and Johnson (1980) and Lakoff (1987). She thus proposes a variety of such metaphors as THINGS THAT HAPPEN (TO US) ARE (OUR) POS-SESSIONS and CAUSES ARE ORIGINS to explain how the different relations expressed by possessives extend from one another.","Certainly, not all, or even most, of the linguistics literature on English possessives focuses on creating lists of semantic relations. Much of the work covering the semantics of the ’s construction in English, such as Barker’s (1995) work, dwells on the split between cases of relational nouns, such as sister, that, by their very definition, hold a specific relation to other real or conceptual things, and non-relational, or sortal nouns (Löbner, 1985), such as car.","Vikner and Jensen’s (2002) approach for handling these disparate cases is based upon Pustejovsky’s (1995) generative lexicon framework. They coerce sortal nouns (e.g., car) into being relational, purporting to create a uniform analysis. They split lexical possession into four types: inherent, part-whole, agentive, and control, with agentive and control encompassing many, if not most, of the cases involving sortal nouns.","A variety of other issues related to possessives considered by the linguistics literature include adjectival modifiers that significantly alter interpretation (e.g., favorite and former), double genitives (e.g., book of John’s), bare possessives (i.e., cases where the possessee is omitted, as in “Eat at Joe’s”), possessive compounds (e.g., driver’s license), the syntactic structure of possessives, definitiveness, changes over the course of his-tory, and differences between languages in terms of which relations may be expressed by the genitive. Representative work includes that by Barker (1995), Taylor (1996), Heine (1997), Partee and Borschev (1998), Rosenbach (2002), and Vikner and Jensen (2002). 6.2 Computational Linguistics Though the relation between nominals in the English possessive construction has received little attention from the NLP community, there is a large body of work that focuses on similar problems involving noun-noun relation interpretation/paraphrasing, including interpreting the relations between the components of noun compounds (Butnariu et al., 2010), disambiguating preposition senses (Litkowski and Hargraves, 2007), or annotating the relation between nominals in more arbitrary constructions within the same sentence (Hendrickx et al., 2009).","Whereas some of these lines of work use fixed inventories of semantic relations (Lauer, 1995; Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003; Kim and Baldwin, 2005; Girju, 2009; Ó Séaghdha and Copestake, 2009; Tratz and Hovy, 2010), other work allows for a nearly infinite number of interpretations (Butnariu and Veale, 2008; Nakov, 2008). Recent SemEval tasks (Butnariu et al., 2009; Hendrickx et al., 2013) pursue this more open-ended strategy. In these tasks, participating systems recover the implicit predicate between the nouns in noun compounds by creating potentially unique paraphrases for each example. For instance, a system might generate the paraphrase made of for the noun com-378 Feature Type Word(s) Results","L R C G B N LOO OO Gloss Terms ■ 0.867 (0.04) 0.762 (0.08) Hypernyms ■ 0.870 (0.04) 0.760 (0.16) Synonyms ■ 0.873 (0.04) 0.757 (0.32) Word Itself ■ 0.871 (0.04) 0.745 (0.08) Lexnames ■ 0.871 (0.04) 0.514 (0.32) Last Letters ■ 0.870 (0.04) 0.495 (0.64) Lexnames ■ 0.872 (0.04) 0.424 (0.08) Link types ■ 0.874 (0.02) 0.398 (0.64) Link types ■ 0.870 (0.04) 0.338 (0.32) Word Itself ■ 0.870 (0.04) 0.316 (0.16) Last Letters ■ 0.872 (0.02) 0.303 (0.16) Gloss Terms ■ 0.872 (0.02) 0.271 (0.04) Hypernyms ■ 0.875 (0.02) 0.269 (0.08) Word Itself ■ 0.874 (0.02) 0.261 (0.08) Synonyms ■ 0.874 (0.02) 0.260 (0.04) Lexnames ■ 0.874 (0.02) 0.247 (0.04) Part-of-speech List ■ 0.873 (0.02) 0.245 (0.16) Part-of-speech List ■ 0.874 (0.02) 0.243 (0.16) Dependency ■ 0.872 (0.02) 0.241 (0.16) Part-of-speech List ■ 0.874 (0.02) 0.236 (0.32) Link Types ■ 0.874 (0.02) 0.236 (0.64) Word Itself ■ 0.870 (0.02) 0.234 (0.32) Assigned Part-of-Speech ■ 0.874 (0.02) 0.228 (0.08) Affixes ■ 0.873 (0.02) 0.227 (0.16) Assigned Part-of-Speech ■ 0.873 (0.02) 0.194 (0.16) Hypernyms ■ 0.873 (0.02) 0.186 (0.04) Lexnames ■ 0.870 (0.04) 0.170 (0.64) Text of Dependents ■ 0.874 (0.02) 0.156 (0.08) Parts List ■ 0.873 (0.02) 0.141 (0.16) Affixes ■ 0.870 (0.04) 0.114 (0.32) Affixes ■ 0.873 (0.02) 0.105 (0.04) Parts List ■ 0.874 (0.02) 0.103 (0.16) Table 8: Results for leave-one-out and only-one feature template ablation experiment results for all feature templates sorted by the only-one case.

We explain our methodology for building this inventory and dataset and report a strong level of inter-annotator agreement, reaching 0.78 Kappa overall. The resulting dataset is quite large, at 21,938 instances, and crosses multiple domains, including news, fiction, and historical non-fiction. It is the only large fully-annotated publicly-available collection of possessive examples that we are aware of.
