We propose systems exploiting syntactic and semantic constraints to extract appositions from OntoNotes. Our joint log-linear model outperforms the state-of-the-art Favre and Hakkani-Tür (2009) model by ∼10% on Broadcast News, and achieves 54.3% F-score on multiple genres."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Appositions are typically adjacent coreferent noun phrases (NP) that often add information about named entities (NEs). The apposition in Figure 1 consists of three comma-separated NPs – the first NP (HEAD) names an entity and the others (ATTRs) supply age and profession attributes. Attributes can be difficult to identify despite characteristic punctuation cues, as punctuation plays many roles and attributes may have rich substructure.","While linguists have studied apposition in detail (Quirk et al., 1985; Meyer, 1992), most apposition extraction has been within other tasks, such as coreference resolution (Luo and Zitouni, 2005; Culotta et al., 2007) and textual entailment (Roth and Sammons, 2007). Extraction has rarely been intrinsically evaluated, with Favre and Hakkani-Tür’s work a notable exception.","We analyze apposition distribution in OntoNotes 4 (Pradhan et al., 2007) and compare rule-based, classification and parsing extraction systems. Our best system uses a joint model to classify pairs of NPs with features that faithfully encode syntactic and semantic restrictions on appositions, using parse trees and WordNet synsets. {John Ake}h , {48}a , {a former vice-president in charge of legal compliance at American Capital Management & Research Inc., in Houston,}a , . . .

Our results will immediately help the many systems that already use apposition extraction components, such as coreference resolution and IE."]},{"title":"2 Background","paragraphs":["Apposition is widely studied, but “grammarians vary in the freedom with which they apply the term ‘apposition”’ (Quirk et al., 1985). They are usually composed of two or more adjacent NPs, hierarchically structured, so one is the head NP (HEAD) and the rest attributes (ATTRs). They are often flagged using punctuation in text and pauses in speech. Pragmatically, they allow an author to introduce new information and build a shared con-text (Meyer, 1992).","Quirk et al. propose three tests for apposition: i) each phrase can be omitted without affecting sentence acceptability, ii) each fulfils the same syntactic function in the resultant sentences, iii) extralinguistic reference is unchanged. Strict interpretations may exclude other information-bearing cases like pseudo-titles (e.g. ({President}a {Bush}h)NP), but include some adverbial phrases (e.g. {(John Smith)NP}h, {(formerly (the president)NP)AP}a). We adopt the OntoNotes guidelines’ relatively strict interpretation: “a noun phrase that modifies an immediately-adjacent noun phrase (these may be separated by only a comma, colon, or parenthesis).” (BBN, 2004–2007). 671 Unit TRAINF DEVF TESTF TRAIN DEV TEST Sents. 9,595 976 1,098 48,762 6,894 6,896 Appos. 590 64 68 3,877 502 490 Table 1: Sentence and apposition distribution","Apposition extraction is a common component in many NLP tasks: coreference resolution (Luo and Zitouni, 2005; Culotta et al., 2007; Bengtson and Roth, 2008; Poon and Domingos, 2008), textual entailment (Roth and Sammons, 2007; Cabrio and Magnini, 2010), sentence simplification (Miwa et al., 2010; Candido et al., 2009; Siddharthan, 2002) and summarization (Nenkova et al., 2005). Comma ambiguity has been studied in the RTE (Srikumar et al., 2008) and generation domains (White and Rajkumar, 2008).","Despite this, few papers to our knowledge explicitly evaluate apposition extraction. Moreover, apposition extraction is rarely the main research goal and descriptions of the methods used are often accordingly terse or do not match our guidelines. Lee et al. (2011) use rules to extract appositions for coreference resolution, selecting only those that are explicitly flagged using commas or parentheses. They do not separately mark HEAD and ATTR and permit relative clauses as an ATTR. While such differences capture useful information for coreference resolution, these methods would be unfairly disadvantaged in a direct evaluation.","Favre and Hakkani-Tür (2009, FHT) directly evaluate three extraction systems on OntoNotes 2.9 news broadcasts. The first retrains the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) on trees labelled with appositions by appending the HEAD and ATTR suffix to NPs – we refer to this as a Labelled Berkeley Parser (LBP). The second is a CRF labelling words using an IOB apposition scheme. Token, POS, NE and BP-label features are used, as are presence of speech pauses. The final system classifies parse tree phrases using an Adaboost classifier (Schapire and Singer, 2000) with similar features.","The LBP, IOB and phrase systems score 41.38%, 32.76% and 40.41%, while their best uses LBP tree labels as IOB features, scoring 42.31%. Their focus on BN automated speech recognition (ASR) output, which precludes punctuation cues, does not indicate how well the methods perform on textual genres. Moreover all systems use parsers or parse-label features and do not completely evaluate non-parser methods for extraction despite in-cluding baselines.

We manually adjust appositions that do not have exactly one HEAD and one or more ATTR1",". Some appositions are nested, and we keep only “leaf” appositions, removing the higher-level appositions.","We follow the CoNLL-2011 scheme to select TRAIN, DEV and TEST datasets (Pradhan et al., 2011). OntoNotes 4 is made up of a wide variety of sources: broadcast conversation and news, magazine, newswire and web text. Appositions are most frequent in newswire (one per 192 words) and least common in broadcast conversation (one per 645 words) with the others in between (around one per 315 words).","We also replicate the OntoNotes 2.9 BN data used by FHT, selecting the same sentences from OntoNotes 4 (TRAINF/DEVF/TESTF). We do not “speechify” our data and take a different approach to nested apposition. Table 1 shows the distribution of sentences and appositions (HEAD-ATTR pairs). 3.1 Analysis Most appositions in TRAIN have one ATTR (97.4%) with few having two (2.5%) or three (0.1%). HEADs are typically shorter (median 5 tokens, 95% < 7) than ATTRs (median 7 tokens, 95% < 15). Table 2 shows frequent apposition forms. Comma-separated apposition is the most common (63%) and 93% are separated by zero or one token.

Our systems that use syntactic parses generate candidates (pairs of NPs: p1 and p2) that are then classified as apposition or not.","This paper contributes three complementary techniques for more faithfully modelling apposition. Any adjacent NPs, disregarding intervening punctuation, could be considered candidates, however stronger syntactic constraints that only allow sibling NP children provide higher precision candidate sets. Semantic compatibility features encoding that an ATTR provides consistent information for its HEAD. A joint classifier models the complete apposition rather than combining separate phrase-wise decisions. Taggers and parsers are trained on TRAIN and evaluated on DEV or TEST. We use the C&C tools (Curran and Clark, 2003) for POS and NE tagging and the and the Berkeley Parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007), trained with default parameters. Pattern POS, NE and lexical patterns are used to extract appositions avoiding parsing’s computational overhead. Rules are applied independently to tokenized and tagged sentences, yield-ing HEAD-ATTR tuples that are later deduplicated. The rules were manually derived from TRAIN2","and Table 3 shows the top five of sixteen rules by recall over TRAIN. The “role” gazetteer is the transitive closure of hyponyms of the WordNet (Miller, 1995) synset person.n.01 and “relation” manually constructed (e.g., “father”, “colleague”).

Adjacent NPs This low precision, high recall baseline assumes all candidates, depending on generation strategy, are appositions. Rule We only consider HEADs whose syntactic head is a PER, ORG, LOC or GPE NE. We formalise semantic compatibility by requiring the ATTR head to match a gazetteer dependent on the HEAD’s NE type. To create PER, ORG and LOC gazetteers, we identified common ATTR heads in TRAIN and looked for matching WordNet synsets, selecting the most general hypernym that was still semantically compatible with the HEAD’s NE type.","Gazetteer words are pluralized using pattern.en (De Smedt and Daelemans, 2012) and normalised. We use partitive and NML-aware rules (Collins, 1999; Vadas and Curran, 2007) to extract syntactic heads from ATTRs. These must match the type-appropriate gazetteer, with ORG and LOC/GPE falling back to PER (e.g., “the champion, Apple”).","Extracted tuples are post-processed as for Pattern and reranked by the OntoNotes specificity scale (i.e., NNP > PRO > Def. NP > Indef. NP > NP), and the more specific unit is assigned HEAD. Possible ATTRs further to the left or right are checked, allowing for cases such as Figure 1.

Our best system has an F-score of 58.9% using a joint model over the de-labelled trees produced by the LBP. This indicates that although our model does not use the apposition labels from the tree, the tree is a more suitable structure for extraction.

The F-score increase is driven by higher precision at minimal cost to recall. Removing semantic features has less impact and removing both is most detrimental to performance.

Goldstandard tags and trees improve recall in all cases leading to F-score improvements (+gold).
