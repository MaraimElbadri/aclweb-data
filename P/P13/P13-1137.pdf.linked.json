Consequently, automatically generated meeting summaries could be of great value to people and businesses alike by providing quick access to the essential content of past meetings. Focused meeting summaries have been proposed as particularly useful; in contrast to summaries of a meeting as a whole, they refer to summaries of a specific as-pect of a meeting, such as the DECISIONS reached, PROBLEMS discussed, PROGRESS made or AC-TION ITEMS that emerged (Carenini et al., 2011). Our goal is to provide an automatic summarization system that can generate abstract-style focused meeting summaries to help users digest the vast amount of meeting content in an easy manner.","Existing meeting summarization systems remain largely extractive: their summaries are comprised exclusively of patchworks of utterances selected directly from the meetings to be summarized (Riedhammer et al., 2010; Bui et al., 2009; Xie et al., 2008). Although relatively easy to construct, extractive approaches fall short of produc-ing concise and readable summaries, largely due C: Looking at what we’ve got, we we want an LCD display with a spinning wheel.

Also shown is the gold-standard (manual) abstract (summary) for the decision and the problem. to the noisy, fragmented, ungrammatical and un-structured text of meeting transcripts (Murray et al., 2010b; Liu and Liu, 2009).","In contrast, human-written meeting summaries are typically in the form of abstracts — distilla-tions of the original conversation written in new language. A user study from Murray et al. (2010b) showed that people demonstrate a strong prefer-ence for abstractive summaries over extracts when the text to be summarized is conversational. Consider, for example, the two types of focused summary along with their associated dialogue snippets in Figure 1. We can see that extracts are likely to include unnecessary and noisy information from the meeting transcripts. On the contrary, the manually composed summaries (abstracts) are more compact and readable, and are written in a distinctly non-conversational style. 1395","To address the limitations of extract-based summaries, we propose a complete and fully automatic domain-independent abstract generation framework for focused meeting summarization. Following existing language generation research (Angeli et al., 2010; Konstas and Lapata, 2012), we first perform content selection: given the dialogue acts relevant to one element of the meeting (e.g. a single decision or problem), we train a classifier to identify summary-worthy phrases. Next, we develop an “overgenerate-and-rank” strategy (Walker et al., 2001; Heilman and Smith, 2010) for surface realization, which generates and ranks candidate sentences for the abstract. After redundancy reduction, the full meeting abstract can thus comprise the focused summary for each meeting element. As described in subsequent sec-tions, the generation framework allows us to identify and reformulate the important information for the focused summary. Our contributions are as follows:","• To the best of our knowledge, our system is the first fully automatic system to generate natural language abstracts for spoken meetings.","• We present a novel template extraction algorithm, based on Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) (Durbin et al., 1998), to induce domain-independent templates that guide abstract generation. MSA is commonly used in bioinformatics to identify equivalent fragments of DNAs (Durbin et al., 1998) and has also been employed for learning para-phrases (Barzilay and Lee, 2003).","• Although our framework requires labeled training data for each type of focused summary (decisions, problems, etc.), we also make initial tries for domain adaptation so that our summarization method does not need human-written abstracts for each new meeting domain (e.g. faculty meetings, theater group meetings, project group meetings).","We instantiate the abstract generation framework on two corpora from disparate domains — the AMI Meeting Corpus (Mccowan et al., 2005) and ICSI Meeting Corpus (Janin et al., 2003) — and produce systems to generate focused summaries with regard to four types of meeting elements: DECISIONs, PROBLEMs, AC-TION ITEMSs, and PROGRESS. Automatic evaluation (using ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) and BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)) against manually generated focused summaries shows that our summarizers uniformly and statistically significantly outperform two baseline systems as well as a state-of-the-art supervised extraction-based system. Human evaluation also indicates that the abstractive summaries produced by our systems are more linguistically appealing than those of the utterance-level extraction-based system, preferring them over summaries from the extraction-based system of comparable semantic correctness (62.3% vs. 37.7%).","Finally, we examine the generality of our model across domains for two types of focused summarization — decisions and problems — by training the summarizer on out-of-domain data (i.e. the AMI corpus for use on the ICSI meeting data, and vice versa). The resulting systems yield results comparable to those from the same system trained on in-domain data, and statistically significantly outperform supervised extractive summarization approaches trained on in-domain data."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Most research on spoken dialogue summarization attempts to generate summaries for full dialogues (Carenini et al., 2011). Only recently has the task of focused summarization been studied. Supervised methods are investigated to identify key phrases or utterances for inclusion in the decision summary (Fernández et al., 2008; Bui et al., 2009). Based on Fernández et al. (2008), a relation representation is proposed by Wang and Cardie (2012) to form structured summaries; we adopt this representation here for content selection.","Our research is also in line with generating abstractive summaries for conversations. Extractive approaches (Murray et al., 2005; Xie et al., 2008; Galley, 2006) have been investigated extensively in conversation summarization. Murray et al. (2010a) present an abstraction system consisting of interpretation and transformation steps. Utterances are mapped to a simple conversation on-tology in the interpretation step according to their type, such as a decision or problem. Then an in-teger linear programming approach is employed to select the utterances that cover more entities as 1396 Dialogue Acts: C: Looking at what we've got, we we want [an LCD display with a spinning wheel].

It takes as input a cluster of meeting-item-specific dialogue acts, from which one focused summary is constructed. Sample relation instances are denoted in bold (The indicators are further italicized and the arguments are in [brackets]). Summary-worthy relation instances are identified by content selection module (see Section 4) and then filled into the learned templates individually. A statistical ranker subsequently selects one best abstract per relation instance (see Section 5.2). The post-selection component reduces the redundancy and outputs the final summary (see Section 5.3). determined by an external ontology. Liu and Liu (2009) apply sentence compression on extracted summary utterances. Though some of the unnecessary words are dropped, the resulting compressions can still be ungrammatical and unstructured.","This work is also broadly related to expert system-based language generation (Reiter and Dale, 2000) and concept-to-text generation tasks (Angeli et al., 2010; Konstas and Lapata, 2012), where the generation process is decomposed into content selection (or text planning) and surface realization. For instance, Angeli et al. (2010) learn from structured database records and parallel textual descriptions. They generate texts based on a series of decisions made to select the records, fields, and proper templates for render-ing. Those techniques that are tailored to specific domains (e.g. weather forecasts or sportcastings) cannot be directly applied to the conversational data, as their input is well-structured and the templates learned are domain-specific."]},{"title":"3 Framework","paragraphs":["Our domain-independent abstract generation framework produces a summarizer that generates a grammatical abstract from a cluster of meeting-element-related dialogue acts (DAs) — all utterances associated with a single decision, problem, action item or progress step of interest. Note that identifying these DA clusters is a difficult task in itself (Bui et al., 2009). Accordingly, our experiments evaluate two conditions — one in which we assume that they are perfectly identified, and one in which we identify the clusters automatically.","The summarizer consists of two major components and is depicted in Figure 2. Given the DA cluster to be summarized, the Content Selection module identifies a set of summary-worthy relation instances represented as indicator-argument pairs (i.e. these constitute a finer-grained representation than DAs). The Surface Realization component then generates a short summary in three steps. In the first step, each relation instance is filled into templates with disparate structures that are learned automatically from the training set (Template Filling). A statistical ranker then selects one best abstract per relation instance (Statistical Ranking). Finally, selected abstracts are processed for redundancy removal in Post-Selection. Detailed descrip-tions for each individual step are provided in Sec-tions 4 and 5."]},{"title":"4 Content Selection","paragraphs":["Phrase-based content selection approaches have been shown to support better meeting summaries (Fernández et al., 2008). Therefore, we chose a content selection representation of a finer granularity than an utterance: we identify relation instances that can both effectively detect the crucial content and incorporate enough syntactic information to facilitate the downstream surface realization.","More specifically, our relation instances are based on information extraction methods that identify a lexical indicator (or trigger) that evokes a relation of interest and then employ syntactic information, often in conjunction with semantic constraints, to find the argument constituent(or target phrase) to be extracted. Rela-1397 tion instances, then, are represented by indicator-argument pairs (Chen et al., 2011). For example, in the DA cluster of Figure 2, ⟨want, an LCD display with a spinning wheel⟩ and ⟨push-buttons, on the outside⟩ are two relation instances. Relation Instance Extraction We adopt and extend the syntactic constraints from Wang and Cardie (2012) to identify all relation instances in the input utterances; the summary-worthy ones will be selected by a discriminative classifier. Constituent and dependency parses are obtained by the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003). Both the indicator and argument take the form of constituents in the parse tree. We restrict the eligible indicator to be a noun or verb; the eligible arguments is a noun phrase (NP), prepositional phrase (PP) or adjectival phrase (ADJP). A valid indicator-argument pair should have at least one content word and satisfy one of the following constraints:","• When the indicator is a noun, the argument has to be a modifier or complement of the indicator.","• When the indicator is a verb, the argument has to be the subject or the object if it is an NP, or a modifier or complement of the indicator if it is a PP/ADJP.","We view relation extraction as a binary classification problem rather than a clustering task (Chen et al., 2011). All relation instances can be categorized as summary-worthy or not, but only the summary-worthy ones are used for abstract generation. A discriminative classifier is trained for this purpose based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Joachims, 1998) with an RBF kernel. For training data construction, we consider a relation instance to be a positive example if it shares any content word with its corresponding abstracts, and a negative example otherwise. The features used are shown in Table 1."]},{"title":"5 Surface Realization","paragraphs":["In this section, we describe surface realization, which renders the relation instances into natural language abstracts. This process begins with template extraction (Section 5.1). Once the templates are learned, the relation instances from Section 4 are filled into the templates to generate an abstract (see Section 5.2). Redundancy handling is discussed in Section 5.3. Basic Features number of words/content words portion of content words/stopwords number of content words in indicator/argument number of content words that are also in previous DA indicator/argument only contains stopword? number of new nouns Content Features has capitalized word? has proper noun? TF/IDF/TFIDF min/max/average Discourse Features main speaker or not? is in an adjacency pair (AP)? is in the source/target of the AP? number of source/target DA in the AP is the target of the AP a positive/negative/neutral response? is the source of the AP a question? Syntax Features indicator/argument constituent tag dependency relation of indicator and argument Table 1: Features for content selection. Most are adapted from previous work (Galley, 2006; Xie et al., 2008; Wang and Cardie, 2012). Every basic or content feature is concatenated with the constituent tags of indicator and argument to compose a new one. Main speakers include the most talkative speaker (who has said the most words) and other speakers whose word count is more than 20% of the most talkative one (Xie et al., 2008). Adjacency pair (AP) (Galley, 2006) is an important conversational analysis concept; each AP consists of a source utterance and a target utterance produced by different speakers. 5.1 Template Extraction Sentence Clustering. Template extraction starts with clustering the sentences that constitute the manually generated abstracts in the training data according to their lexical and structural similarity. From each cluster, multiple-sequence alignment techniques are employed to capture the recurring patterns.","Intuitively, desirable templates are those that can be applied in different domains to generate the same type of focused summary (e.g. decision or problem summaries). We do not want sentences to be clustered only because they describe the same domain-specific details (e.g. they are all about “data collection”), which will lead to fragmented templates that are not reusable for new domains. We therefore replace all appearances of dates, numbers, and proper names with generic labels. We also replace words that appear in both the abstract and supporting dialogue acts by a label indicating its phrase type. For any noun phrase with its head word abstracted, the whole phrase is also replaced with “NP”. 1398         start They The group were not sure whether to VP NP use NP should include end how much would cost to make","1) The group were not sure whether to [include]","VP [a recharger for the remote]","NP",".","2) The group were not sure whether to use [plastic and rubber or titanium for the case]","NP",".","3) The group were not sure whether [the remote control]","NP should include [functions for","controlling video] NP .","4) They were not sure how much [a recharger]","NP would cost to make .","...

(4) Template Induction MSA Figure 3: Example of template extraction by Multiple-Sequence Alignment for problem abstracts from AMI. Backbone nodes shared by at least 50% sentences are shaded. The grammatical errors exist in the original abstracts.","Following Barzilay and Lee (2003), we approach the sentence clustering task by hierarchical complete-link clustering with a similarity metric based on word n-gram overlap (n = 1, 2, 3). Clusters with fewer than three abstracts are removed1",". Learning the Templates via MSA. For learning the structural patterns among the abstracts, Multiple-Sequence Alignment (MSA) is first computed for each cluster. MSA takes as input multiple sentences and one scoring function to measure the similarity between any two words. For insertions or deletions, a gap cost is also added. MSA can thus find the best way to align the sequences with insertions or deletions in accordance with the scorer. However, computing an optimal MSA is NP-complete (Wang and Jiang, 1994), thus we implement an approximate algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970) that iteratively aligns two sequences each time and treats the resulting alignment as a new sequence2",". Figure 3 demonstrates an MSA computed from a sample cluster of ab-","1","Clustering stops when the similarity between any pair-wise clusters is below 5. This is applied to every type of summarization. We tune the parameter on a small held-out development set by manually evaluating the induced templates. No significant change is observed within a small range.","2","We adopt the scoring function for MSA from Barzilay and Lee (2003), where aligning two identical words scores 1, inserting a gap scores −0.01, and aligning two different words scores −0.5. stracts. The MSA is represented in the form of word lattice, from which we can detect the structural similarities shared by the sentences.","To transform the resulting MSAs into templates, we need to decide whether a word in the sentence should be retained to comprise the template or abstracted. The backbone nodes in an MSA are identified as the ones shared by more than 50%3","of the cluster’s sentences (shaded in gray in Figure 3). We then create a FINE template for each sentence by abstracting the non-backbone words, i.e. replacing each of those words with a generic token (last step in Figure 3). We also create a COARSE template that only preserves the nodes shared by all of the cluster’s sentences. By using the operations above, domain-independent patterns are thus identified and domain-specific details are removed.","Note that we do not explicitly evaluate the quality of the learned templates, which would require a significant amount of manual evaluation. In-stead, they are evaluated extrinsically. We encode the templates as features (Angeli et al., 2010) that could be selected or ignored in the succeeding abstract ranking model. 5.2 Template Filling An Overgenerate-and-Rank Approach. Since filling the relation instances into templates of distinct structures may result in abstracts of vary-ing quality, we rank the abstracts based on the features of the template, the transformation conducted, and the generated abstract. This is realized by the Overgenerate-and-Rank strategy (Walker et al., 2001; Heilman and Smith, 2010). It takes as input a set of relation instances (from the same cluster) R = {⟨indi, argi⟩}N","i=1 that are produced by content selection component, a set of templates T = {tj}M","j=1 that are represented as parsing trees, a transformation function F (described below), and a statistical ranker S for ranking the generated abstracts, for which we defer description later in this Section.","For each ⟨indi, argi⟩, the overgenerate-and-rank approach fills it into each template in T by applying F to generate all possible abstracts. Then the ranker S selects the best abstract absi. Post-selection is conducted on the abstracts {absi}N","i=1 to form the final summary. 3 See Barzilay and Lee (2003) for a detailed discussion","about the choice of 50% according to pigeonhole principle. 1399","The transformation function F models the constituent-level transformations of relation instances and their mappings to the parse trees of templates. With the intuition that people will reuse the relation instances from the transcripts albeit not necessarily in their original form to write the abstracts, we consider three major types of mapping operations for the indicator or argument in the source pair, namely, Full-Constituent Mapping, Sub-Constituent Mapping, and Removal. Full-Constituent Mapping denotes that a source constituent is mapped directly to a target constituent of the template parse tree with the same tag. Sub-Constituent Mapping encodes more complex and flexible transformations in that a sub-constituent of the source is mapped to a target constituent with the same tag. This operation applies when the source has a tag of PP or ADJP, in which case its sub-constituent, if any, with a tag of NP, VP or ADJP can be mapped to the target constituent with the same tag. For instance, an argument “with a spinning wheel” (PP) can be mapped to an NP in a template because it has a sub-constituent “a spinning wheel” (NP). Removal means a source is not mapped to any constituent in the template.","Formally, F is defined as:","F (⟨indsrc",", argsrc","⟩, t) =","{⟨indtran","k , argtran","k , indtar","k , argtar","k ⟩}K","k=1","where ⟨indsrc , argsrc","⟩ ∈ R is a relation in-","stance (source pair); t ∈ T is a template; indtran","k","and argtran","k is the transformed pair of indsrc","and","argsrc","; indtar k and argtar","k are constituents in t, and","they compose one target pair for ⟨indsrc",", argsrc","⟩.","We require that indsrc","and argsrc","are not removed","at the same time. Moreover, for valid indtar","k and argtar","k , the words subsumed by them should be all abstracted in the template, and they do not overlap in the parse tree.","To obtain the realized abstract, we traverse the parse tree of the filled template in pre-order. The words subsumed by the leaf nodes are thus collected sequentially. Learning a Statistical Ranker. We utilize a discriminative ranker based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) (Smola and Schölkopf, 2004) to rank the generated abstracts. Given the training data that includes clusters of gold-standard summary-worthy relation instances, associated abstracts they support, and the parallel templates for each abstract, training samples for the ranker are","Basic Features","number of words in indsrc","/argsrc","number of new nouns in indsrc","/argsrc","indtran k /argtran","k only has stopword?","number of new nouns in indtran","k /argtran","k Structure Features constituent tag of indsrc","/argsrc constituent tag of indsrc","with constituent tag of indtar constituent tag of argsrc","with constituent tag of argtar transformation of indsrc","/argsrc","combined with constituent tag dependency relation of indsrc","and argsrc dependency relation of indtar","and argtar above 2 features have same value?

The AMI meeting corpus (Mccowan et al., 2005) contains 139 scenario-driven meetings, where groups of four people participate in a series of four meetings for a fictitious project of designing remote control. The ICSI meeting corpus (Janin et al., 2003) consists of 75 naturally occurring meetings, each of them has 4 to 10 participants. Compared to the fabricated topics in AMI, the conversations in ICSI tend to be specialized and technical, e.g. discussion about speech and language technology. We use 57 meetings in ICSI and 139 meetings in AMI that include a short (usually one-sentence), manually constructed abstract summarizing each important output for every meeting. Decision and problem summaries are annotated for both corpora. AMI has extra action item summaries, and ICSI has progress summaries. The set of dialogue acts that support each abstract are annotated as such. System Inputs. We consider two system input settings. In the True Clusterings setting, we use the annotations to create perfect partitions of the DAs for input to the system; in the System Figure 4: Content selection evaluation by using ROUGE-SU4 (multiplied by 100).

Clusterings setting, we employ a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm used for this task in (Wang and Cardie, 2011). DAs are grouped according to a classifier trained beforehand. Baselines and Comparisons.

(2010), the LONGEST DA in each cluster is selected as the summary. The second baseline picks the cluster prototype (i.e. the DA with the largest TF-IDF similarity with the cluster centroid) as the summary according to Wang and Cardie (2011). Although it is possible that important content is spread over multiple DAs, both baselines allow us to determine summary quality when summaries are restricted to a single utterance.","Supervised Learning.

ROUGE computes the ngram overlapping between the system summaries with the reference summaries, and has been used for both text and speech summarization (Dang, 2005; Xie et al., 2008). We report ROUGE-2 (R-2) and ROUGE-SU4 (R-SU4) that are shown to correlate with human evaluation reasonably well.","In AMI, four meetings of different functions are carried out in each group5",". 35 meetings for “conceptual design” are randomly selected for testing. For ICSI, we reserve 12 meetings for testing.","The R-SU4 scores for each system are displayed in Figure 4 and show that our system uniformly outperforms the baselines and supervised systems. The learning curve of our system is relatively flat, which means not many training meetings are required to reach a usable performance level.","Note that the ROUGE scores are relative low when the reference summaries are human abstracts, even for evaluation among abstracts produced by different annotators (Dang, 2005). The intrinsic difference of styles between dialogue and human abstract further lowers the scores. But the trend is still respected among the systems. Abstract Generation Evaluation. To evaluate the full abstract generation system, the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) (the precision of unigrams and bigrams with a brevity penalty) is computed with human abstracts as reference. BLEU has a fairly good agreement with human judge-ment and has been used to evaluate a variety of language generation systems (Angeli et al., 2010; Konstas and Lapata, 2012). 4 We use SVMlight","(Joachims, 1999) with RBF kernel by","default parameters for SVM-based classifiers and regressor. 5 The four types of meetings in AMI are: project kick-off","(35 meetings), functional design (35 meetings), conceptual","design (35 meetings), and detailed design (34 meetings). Figure 5: Full abstract generation system evaluation by using BLEU (multiplied by 100). SVM-DA denotes for supervised extractive methods with SVMs on utterance-level.","We are not aware of any existing work generating abstractive summaries for conversations. Therefore, we compare our full system against a supervised utterance-level extractive method based on SVMs along with the baselines. The BLEU scores in Figure 5 show that our system improves the scores consistently over the baselines and the SVM-based approach. Domain Adaptation Evaluation. We further examine our system in domain adaptation scenarios for decision and problem summarization, where we train the system on AMI for use on ICSI, and vice versa. Table 3 indicates that, with both true clusterings and system clusterings, our system trained on out-of-domain data achieves comparable performance with the same system trained on in-domain data. In most experiments, it also significantly outperforms the baselines and the extract-based approaches (p < 0.05). Human Evaluation. We randomly select 15 decision and 15 problem DA clusters (true clusterings). We evaluate fluency (is the text grammatical?) and semantic correctness (does the summary convey the gist of the DAs in the cluster?) for OUR SYSTEM trained on IN-domain data 1402","System (True Clusterings) AMI Decision ICSI Decision AMI Problem ICSI Problem","R-2 R-SU4 BLEU R-2 R-SU4 BLEU R-2 R-SU4 BLEU R-2 R-SU4 BLEU CENTROID DA 1.3 3.0 7.7 1.8 3.5 3.8 1.0 2.7 4.2 1.0 2.3 2.8 LONGEST DA 1.6 3.3 7.0 2.8 4.7 6.5 1.0 3.0 3.6 1.2 3.4 4.6 SVM-DA (IN) 3.4 4.7 9.7 3.4 4.5 5.7 1.4 2.4 5.0 1.6 3.4 3.4 SVM-DA (OUT) 2.7 4.2 6.6 3.1 4.2 4.6 1.4 2.2 2.5 1.3 3.0 4.6 OUR SYSTEM (IN) 4.5 6.2 11.6 4.9 7.1 10.0 3.1 4.8 7.2 4.0 5.9 6.0","OUR SYSTEM (OUT) 4.6 6.1 10.3 4.8 6.4 7.8 3.5 4.7 6.2 3.0 5.5 5.3","ORACLE 7.5 12.0 22.8 9.9 14.9 20.2 6.6 11.3 18.9 6.4 12.6 13.0","System (System Clusterings) AMI Decision ICSI Decision AMI Problem ICSI Problem","R-2 R-SU4 BLEU R-2 R-SU4 BLEU R-2 R-SU4 BLEU R-2 R-SU4 BLEU CENTROID DA 1.4 3.3 3.8 1.4 2.1 2.0 0.8 2.8 2.9 0.9 2.3 1.8 LONGEST DA 1.4 3.3 5.7 1.7 3.4 5.5 0.8 3.2 4.1 0.9 3.4 4.4 SVM-DA (IN) 2.6 4.6 10.5 3.5 6.5 7.1 1.8 3.7 4.9 1.8 4.0 4.6 SVM-DA (OUT) 3.4 5.8 10.3 2.7 4.8 6.3 2.1 3.8 4.3 1.5 3.8 3.5 OUR SYSTEM (IN) 3.5 5.4 11.7 4.4 7.4 9.1 3.3 4.6 9.5 2.3 4.2 7.4","OUR SYSTEM (OUT) 3.9 6.4 11.4 4.1 5.1 8.4 3.6 5.6 8.9 1.8 4.0 6.8","ORACLE 6.4 12.0 15.1 8.2 15.2 17.6 6.5 13.0 20.9 5.5 11.9 15.5 Table 3: Domain adaptation evaluation.
