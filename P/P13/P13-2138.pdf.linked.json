However, the potential benefits of such data are yet to be fully realized due to the complexity and noise in the alignment between image content and text. We address this challenge with contributions in two folds: first, we introduce the new task of image caption generalization, formulated as visually-guided sentence compression, and present an efficient algorithm based on dynamic beam search with dependency-based constraints. Second, we release a new large-scale corpus with 1 million image-caption pairs achieving tighter content alignment between images and text.

However, subtleties and complexity in the relationship between image content and text make exploiting paired visual-textual data an open and interesting problem.","Some recent work has approached the problem of composing natural language descriptions for images by using computer vision to retrieve images with similar content and then transferring “A house being pulled by a boat.” “I saw her in the light of her reading lamp and sneaked back to her door with the camera.” “Sections of the bridge sitting in the Dyer Construction yard south of Cabelas Driver.” Circumstantial","information that is not visually present Visually relevant, but with overly extraneous details Visually truthful,","but for an uncommon","situation Figure 1: Examples of captions that are not readily applicable to other visually similar images. text from the retrieved samples to the query image (e.g. Farhadi et al. (2010), Ordonez et al. (2011), Kuznetsova et al. (2012)). Other work (e.g. Feng and Lapata (2010a), Feng and Lapata (2010b)) uses computer vision to bias summarization of text associated with images to produce descriptions. All of these approaches rely on existing text that describes visual content, but many times existing image descriptions contain significant amounts of extraneous, non-visual, or other-wise non-desirable content. The goal of this paper is to develop techniques to automatically clean up visually descriptive text to make it more directly usable for applications exploiting the connection between images and language.","As a concrete example, consider the first image in Figure 1. This caption was written by the photo owner and therefore contains information related to the context of when and where the photo was taken. Objects such as “lamp”, “door”, “camera” are not visually present in the photo. The second image shows a similar but somewhat different is-sue. Its caption describes visible objects such as “bridge” and “yard”, but “Cabelas Driver” are overly specific and not visually detectable.

(2012).","The content misalignment between images and text limits the extent to which visual detectors can learn meaningful mappings between images and text. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the new task of image caption generalization that rewrites captions to be more visually relevant and more readily applicable to other visually similar images. Our end goal is to convert noisy image-text pairs in the wild (Ordonez et al., 2011) into pairs with tighter content alignment, resulting in new simplified captions over 1 million images. Evaluation results show both the intrinsic quality of the generalized captions and the extrinsic utility of the new image-text parallel corpus. The new parallel corpus will be made publicly available.2"]},{"title":"2 Sentence Generalization as Constraint Optimization","paragraphs":["Casting the generalization task as visually-guided sentence compression with lightweight revisions, we formulate a constraint optimization problem that aims to maximize content selection and local linguistic fluency while satisfying constraints driven from dependency parse trees. Dependency-based constraints guide the generalized caption","1","Open domain computer vision remains to be an open problem, and it would be difficult to reliably distinguish pictures of subtle visual differences, e.g., pictures of “a water front house with a docked boat” from those of “a floating house pulled by a boat”.","2","Available at http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/ ỹchoi/imgcaption/ to be grammatically valid (e.g., keeping articles in place, preventing dangling modifiers) while remaining semantically compatible with respect to a given image-text pair (e.g., preserving predicateargument relations). More formally, we maximize the following objective function: F (y; x) = Φ(y; x, v) + Ψ(y; x) subject to C(y; x, v) where x = {xi} is the input caption (a sentence), v is the accompanying image, y = {yi} is the output sentence, Φ(y; x, v) is the content selection score, Ψ(y; x) is the linguistic fluency score, and C(y; x, v) is the set of hard constraints. Let l(yi) be the index of the word in x that is selected as the i’th word in the output y so that xl(yi) = yi. Then, we factorize Φ(·) and Ψ(·) as: Φ(y; x, v) = ∑ i φ(yi, x, v) = ∑ i φ(xl(yi), v) Ψ(y; x) = ∑ i ψ(yi, ..., yi−K ) = ∑ i ψ(xl(yi), ..., xl(yi−K)) where K is the size of local context. Content Selection – Visual Estimates: The computer vision system used consists of 7404 visual classifiers for recognizing leaf level WordNet synsets (Fellbaum, 1998). Each classifier is trained using labeled images from the ImageNet dataset (Deng et al., 2009) – an image database of over 14 million hand labeled images organized according to the WordNet hierarchy. Image similarity is represented using a Spatial Pyramid Match Kernel (SPM) (Lazebnik et al., 2006) with Locality-constrained Linear Coding (Wang et al., 2010) on shape based SIFT features (Lowe, 2004). 791 (a) (b) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 200 400 600 800 #  o f  s e n t e n c e s  ( i n  t h o u s a n d s ) 0 1 2 3 4 0 400 800 1200 #  o f  s e n t e n c e s  ( i n  t h o u s a n d s ) Figure 2: Number of sentences (y-axis) for each average (x-axis in (a)) and maximum (x-axis in (b)) number of words with future dependencies Models are linear SVMs followed by a sigmoid to produce probability for each node.3 Content Selection – Salient Topics: We consider Tf.Idf driven scores to favor salient topics, as those are more likely to generalize across many different images. Additionally, we assign a very low content selection score (−∞) for proper nouns and numbers and a very high score (larger then maximum idf or visual score) for the 2k most frequent words in our corpus. Local Linguistic Fluency: We model linguistic fluency with 3-gram condi-tional probabilities: ψ(xl(yi), xl(yi−1), xl(yi−2)) (1) = p(xl(yi)|xl(yi−2), xl(yi−1))","We experiment with two different ngram statistics, one extracted from the Google Web 1T corpus (Brants and Franz., 2006), and the other computed from the 1M image-caption corpus (Ordonez et al., 2011). Dependency-driven Constraints: Table 1 defines the list of dependencies used as constraints driven from the typed dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2009; de Marneffe et al., 2006). The direction of arrows indicate the direction of inclusion requirements. For example, dep(X ←− Y ), denotes that “ X” must be included whenever “ Y ” is included. Similarly, dep(X ←→ Y ) denotes that “ X” and “ Y ” must either be included together or eliminated together. We determine the uni- or bi-directionality of these constraints by manually examining a few example sentences corresponding to each of these typed dependencies. Note that some dependencies such as det(←→) would hold regardless of the particular","3","Code was provided by Deng et al. (2012). Method-1 (M1) v.s.

Those dependencies that we determine as largely context dependent are marked with * in Table 1.","One could consider enforcing all dependency constraints in Table 1 as hard constraints so that the compressed sentence must not violate any of those directed dependency constraints. Doing so would lead to overly conservative compression with least compression ratio however. Therefore, we relax those that are largely context dependent as soft constraints (marked in Table 1 with *) by introducing a constant penalty term in the objective function. Alternatively, the dependency based constraints can be learned statistically from the training corpus of paired original and compressed sentences. Since we do not have such in-domain training data at this time, we leave this exploration as future research. Dynamic Programming with Dynamic Beam: The constraint optimization we formulated corresponds to an NP-hard problem. In our work, hard constraints are based only on typed dependencies, and we find that long range dependencies occur in-frequently in actual image descriptions, as plotted in Figure 2. With this insight, we opt for decoding based on dynamic programming with dynamically adjusted beam.4","Alternatively, one can find an approximate solution using Integer Linear Programming (e.g., Clarke and Lapata (2006), Clarke and Lapata (2007), Martins and Smith (2009))."]},{"title":"3 Evaluation","paragraphs":["Since there is no existing benchmark data for image caption generalization, we crowdsource evaluation using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT).

Results are shown in Table 2. We observe that VISUAL (full model with visually guided content selection) performs the best, being selected over SALIENCY (content-selection without visual information) in 72.48% cases, and even over the original image caption in 81.75% cases.","This forced-selection experiment between VISUAL and ORIG demonstrates the degree of noise prevalent in the image captions in the wild. Of course, if compared against human-compressed captions, the automatic captions are preferred much less frequently – in 19% of the cases. In those 19% cases when automatic captions are preferred over human-compressed ones, it is some-times that humans did not fully remove information that is not visually present or verifiable, and other times humans overly compressed. To verify the utility of dependency-based constraints, we also compare two variations of VISUAL, with and without dependency-based constraints. As expected, the algorithm with constraints is preferred in the majority of cases.","3.2 Extrinsic Evaluation: Image-based Caption Retrieval We evaluate the usefulness of our new image-text parallel corpus for automatic generation of image descriptions. Here the task is to produce, for a query image, a relevant description, i.e., a visually descriptive caption. Following Ordonez et al. (2011), we produce a caption for a query image by finding top k most similar images within the 1M image-text corpus (Ordonez et al., 2011) and then transferring their captions to the query image. To compute evaluation measures, we take the average scores of BLEU(1) and F-score (unigram-based with respect to content-words) over k = 5 candidate captions.","Image similarity is computed using two global (whole) image descriptors. The first is the GIST feature (Oliva and Torralba, 2001), an image descriptor related to perceptual characteristics of scenes – naturalness, roughness, openness, etc. The second descriptor is also a global image descriptor, computed by resizing the image into a “tiny image” (Torralba et al., 2008), which is effective in matching the structure and overall color of images. To find visually relevant images, we compute the similarity of the query image to im-793 Huge wall of glass at the Conference Centre in Yohohama Japan.  Wall of glass My footprint in a sand box  A sand box James the cat is dreaming of running in a wide green valley  Running in a valley (not relevant) This little boy was so cute.

The results are shown in Table 3. Strict matching gives credit only to identical words between the gold-standard caption and the automatically produced caption. However, words in the original caption of the query image (and its compressed caption) do not overlap exactly with words in the retrieved captions, even when they are semantically very close, which makes it hard to see improvements even when the captions of the new corpus are more general and transferable over other images. Therefore, we also report scores based on semantic matching, which gives partial credits to word pairs based on their lexical similarity.5","The best performing approach with semantic matching is VISUAL (with LM = Image corpus), improving BLEU, Precision, F-score substantially over those of ORIG, demonstrating the extrinsic utility of our newly generated image-text parallel corpus in comparison to the original database.

Future work includes exploring more direct supervision from human edited sample generalization (e.g., Knight and Marcu (2000), McDonald (2006)) Galley and McKeown (2007), Zhu et al.
