The WMT organizers invite research groups to submit translation systems in eight different tracks: Czech to/from English, French to/from English, German to/from English, and Spanish to/from English.","For each track, the organizers also assemble a panel of judges, typically machine translation specialists.1","The role of a judge is to repeatedly rank five different translations of the same source text. Ties are permitted. In Table 1, we show an example2","where a judge (we’ll call him “jdoe”) has ranked five translations of the French sentence “Il ne va pas.”","Each such elicitation encodes ten pairwise comparisons, as shown in Table 2. For each competition track, WMT typically elicits between 5000 and 20000 comparisons. Once the elicitation process is complete, WMT faces a large database of comparisons and a question that must be an-swered: whose system is the best?","1","Although in recent competitions, some of the judging has also been crowdsourced (Callison-Burch et al., 2010).","2","The example does not use actual system output. rank system translation 1 bbn “He does not go.” 2 (tie) uedin “He goes not.” 2 (tie) jhu “He did not go.” 4 cmu “He go not.” 5 kit “He not go.” Table 1: WMT elicits preferences by asking judges to simultaneously rank five translations, with ties permitted.

A preference of 0 means neither translation was preferred. Otherwise the preference specifies the preferred system."]},{"title":"2 A Ranking Problem","paragraphs":["For several years, WMT used the following heuristic for ranking the translation systems: ORIGWMT(s) =","win(s) + tie(s) win(s) + tie(s) + loss(s) For system s, win(s) is the number of pairwise comparisons in which s was preferred, loss(s) is the number of comparisons in which s was dispreferred, and tie(s) is the number of comparisons in which s participated but neither system was preferred.","Recently, (Bojar et al., 2011) questioned the adequacy of this heuristic through the following ar-1416 gument. Consider a competition with systems A and B. Suppose that the systems are different but equally good, such that one third of the time A is judged better than B, one third of the time B is judged better than A, and one third of the time they are judged to be equal. The expected values of ORIGWMT(A) and ORIGWMT(B) are both 2/3, so the heuristic accurately judges the systems to be equivalently good. Suppose however that we had duplicated B and had submitted it to the competition a second time as system C. Since B and C produce identical translations, they should always tie with one another. The expected value of ORIGWMT(A) would not change, but the expected value of ORIGWMT(B) would increase to 5/6, buoyed by its ties with system C.","This vulnerability prompted (Bojar et al., 2011) to offer the following revision: BOJAR(s) =","win(s) win(s) + loss(s) The following year, it was BOJAR’s turn to be criticized, this time by (Lopez, 2012): Superficially, this appears to be an improvement....couldn’t a system still be penalized simply by being compared to [good systems] more frequently than its competitors? On the other hand, couldn’t a system be rewarded simply by being compared against a bad system more frequently than its competitors? Lopez’s concern, while reasonable, is less obviously damning than (Bojar et al., 2011)’s criticism of ORIGWMT. It depends on whether the collected set of comparisons is small enough or biased enough to make the variance in competition significant. While this hypothesis is plausible, Lopez makes no attempt to verify it. Instead, he offers a ranking heuristic of his own, based on a Minimum Feedback Arc solver.","The proliferation of ranking heuristics continued from there. The WMT 2012 organizers (Callison-Burch et al., 2012) took Lopez’s ranking scheme and provided a variant called Most Probable Ranking. Then, noting some potential pitfalls with that, they created two more, called Monte Carlo Playoffs and Expected Wins. While one could raise philosophical objections about each of these, where would it end? Ultimately, the WMT 2012 findings presented five different rankings for the English-German competition track, with no guidance about which ranking we should pay at-tention to. How can we know whether one ranking is better than other? Or is this even the right question to ask?"]},{"title":"3 A Problem with Rankings","paragraphs":["Suppose four systems participate in a translation competition. Three of these systems are extremely close in quality. We’ll call these close1, close2, and close3. Nevertheless, close1 is very slightly better3","than close2, and close2 is very slightly better than close3. The fourth system, called terrific, is a really terrific system that far exceeds the other three.","Now which is the better ranking? terrific, close3, close1, close2 (1) close1, terrific, close2, close3 (2) Spearman’s rho4","would favor the second ranking, since it is a less disruptive permutation of the gold ranking. But intuition favors the first. While its mistakes are minor, the second ranking makes the hard-to-forgive mistake of placing close1 ahead of the terrific system.","The problem is not with Spearman’s rho. The problem is the disconnnect between the knowledge that we want a ranking to reflect and the knowledge that a ranking actually contains. With-out this additional knowledge, we cannot determine whether one ranking is better than another, even if we know the gold ranking. We need to determine what information they lack, and define more rigorously what we hope to learn from a translation competition."]},{"title":"4 From Rankings to Relative Ability","paragraphs":["Ostensibly the purpose of a translation competition is to determine the relative ability of a set of translation systems. Let S be the space of all translation systems. Hereafter, we will refer to S as the space of students. We choose this term to evoke the metaphor of a translation competition as a standardized test, which shares the same goal: to assess the relative abilities of a set of participants.","But what exactly do we mean by “ability”? Before formally defining this term, first recognize that it means little without context, namely:","3","What does “better” mean? We’ll return to this question.","4","Or Pearson’s correlation coefficient. 1417","1. What kind of source text do we want the systems to translate well? Say system A is great at translating travel-related documents, but terrible at translating newswire. Mean-while, system B is pretty good at both. The question “which system is better?” requires us to state how much we care about travel versus newswire documents – otherwise the question is underspecified.","2. Who are we trying to impress? While it’s tempting to think that translation quality is a universal notion, the 50-60% interannotator agreement in WMT evaluations (Callison-Burch et al., 2012) suggests otherwise. It’s also easy to imagine reasons why one group of judges might have different priorities than another. Think a Fortune 500 company versus web forum users. Lawyers versus laymen. Non-native versus native speakers. Posteditors versus Google Translate users. Different groups have different uses for translation, and therefore different definitions of what “better” means. With this in mind, let’s define some additional elements of a translation competition. Let X be the space of all possible segments of source text, J be the space of all possible judges, and Π = {0, 1, 2} be the space of pairwise preferences.5","We assume all spaces are countable. Unless stated otherwise, variables s1 and s2 represent students from S, variable x represents a segment from X , variable j represents a judge from J , and variable π represents a preference from Π. Moreover, define the negation π̂ of preference π such that π̂ = 2 (if π = 1), π̂ = 1 (if π = 2), and π̂ = 0 (if π = 0).","Now assume a joint distribution P (s1, s2, x, j, π) specifying the probability that we ask judge j to evaluate students s1 and s2’s respective translations of source text x, and that judge j’s preference is π. We will further assume that the choice of student pair, source text, and judge are marginally independent of one another. In other words: P (s1, s2, x, j, π) = P (π|s1, s2, x, j) · P (x|s1, s2, j) ·P (j|s1, s2) · P (s1, s2) = P (π|s1, s2, x, j) · P (x) · P (j) · P (s1, s2) = PX (x) · PJ (j) · P (s1, s2) · P (π|s1, s2, x, j) 5 As a reminder, 0 indicates no preference. It will be useful to reserve notation PX and PJ for the marginal distributions over source text and judges. We can marginalize over the source segments and judges to obtain a useful quantity: P (π|s1, s2) = ∑ x∈X ∑ j∈J PX (x) · PJ (j) · P (π|s1, s2, x, j) We refer to this as the ⟨PX , PJ ⟩-relative ability of students s1 and s2. By using different marginal distributions PX , we can specify what kinds of source text interest us (for instance, PX could focus most of its probability mass on German tweets). Similarly, by using different marginal distributions PJ , we can specify what judges we want to impress (for instance, PJ could focus all of its mass on one important corporate customer or evenly among all fluent bilingual speakers of a language pair).","With this machinery, we can express the purpose of a translation competition more clearly: to estimate the ⟨PX , PJ ⟩-relative ability of a set of students. In the case of WMT, PJ presumably6","defines a space of competent source-to-target bilingual speakers, while PX defines a space of newswire documents.","We’ll refer to an estimate of P (π|s1, s2) as a preference model. In other words, a preference model is a distribution Q(π|s1, s2). Given a set of pairwise comparisons (e.g., Table 2), the challenge is to estimate a preference model Q(π|s1, s2) such that Q is “close” to P . For measuring distributional proximity, a natural choice is KL-divergence (Kullback and Leibler, 1951), but we cannot use it here because P is unknown.","Fortunately, if we have i.i.d. data drawn from P , then we can do the next best thing and compute the perplexity of preference model Q on this heldout test data. Let D be a sequence of triples ⟨s1, s2, π⟩ where the preferences π are i.i.d. samples from P (π|s1, s2). The perplexity of preference model Q on test data D is: perplexity(Q|D) = 2 − ∑ ⟨s 1,s","2,π⟩∈D 1 |D| log2 Q(π|s1,s2) How do we obtain such a test set from competition data? Recall that a WMT competition produces pairwise comparisons like those in Table 2. 6","One could argue that it specifies a space of machine translation specialists, but likely these individuals are thought to be a representative sample of a broader community. 1418 Let C be the set of comparisons ⟨s1, s2, x, j, π⟩ obtained from a translation competition. Competition data C is not necessarily7","sampled i.i.d. from P (s1, s2, x, j, π) because we may intentionally8","bias data collection towards certain students, judges or source text. Also, because WMT elicits its data in batches (see Table 1), every segment x of source text appears in at least ten comparisons.","To create an appropriately-sized test set that closely resembles i.i.d. data, we isolate the subset C′","of comparisons whose source text appears in at most k comparisons, where k is the smallest positive integer such that |C′","| >= 2000. We then create the test set D from C′",":","D = {⟨s1, s2, π⟩|⟨s1, s2, x, j, π⟩ ∈ C′ } We reserve the remaining comparisons for training preference models. Table 3 shows the resulting dataset sizes for each competition track.","Unlike with raw rankings, the claim that one preference model is better than another has testable implications. Given two competing models, we can train them on the same comparisons, and compare their perplexities on the test set. This gives us a quantitative9","answer to the question of which is the better model. We can then publish a system ranking based on the most trustworthy preference model."]},{"title":"5 Baselines","paragraphs":["Let’s begin then, and create some simple preference models to serve as baselines. 5.1 Uniform The simplest preference model is a uniform distribution over preferences, for any choice of students s1, s2: Q(π|s1, s2) = 1 3 ∀π ∈ Π This will be our only model that does not require training data, and its perplexity on any test set will be 3 (i.e. equal to number of possible preferences). 5.2 Adjusted Uniform Now suppose we have a set C of comparisons available for training.

C(s1, s2) denote the subset comparing students s1 and s2.","Perhaps the simplest thing we can do with the training data is to estimate the probability of ties (i.e. preference 0).

In other words, for each pair of students s1 and s2, we estimate a separate preference distribution. The maximum likelihood estimate of each distribution would be: Q(π|s1, s2) = |Cπ(s1, s2)| + |Cπ̂(s2, s1)| |C(s1, s2)| + |C(s2, s1)| However the maximum likelihood estimate would test poorly, since any zero probability estimates for test set preferences would result in infinite perplexity. To make this model practical, we assume a symmetric Dirichlet prior with strength α for each preference distribution. This gives us the following Bayesian estimate: Q(π|s1, s2) = α + |Cπ(s1, s2)| + |Cπ̂(s2, s1)| 3α + |C(s1, s2)| + |C(s2, s1)| We call this the Independent Pairs preference model. 6.2 Independent Students The Independent Pairs model makes a strong independence assumption. It assumes that even if we know that student A is much better than student B, and that student B is much better than student C, we can infer nothing about how student A will fare versus student C. Instead of directly estimating the relative ability P (π|s1, s2) of students s1 and s2, we could instead try to estimate the universal ability P (π|s1) =","∑","s2∈S P (π|s1, s2) · P (s2|s1) of each individual student s1 and then try to reconstruct the relative abilities from these estimates.

A downside of this approach is that there is no principled way to reconstruct a preference model from the universal ability estimates. We experiment with three ad-hoc reconstructions. The asymmetric reconstruction simply ignores any information we have about student s2: Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) The arithmetic and geometric reconstructions compute an arithmetic/geometric average of the two universal abilities: Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) + Q(π̂|s2)","2","Q(π|s1, s2) = [Q(π|s1) ∗ Q(π̂|s2)] 1 2 We respectively call these the (Asymmetric/Arithmetic/Geometric) Independent Students preference models. Notice the similarities between the universal ability estimates Q(π|s1) and the BOJAR ranking heuristic. These three models are our attempt to render the BOJAR heuristic as preference models."]},{"title":"7 Item-Response Theoretic (IRT) Models","paragraphs":["Let’s revisit (Lopez, 2012)’s objection to the BOJAR ranking heuristic: “...couldn’t a system still be penalized simply by being compared to [good systems] more frequently than its competitors?” The official WMT 2012 findings (Callison-Burch et al., 2012) echoes this concern in justifying the exclusion of reference translations from the 2012 competition: [W]orkers have a very clear preference for reference translations, so includ-ing them unduly penalized systems that, through (un)luck of the draw, were pitted against the references more often. Presuming the students are paired uniformly at random, this issue diminishes as more comparisons are elicited. But preference elicitation is expensive, so it makes sense to assess the relative ability of the students with as few elicitations as possible. Still, WMT 2012’s decision to eliminate references entirely is a bit of a draconian measure, a treatment of the symptom rather than the (perceived) disease. If our models cannot function in the presence of training data variation, then we should change the models, not the data. A model that only works when the students are all about the same level is not one we should rely on.","We experiment with a simple model that relaxes some independence assumptions made by previous models, in order to allow training data variation (e.g. who a student has been paired with) to influence the estimation of the student abilities. Figure 1(left) shows plate notation (Koller and Friedman, 2009) for the model’s independence structure. First, each student’s ability distribution is drawn from a common prior distribution. Then a number of translation items are generated. Each item is authored by a student and has a quality drawn from the student’s ability distribution. Then a number of pairwise comparisons are generated. Each comparison has two options, each a translation item. The quality of each item is observed by a judge (possibly noisily) and then the judge states a preference by comparing the two observations.","We investigate two parameterizations of this model: Gaussian and categorical. Figure 1(right) shows an example of the Gaussian parameterization. The student ability distributions are Gaussians with a known standard deviation σa, drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian prior with known standard deviation σ0. In the example, we show the ability distributions for students 6 (an above-average student, whose mean is 0.4) and 14 (a poor student, whose mean is -0.6). We also show an item authored by each student. Item 43 has a somewhat low quality of -0.3 (drawn from student 14’s ability distribution), while item 205 is not student 6’s best work (he produces a mean quality of 0.4), but still has a decent quality at 0.2. Comparison 1 pits these items against one another. A judge draws noise from a zero-mean Gaussian with known standard deviation σobs, then adds this to the item’s actual quality to get an observed quality. For the first option (item 43), the judge draws a noise of -0.12 to observe a quality of -0.42 (worse than it actually is). For the second option (item 205), the judge draws a noise of 0.15 to observe a quality of 0.35 (better than it actually is). Finally, the judge compares the two observed qualities.

Otherwise he prefers the item with the higher observed quality.","The categorical parameterization is similar to the Gaussian parameterization, with the following differences. Item quality is not continuous, but rather a member of the discrete set {1, 2, ..., Λ}. The student ability distributions are categorical distributions over {1, 2, ..., Λ}, and the student ability prior is a symmetric Dirichlet with strength αa. Finally, the observed quality is the item quality λ plus an integer-valued noise ν ∈ {1 − λ, ..., Λ − λ}. Noise ν is drawn from a discretized zero-mean Gaussian with standard deviation σobs. Specifically,P r(ν) is proportional to the value of the probability density function of the zero-mean Gaussian N (0, σobs).","We estimated the model parameters with Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984).

From the testing perspective, we can view each comparison as two students simultaneously posing a test question to the other: “Give me a translation of the source text which is better than mine.” The students can answer the question correctly, incorrectly, or they can provide a translation of analogous quality.

This somewhat validates the organizers’ decision to exclude the references, particularly given WMT’s use of the BOJAR ranking heuristic (the nucleus of the Independent Student models) for its official rankings.","13","Results for WMT10 exclude the German-English and English-German tracks, since we used these to tune our model hyperparameters.

Rather than the current anecdotal approach to comparing competition analyses (e.g. presenting example rankings that seem some-how wrong), we can empirically compare the predictive power of the models on test data.","2. How much of an impact does judge noise have on my conclusions? We showed that judge noise can have a significant impact on the quality of our conclusions, if we use the wrong models.

Many of our preference models (including IRT-Gaussian and Geometric Independent Students) are close to convergence at around 1000 comparisons.
