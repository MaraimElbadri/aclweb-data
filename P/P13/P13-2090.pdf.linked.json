Starting with a domain-independent, high-precision sentiment lexicon and a large pool of unlabeled data, we bootstrap Twitter-specific sentiment lexicons, using a small amount of labeled data to guide the process. Our experiments on English, Spanish and Russian show that the resulting lexicons are effective for sentiment classification for many under-explored languages in social media."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The language that people use to express opinions and sentiment is extremely diverse. This is true for well-formed data, such as news and reviews, and it is particularly true for data from social media. Communication in social media is informal, abbreviations and misspellings abound, and the person communicating is often trying to be funny, creative, and entertaining. Topics change rapidly, and people invent new words and phrases.","The dynamic nature of social media together with the extreme diversity of subjective language has implications for any system with the goal of analyzing sentiment in this domain. General, domain-independent sentiment lexicons have low coverage. Even models trained specifically on social media data may degrade somewhat over time as topics change and new sentiment-bearing terms crop up. For example, the word “occupy” would not have been indicative of sentiment before 2011.","Most of the previous work on sentiment lexicon construction relies on existing natural language processing tools, e.g., syntactic parsers (Wiebe, 2000), information extraction (IE) tools (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) or rich lexical resources such as WordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). However, such tools and lexical resources are not available for many languages spoken in social media. While English is still the top language in Twitter, it is no longer the majority. Thus, the applicabil-ity of these approaches is limited. Any method for analyzing sentiment in microblogs or other social media streams must be easily adapted to (1) many low-resource languages, (2) the dynamic nature of social media, and (3) working in a streaming mode with limited or no supervision.","Although bootstrapping has been used for learning sentiment lexicons in other domains (Turney and Littman, 2002; Banea et al., 2008), it has not yet been applied to learning sentiment lexicons for microblogs. In this paper, we present an approach for bootstrapping subjectivity clues from Twitter data, and evaluate our approach on English, Spanish and Russian Twitter streams. Our approach:","• handles the informality, creativity and the dy-","namic nature of social media;","• does not rely on language-dependent tools;","• scales to the hundreds of new under-explored","languages and dialects in social media;","• classifies sentiment in a streaming mode.","To bootstrap subjectivity clues from Twitter streams we rely on three main assumptions:","i. sentiment-bearing terms of similar orienta-","tion tend to co-occur at the tweet level (Tur-","ney and Littman, 2002);","ii. sentiment-bearing terms of opposite orienta-","tion do not co-occur at the tweet level (Ga-","mon and Aue, 2005); iii. the co-occurrence of domain-specific and","domain-independent subjective terms serves","as a signal of subjectivity. 505"]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Mihalcea et.al (2012) classifies methods for bootstrapping subjectivity lexicons into two types: corpus-based and dictionary-based.","Dictionary-based methods rely on existing lexical resources to bootstrap sentiment lexicons. Many researchers have explored using relations in WordNet (Miller, 1995), e.g., Esuli and Sabastiani (2006), Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006) for English, Rao and Ravichandran (2009) for Hindi and French, and Perez-Rosas et al. (2012) for Spanish. Mohammad et al. (2009) use a thesaurus to aid in the construction of a sentiment lexicon for English. Other works (Clematide and Klenner, 2010; Abdul-Mageed et al., 2011) automatically expands and evaluates German and Arabic lexicons. However, the lexical resources that dictionary-based methods need, do not yet exist for the majority of languages in social media. There is also a mismatch between the formality of many language resources, such as WordNet, and the extremely in-formal language of social media.","Corpus-based methods extract subjectivity and sentiment lexicons from large amounts of unlabeled data using different similarity metrics to measure the relatedness between words. Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) were the first to explore automatically learning the polarity of words from corpora. Early work by Wiebe (2000) identifies clusters of subjectivity clues based on their distributional similarity, using a small amount of data to bootstrap the process. Turney (2002) and Velikovich et al. (2010) bootstrap sentiment lexicons for English from the web by using Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and graph propaga-tion approach, respectively. Kaji and Kitsuregawa (2007) propose a method for building sentiment lexicon for Japanese from HTML pages. Banea et al. (2008) experiment with Lexical Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Dumais et al., 1988) to bootstrap a subjectivity lexicon for Romanian. Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) bootstrap subjectivity lexicons for Japanese by generating subjectivity can-didates based on word co-occurrence patterns.","In contrast to other corpus-based bootstrapping methods, we evaluate our approach on multiple languages, specifically English, Spanish, and Russian. Also, as our approach relies only on the availability of a bilingual dictionary for translating an English subjectivity lexicon and crowdsourcing for help in selecting seeds, it is more scalable and better able to handle the informality and the dynamic nature of social media. It also can be effectively used to bootstrap sentiment lexicons for any language for which a bilingual dictionary is available or can be automatically induced from parallel corpora."]},{"title":"3 Data","paragraphs":["For the experiments in this paper, we use three sets of data for each language: 1M unlabeled tweets (BOOT) for bootstrapping Twitter-specific lexicons, 2K labeled tweets for development data (DEV), and 2K labeled tweets for evaluation (TEST). DEV is used for parameter tuning while bootstrapping, and TEST is used to evaluating the quality of the bootstrapped lexicons.","We take English tweets from the corpus constructed by Burger et al. (2011) which contains 2.9M tweets (excluding retweets) from 184K users.1","English tweets are identified automatically using a compression-based language identification (LID) tool (Bergsma et al., 2012). Accord-ing to LID, there are 1.8M (63.6%) English tweets, which we randomly sample to create BOOT, DEV and TEST sets for English. Unfortunately, Burger’s corpus does not include Russian and Spanish data on the same scale as English. Therefore, for other languages we construct a new Twitter corpus by downloading tweets from followers of regionspecific news and media feeds.","Sentiment labels for tweets in DEV and TEST sets for all languages are obtained using Amazon Mechanical Turk. For each tweet we collect annotations from five workers and use majority vote to determine the final label for the tweet. Snow et al. (2008) show that for a similar task, labeling emotion and valence, on average four non-expert labelers are needed to achieve an expert level of annotation. Table 1 gives the distribution of tweets over sentiment labels for the development and test sets for English (E-DEV, E-TEST), Spanish (S-DEV, S-TEST), and Russian (R-DEV, R-TEST). Below are examples of tweets in Russian with English translations labeled with sentiment:","• Positive: В планах вкусный завтрак","и куча фильмов (Planning for delicious","breakfast and lots of movies);","• Negative: Хочу сдохнуть, и я это сделаю","(I want to die and I will do that); 1 They provided the tweet IDs, and we used the Twitter","Corpus Tools to download the tweets. 506 Data Positive Neg Both Neutral E-DEV 617 357 202 824 E-TEST 596 347 195 862 S-DEV 358 354 86 1,202 S-TEST 317 387 93 1203 R-DEV 452 463 156 929 R-TEST 488 380 149 983","Table 1: Sentiment label distribution in develop-","ment DEV and test TEST datasets across languages.","• Both: Хочется написать грубее про фильм но не буду.

These terms have been previously shown to be high-precision for recognizing subjective sentences (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).","For the other languages, the subjective seed terms are obtained by translating English seed terms using a bilingual dictionary, and then collecting judgments about term subjectivity from Mechanical Turk. Terms that truly are strongly subjective in translation are used for seed terms in the new language, with term polarity projected from the English. Finally, we expand the lexicons with plurals and inflectional forms for adverbs, adjectives and verbs. 4.2 Bootstrapping Approach To bootstrap, first the new lexicon LB(0) is seeded with the strongly subjective terms from the original lexicon LI . On each iteration i ≥ 1, tweets in the unlabeled data are labeled using the lexicon","2","Other works on generating domain-specific sentiment lexicons e.g., from blog data (Jijkoun et al., 2010) also start with a general, domain-specific lexicon.","3","http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa/ from the previous iteration, LB(i−1). If a tweet contains one or more terms from LB(i−1) it is considered subjective, otherwise objective. The polarity of subjective tweets is determined in a similar way: if the tweet contains ≥ 1 positive terms, taking into account the negation, it is considered negative; if it contains ≥ 1 negative terms, taking into account the negation, it is considered positive.4","If it contains both positive and negative terms, it is considered to be both. Then, for every term not in LB(i−1) that has a frequency ≥ θfreq, the probability of that term being subjective is calculated as shown in Algorithm 1 line 10. The top θk terms with a subjective probability ≥ θpr are then added to LB(i). The polarity of new terms is determined based on the probability of the term appearing in positive or negative tweets as shown in line 18.5 The bootstrapping process terminates when there are no more new terms meeting the criteria to add.

For that we perform subjectivity and polarity classification using rule-based classifiers6","on the test data E-TEST, S-TEST and R-TEST.","We consider how the various lexicons perform for rule-based classifiers for both subjectivity and polarity. The subjectivity classifier predicts that a tweet is subjective if it contains a) at least one, or b) at least two subjective terms from the lexicon. For the polarity classifier, we predict a tweet to be positive (negative) if it contains at least one positive (negative) term taking into account negation. If the tweet contains both positive and negative terms, we take the majority label.","For English we compare our bootstrapped lexicon LE","B against the original lexicon LE","I and strongly subjective terms from SentiWordNet 3.0 (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006).

We could further improve the quality of the lexicon and reduce false negative errors (subjective tweets classified as neutral) by focusing on sentiment-bearing terms such as adjective, adverbs and verbs. However, POS taggers for Twitter are only available for a limited number of languages such as English (Gimpel et al., 2011). Other false negative errors are often caused by misspellings.7 7","For morphologically-rich languages, our approach covers different linguistic forms of terms but not their misspellings. However, it can be fixed by an edit-distance check.","We also find subjective tweets with philosophical thoughts and opinions misclassified, especially in Russian, e.g., Иногда мы бываем не готовы к исполнению заветной мечты но все рав- но так не хочется ее спугнуть (Sometimes we are not ready to fulfill our dreams yet but, at the same time, we do not want to scare them). Such tweets are difficult to classify using lexicon-based approaches and require deeper linguistic analysis.","False positive errors for subjectivity classification happen because some terms are weakly subjective and can be used in both subjective and neutral tweets e.g., the Russian term хвастаться (brag) is often used as subjective, but in a tweet никогда не стоит хвастаться будущим (never brag about your future) it is used as neutral. Similarly, the Spanish term buenas (good) is often used subjectively but it is used as neutral in the follow-ing tweet “@Diveke me falto el buenas! jaja que onda que ha pasado” (I miss the good times we had, haha that wave has passed!).","For polarity classification, most errors happen because our approach relies on either positive or negative polarity scores for a term but not both.8 However, in the real world terms may sometimes have both usages. Thus, some tweets are misclassified (e.g., “It is too warm outside”). We can fix this by summing over weighted probabilities rather than over term counts. Additional errors happen because tweets are very short and convey multiple messages (e.g., “What do you mean by unconventional? Sounds exciting!”) Thus, our approach can be further improved by adding word sense disambiguation and anaphora resolution."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We propose a scalable and language independent bootstrapping approach for learning subjectivity clues from Twitter streams.
