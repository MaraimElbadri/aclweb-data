Unlike prior work on learning language from symbolic input, our input consists of video of people interacting with multiple complex objects in outdoor environments. Unlike prior computer-vision approaches that learn from videos with verb labels or images with noun labels, our labels are sentences containing nouns, verbs, prepositions, adjectives, and adverbs. The correspondence between words and concepts in the video is learned in an unsupervised fashion, even when the video depicts simultaneous events described by multiple sentences or when different aspects of a single event are described with multiple sentences. The learned word meanings can be subsequently used to automatically generate description of new video."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["People learn language through exposure to a rich perceptual context. Language is grounded by mapping words, phrases, and sentences to meaning representations referring to the world. Siskind (1996) has shown that even with referential uncertainty and noise, a system based on cross-situational learning can robustly acquire a lexicon, mapping words to word-level meanings from sentences paired with sentence-level meanings. However, it did so only for symbolic representations of word- and sentence-level meanings that were not perceptually grounded. An ideal system would not require detailed word-level labelings to acquire word meanings from video but rather could learn language in a largely unsupervised fashion, just as a child does, from video paired with sentences.","There has been recent research on grounded language learning. Roy (2002) pairs training sentences with vectors of real-valued features extracted from synthesized images which depict 2D blocks-world scenes, to learn a specific set of features for adjectives, nouns, and adjuncts. Yu and Ballard (2004) paired training images containing multiple objects with spoken name candidates for the objects to find the correspondence between lexical items and visual features. Dominey and Boucher (2005) paired narrated sentences with symbolic representations of their meanings, automatically extracted from video, to learn object names, spatial-relation terms, and event names as a mapping from the grammatical structure of a sentence to the semantic structure of the associated meaning representation. Chen and Mooney (2008) learned the language of sportscasting by determining the mapping between game commentaries and the meaning representations output by a rule-based simulation of the game. Kwiatkowski et al. (2012) present an approach that learns Montague-grammar representations of word meanings together with a combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) from child-directed sentences paired with first-order formulas that represent their meaning.","Although most of these methods succeed in learning word meanings from sentential descriptions they do so only for symbolic or simple visual input (often synthesized); they fail to bridge the gap between language and computer vision, i.e., they do not attempt to extract meaning representations from complex visual scenes. On the other hand, there has been research on training object and event models from large corpora of complex images and video in the computer-vision community (Kuznetsova et al., 2012; Sadanand and Corso, 2012; Kulkarni et al., 2011; Ordonez et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2010). However, most such work requires training data that labels individual concepts with individual words (i.e., ob-53 jects delineated via bounding boxes in images as nouns and events that occur in short video clips as verbs). There is no attempt to model phrasal or sentential meaning, let alone acquire the object or event models from training data labeled with phrasal or sentential annotations. Moreover, such work uses distinct representations for different parts of speech; i.e., object and event recognizers use different representations.","In this paper, we present a method that learns representations for word meanings from short video clips paired with sentences. Our work differs from prior work in three ways. First, our input consists of realistic video filmed in an outdoor environment. Second, we learn the entire lexicon, including nouns, verbs, prepositions, adjectives, and adverbs, simultaneously from video described with whole sentences. Third we adopt a uniform representation for the meanings of words in all parts of speech, namely Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) whose states and distributions allow for multiple possible interpretations of a word or a sentence in an ambiguous perceptual context.","We employ the following representation to ground the meanings of words, phrases, and sentences in video clips. We first run an object detector on each video frame to yield a set of detections, each a subregion of the frame. In principle, the object detector need just detect the objects rather than classify them. In practice, we employ a collection of class-, shape-, pose-, and viewpoint-specific detectors and pool the detections to account for objects whose shape, pose, and viewpoint may vary over time. Our methods can learn to associate a single noun with detections produced by multiple detectors. We then string together detections from individual frames to yield tracks for objects that temporally span the video clip. We associate a feature vector with each frame (detection) of each such track. This feature vector can encode image features (including the identity of the particular detector that produced that detection) that correlate with object class; region color, shape, and size features that correlate with object properties; and motion features, such as linear and angular object position, velocity, and acceleration, that correlate with event properties. We also compute features between pairs of tracks to encode the relative position and motion of the pairs of objects that participate in events that involve two participants. In principle, we can also compute features between tuples of any number of tracks.","Following Yamoto et al. (1992), Siskind and Morris (1996), and Starner et al. (1998), we represent the meaning of an intransitive verb, like jump, as a two-state HMM over the velocity-direction feature, modeling the requirement that the participant move upward then downward. We represent the meaning of a transitive verb, like pick up, as a two-state HMM over both single-object and object-pair features: the agent moving to-ward the patient while the patient is as rest, followed by the agent moving together with the patient. We extend this general approach to other parts of speech. Nouns, like person, can be represented as one-state HMMs over image features that correlate with the object classes denoted by those nouns. Adjectives, like red, round, and big, can be represented as one-state HMMs over region color, shape, and size features that correlate with object properties denoted by such adjectives. Adverbs, like quickly, can be represented as one-state HMMs over object-velocity features. Intransitive prepositions, like leftward, can be represented as one-state HMMs over velocity-direction features. Static transitive prepositions, like to the left of, can be represented as one-state HMMs over the relative position of a pair of objects. Dynamic transitive prepositions, like towards, can be represented as HMMs over the changing distance between a pair of objects. Note that with this formulation, the representation of a verb, like approach, might be the same as a dynamic transitive preposition, like towards. While it might seem like overkill to represent the meanings of words as one-state-HMMs, in practice, we often instead encode such concepts with multiple states to allow for temporal variation in the associated features due to changing pose and viewpoint as well as deal with noise and occlusion. Moreover, the general framework of modeling word meanings as temporally variant time series via multi-state HMMs allows one to model denominalized verbs, i.e., nouns that denote events, as in The jump was fast.","Our HMMs are parameterized with vary-ing arity. Some, like jump(α), person(α), red(α), round(α), big(α), quickly(α), and leftward(α) have one argument, while others, like pick-up(α, β), to-the-left-of(α, β), and towards(α, β), have two arguments (In principle, any arity can be supported.). HMMs are instantiated by mapping their arguments to tracks. This 54 involves computing the associated feature vector for that HMM over the detections in the tracks chosen to fill its arguments. This is done with a two-step process to support compositional semantics. The meaning of a multi-word phrase or sentence is represented as a joint likelihood of the HMMs for the words in that phrase or sentence. Compositionality is handled by link-ing or coindexing the arguments of the conjoined HMMs. Thus a sentence like The person to the left of the backpack approached the trash-can would be represented as a conjunction of person(p0), to-the-left-of(p0, p1), backback(p1), approached(p0, p2), and trash-can(p2) over the three participants p0, p1, and p2. This whole sentence is then grounded in a particular video by mapping these participants to particular tracks and instantiating the associated HMMs over those tracks, by computing the feature vectors for each HMM from the tracks chosen to fill its arguments.","Our algorithm makes six assumptions. First, we assume that we know the part of speech Cm associated with each lexical entry m, along with the part-of-speech dependent number of states Ic in the HMMs used to represent word meanings in that part of speech, the part-of-speech dependent number of features Nc in the feature vectors used by HMMs to represent word meanings in that part of speech, and the part-of-speech dependent feature-vector computation Φc used to compute the features used by HMMs to represent word meanings in that part of speech. Second, we pair individual sentences each with a short video clip that depicts that sentence. The algorithm is not able to determine the alignment between multiple sentences and longer video segments. Note that there is no requirement that the video depict only that sentence. Other objects may be present and other events may occur. In fact, nothing precludes a training corpus with multiple copies of the same video, each paired with a different sentence describing a different aspect of that video. Moreover, our algorithm potentially can handle a small amount of noise, where a video clip is paired with an incorrect sentence that the video does not depict. Third, we assume that we already have (pre-trained) low-level object detectors capable of detecting instances of our target event participants in individual frames of the video. We allow such detections to be unreliable; our method can handle a moderate amount of false positives and false negatives. We do not need to know the mapping from these object-detection classes to words; our algorithm determines that. Fourth, we assume that we know the arity of each word in the corpus, i.e., the number of arguments that that word takes. For example, we assume that we know that the word person(α) takes one argument and the word approached(α, β) takes two arguments. Fifth, we assume that we know the total number of distinct participants that collectively fill all of the arguments for all of the words in each training sentence. For example, for the sentence The person to the left of the backpack approached the trash-can, we assume that we know that there are three distinct objects that participate in the event denoted. Sixth, we assume that we know the argument-to-participant mapping for each training sentence. Thus, for example, for the above sentence we would know person(p0), to-the-left-of(p0, p1), backback(p1), approached(p0, p2), and trash-can(p2). The latter two items can be determined by parsing the sentence, which is what we do. One can imagine learning the ability to automatically perform the latter two items, and even the fourth item above, by learning the grammar and the part of speech of each word, such as done by Kwiatkowski et al. (2012). We leave such for future work.","Figure 1 illustrates a single frame from a potential training sample provided as input to our learner. It consists of a video clip paired with a sentence, where the arguments of the words in the sentence are mapped to participants. From a sequence of such training samples, our learner determines the objects tracks and the mapping from participants to those tracks, together with the meanings of the words.","The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 generally describes our problem of lexical acquisition from video. Section 3 introduces our work on the sentence tracker, a method for jointly tracking the motion of multiple objects in a video that participate in a sententiallyspecified event. Section 4 elaborates on the details of our problem formulation in the context of this sentence tracker. Section 5 describes how to generalize and extend the sentence tracker so that it can be used to support lexical acquisition. We demonstrate this lexical acquisition algorithm on a small example in Section 6. Finally, we conclude with a discussion in Section 7. 55"]},{"title":"1 3 2 0 The person to the left of the backpack carried the trash-can towards the chair.","paragraphs":["α p 0 α p 0 β p 1 α p 1 α p 0 β p 2 α p 2 α p 0 β p 3 α p 3","T","rac","k","3","T","rac","k","0","T","rac","k","1","T","rac","k","2 Figure 1: An illustration of our problem.

We are given a sequence D = (D1, . . . , DR) of video clips Dr, each paired with a sentence Sr from a sequence S = (S1, . . . , SR) of sentences. We refer to Dr paired with Sr as a training sample. Each sentence Sr is a sequence (Sr,1, . . . , Sr,Lr ) of words Sr,l, each an entry from the lexicon. A given entry may potentially appear in multiple sentences and even multiple times in a given sentence. For example, the third word in the first sentence might be the same entry as the second word in the fourth sentence, in which case S1,3 = S4,2. This is what allows cross-situational learning in our algorithm.","Let us assume, for a moment, that we can process each video clip Dr to yield a sequence (τr,1, . . . , τr,Ur ) of object tracks τr,u. Let us also assume that Dr is paired with a sentence Sr = The person approached the chair, specified to have two participants, pr,0 and pr,1, with the mapping person(pr,0), chair(pr,1), and approached(pr,0, pr,1). Let us further assume, for a moment, that we are given a mapping from participants to object tracks, say pr,0 ↦→ τr,39 and pr,1 ↦→ τr,51. This would allow us to instantiate the HMMs with object tracks for a given video clip: person(τr,39), chair(τr,51), and approached(τr,39, τr,51). Let us further assume that we can score each such instantiated HMM and aggregate the scores for all of the words in a sentence to yield a sentence score and further aggregate the scores for all of the sentences in the corpus to yield a corpus score. However, we don’t know the parameters of the HMMs. These constitute the unknown meanings of the words in our corpus which we wish to learn. The problem is to simultaneously determine (a) those parameters along with (b) the object tracks and (c) the mapping from participants to object tracks. We do this by finding (a)–(c) that maximizes the corpus score."]},{"title":"3 The Sentence Tracker","paragraphs":["Barbu et al. (2012a) presented a method that first determines object tracks from a single video clip and then uses these fixed tracks with HMMs to recognize actions corresponding to verbs and construct sentential descriptions with templates. Later Barbu et al. (2012b) addressed the problem of solving (b) and (c), for a single object track constrained by a single intransitive verb, without solving (a), in the context of a single video clip. Our group has generalized this work to yield an algorithm called the sentence tracker which operates by way of a factorial HMM framework. We introduce that here as the foundation of our extension.","Each video clip Dr contains Tr frames. We run an object detector on each frame to yield a set Dt","r of detections. Since our object detector is unreliable, we bias it to have high recall but low precision, yielding multiple detections in each frame. We form an object track by selecting a single detection for that track for each frame. For a moment, let us consider a single video clip with length T , with detections Dt","in frame t. Further, let us assume that we seek a single object track in that video clip. Let jt","denote the index of the detection from Dt","in frame t that is selected to form the track. The object detector scores each detection. Let F (Dt",", jt",") denote that score. More-56 over, we wish the track to be temporally coherent; we want the objects in a track to move smoothly over time and not jump around the field of view. Let G(Dt−1",", jt−1",", Dt",", jt",") denote some measure of coherence between two detections in adjacent frames. (One possible such measure is consistency of the displacement of Dt","relative to Dt−1","with the velocity of Dt−1","computed from the image by optical flow.) One can select the detections to yield a track that maximizes both the aggregate detection score and the aggregate temporal coherence score. max j1 ,...,jT       T ∑ t=1","F (Dt , jt",") + T ∑ t=2","G(Dt−1",", jt−1 , Dt",", jt",")       (1) This can be determined with the Viterbi (1967) algorithm and is known as detection-based tracking (Viterbi, 1971).","Recall that we model the meaning of an intransitive verb as an HMM over a time series of features extracted for its participant in each frame. Let λ denote the parameters of this HMM, (q1",", . . . , qT",") denote the sequence of states qt","that leads to an observed track, B(Dt",", jt",", qt",", λ) denote the conditional log probability of observing the feature vector associated with the detection selected by jt","among the detections Dt","in frame t, given that the HMM is in state qt",", and A(qt−1",", qt",", λ) denote the log transition probability of the HMM.

There may be both a person jumping and a ball rolling. How are we to select one track over the other? The key insight of the sentence tracker is to bias the selection of a track so that it matches an HMM. This is done by combining the cost function of Eq. 1 with the cost function of Eq. 2 to yield Eq. 3, which can also be determined using the Viterbi algorithm. This is done by forming the cross product of the two lattices.

We further need to generalize F so that it computes the joint score of a sequence of detections, one for each track, G so that it computes the joint measure of coherence between a sequence of pairs of detections in two adjacent frames, and B so that it computes the joint conditional log probability of observing the feature vectors associated with the sequence of detections selected by jt",". When doing this, note that Eqs. 1 and 3 maximize over j1",", . . . , jT","which denotes T sequences of detection indices, rather than T individual indices.","It is further straightforward to extend the above to support a sequence (S1, . . . , SL) of words Sl denoting a sentence, each of which applies to different subsets of the multiple tracks, again by forming a larger cross product. When doing so, we generalize qt","to denote a sequence (qt","1, . . . , qt","L) of states qt","l , one for each word l in the sentence, and use ql to denote the sequence (q1","l , . . . , qT","l ) and q to denote the sequence (q1, . . . , qL). We further need to generalize B so that it computes the joint conditional log probability of observing the feature vectors for the detections in the tracks that are assigned to the arguments of the HMM for each word in the sentence and A so that it computes the joint log transition probability for the HMMs for all words in the sentence. This allows selection of an optimal sequence of tracks that yields the highest score for the sentential meaning of a sequence of words. Modeling the meaning of a sentence through a sequence of words whose meanings are modeled by HMMs, defines a factorial HMM for that sentence, since the overall Markov process for that sentence can be factored into inde-57 pendent component processes (Brand et al., 1997; Zhong and Ghosh, 2001) for the individual words. In this view, q denotes the state sequence for the combined factorial HMM and ql denotes the factor of that state sequence for word l.

Towards this end, we define the score of a video clip Dr paired with sentence Sr given the parameter set λ to characterize how well this training sample is explained. While the cost function in Eq. 3 may qualify as a score, it is easier to fit a likelihood calculation into the Baum-Welch framework than a MAP estimate.

The log of the numerator V (Dr, jr) is simply Eq. 1 without the max. The log of the denominator can be computed efficiently by the forward algorithm (Baum and Petrie, 1966). The likelihood for a factorial HMM can be computed as: P (xr|Sr, λ) = ∑ qr ∏ l P (xr,l, qr,l|Sr,l, λ) (5) i.e., summing the likelihoods for all possible state sequences.

As an example of such cross-product occurrence counting, when counting the transitions from state i to k for the lth word from frame t − 1 to t, i.e., ξ(r, l, i, k, t), we need to count all the possible paths through the adjacent factorial states (jt−1","r , qt−1","r,1 , . . . , qt−1","r,Lr )","and (jt","r, qt r,1, . . . , qt","r,Lr ) such that qt−1","r,l = i and qt r,l = k.

It is precisely this dependence that leads to cross-situational learning of two kinds: both inter-sentential and intra-sentential. Acquisition of a word meaning is driven across sentences by entries that appear in more than one training sample and within sentences by the requirement that the meanings of all of the individual words in a sentence be consistent with the collective sentential meaning."]},{"title":"6 Experiment","paragraphs":["We filmed 61 video clips (each 3–5 seconds at 640×480 resolution and 40 fps) that depict a variety of different compound events.

The velocity orientation is quantized into 4 direc-tions: left, up, right, and down. distance We compute the Euclidean distance between the detection centers of two participants, which is quantized into 3 levels: near, normal, and far away. size ratio We compute the ratio of detection area of the first participant to the detection area of the second participant, quantized into 2 possibilities: larger/smaller than. x-position We compute the difference between the x-coordinates of the participants, quantized into 2 possibilities: to the left/right of. The binning process was determined by a preprocessing step that clustered a subset of the training data. We also incorporate the index of the detector that produced the detection as a feature. The particular features computed for each part of speech are given in Table 2.","Note that while we use English phrases, like to the left of, to refer to particular bins of particular features, and we have object detectors which we train on samples of a particular object class such as backpack, such phrases are only mnemonic of the clustering and object-detector training process. We do not have a fixed correspondence between the lexical entries and any particular feature value. Moreover, that correspondence need not be one-to-one: a given lexical entry may correspond to a (time variant) constellation of feature values and any given feature value may participate in the meaning of multiple lexical entries.","We perform a three-fold cross validation, taking the test data for each fold to be the videos filmed in a given outdoor environment and the training data for that fold to be all training samples that contain other videos. For testing, we hand selected 24 sentences generated by the grammar in Table 1, where each sentence is true for at least one test video. Half of these sentences (designated NV) contain only nouns and verbs while the other half (designated ALL) contain other parts of speech. The latter are longer and more complicated than the former. We score each testing video paired with every sentence in both NV and ALL. To evaluate our results, we manually annotated the correctness of each such pair.","Video-sentence pairs could be scored with Eq. 4. However, the score depends on the sentence length, the collective numbers of states and features in the HMMs for words in that sentence, and the length of the video clip. To render the scores comparable across such variation we incorporate a sentence prior to the per-frame score: L̂(Dr, Sr; λ) = [L(Dr; Sr, λ)] 1 Tr","π(Sr) (9)","where π(Sr) = exp Lr ∑ l=1     E(ICS r,l ) +","NC S r,l ∑ n=1","E(ZCS r,l,n)     (10) In the above, ZCS","r,l,n is the number of bins for the nth feature of Sr,l of part of speech CSr,l and E(Y ) = −","∑Y y=1","1","Y log 1","Y = log Y is the entropy","of a uniform distribution over Y bins. This prior","prefers longer sentences which describe more in-","formation in the video. 60","CHANCE BLIND OUR HAND NV 0.155 0.265 0.545 0.748 ALL 0.099 0.198 0.639 0.786 Table 3: F1 scores of different methods. Figure 2: ROC curves of trained models and hand-written models.","The scores are thresholded to decide hits, which together with the manual annotations, can generate TP, TN, FP, and FN counts. We select the threshold that leads to the maximal F1 score on the training set, use this threshold to compute F1 scores on the test set in each fold, and average F1 scores across the folds.","The F1 scores are listed in the column labeled Our in Table 3. For comparison, we also report F1 scores for three baselines: Chance, Blind, and Hand. The Chance baseline randomly classifies a video-sentence pair as a hit with probability 0.5. The Blind baseline determines hits by potentially looking at the sentence but never looking at the video. We can find an upper bound on the F1 score that any blind method could have on each of our test sets by solving a 0-1 fractional programming problem (Dinkelbach, 1967) (see Appendix A for details). The Hand baseline determines hits with hand-coded HMMs, carefully designed to yield what we believe is near-optimal performance. As can be seen from Table 3, our trained models perform substantially better than the Chance and Blind baselines and approach the performance of the ideal Hand baseline. One can further see from the ROC curves in Figure 2, comparing the trained and hand-written models on both NV and ALL, that the trained models are close to optimal. Note that performance on ALL exceeds that on NV with the trained models. This is because longer sentences with varied parts of speech incorporate more in-formation into the scoring process."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We presented a method that learns word meanings from video paired with sentences. Unlike prior work, our method deals with realistic video scenes labeled with whole sentences, not individual words labeling hand delineated objects or events. The experiment shows that it can correctly learn the meaning representations in terms of HMM parameters for our lexical entries, from highly ambiguous training data. Our maximum-likelihood method makes use of only positive sentential labels. As such, it might require more training data for convergence than a method that also makes use of negative training sentences that are not true of a given video. Such can be handled with discriminative training, a topic we plan to address in the future. We believe that this will allow learning larger lexicons from more complex video without excessive amounts of training data."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This research was sponsored by the Army Research Laboratory and was accomplished under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-10-2-0060.
