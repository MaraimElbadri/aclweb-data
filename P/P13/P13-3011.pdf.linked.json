In order to facilitate annotation and to avoid bias, two alternative automatic pre-taggings are presented to the annotator, without reveal-ing which of them is given a higher confidence by the pre-tagging system. The task of the annotator is to select the correct version among these two alternatives. To minimise the instances in which none of the presented pre-taggings is correct, the texts presented to the annotator are actively selected from a pool of unlabelled text, with the selection criterion that one of the presented pre-taggings should have a high probability of being correct, while still being useful for improving the result of an automatic classifier."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["One of the key challenges for many NLP applications is to create the annotated corpus needed for development and evaluation of the application. Such a corpus is typically created through manual annotation, which is a time-consuming task. Therefore, there is a need to explore methods for simplifying the annotation task and for reducing the amount of data that must be annotated.","Annotation can be simplified by automatic pre-annotation, in which the task of the annotator is to improve or correct annotations provided by an existing system. The amount of data needed to be annotated can be reduced by active learning, i.e. by actively selecting data to annotate that is useful to a machine learning system. When using pre-tagged data, the annotator might, however, be biased to choose the annotation provided by the pre-tagger. Also, if the produced pre-taggings are not good enough, it is still a time-consuming task to correct them or select the correct tagging among many suggestions.","Consequently, there is a need to further explore how an annotated corpus can be expanded with less effort and using methods that will not bias the annotators."]},{"title":"2 Background","paragraphs":["The background discusses basic ideas of pre-annotation and active learning, as well as the particular challenges associated with annotating clinical text. 2.1 Annotating clinical text A number of text annotation projects have been carried out in the clinical domain, some of them including annotations of clinical named entities, such as mentions of symptoms, diseases and medication. Such studies have for example been described by Ogren et al. (2008), Chapman et al. (2008), Roberts et al. (2009), Wang (2009), Uzuner et al. (2010), Koeling et al. (2011) and Albright et al. (2013).","As in many specialised domains, expert annotators are typically required to create a reliable annotated clinical corpus. These expert annotators are often more expensive than annotators without the required specialised knowledge. It is also difficult to use crowdsourcing approaches, such as using e.g. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to hire on-line annotators with the required knowledge (Xia and Yetisgen-Yildiz, 2012). A further challenge is posed by the content of the clinical data, which is often sensitive and should therefore only be accessed by a limited number of people. Research community annotation is consequently another option that is not always open to annotation projects in the clinical domain, even if there are examples of such community annotations also for clinical text, e.g. described by Uzuner et al. (2010). 74","To simplify the annotation process, and to minimise the amount of annotated data is therefore even more important for annotations in the clinical domain than for annotation in general. 2.2 Pre-annotation A way to simplify annotation is automatic pre-annotation (or pre-tagging), in which a text is automatically annotated by an existing system, before it is given to the annotator. Instead of annotating unlabelled data, the annotator either corrects mistakes made by this existing system (Chou et al., 2006), or chooses between different taggings provided by the system (Brants and Plaehn, 2000). The system providing the pre-annotations could be rule- or terminology based, not requiring annotated data (Mykowiecka and Marciniak, 2011), as well as a machine learning/hybrid system that uses the annotations provided by the annotator to constantly improve the pre-annotation (Tomanek et al., 2012). There exist several annotation tools that facilitate the use of pre-annotation by allowing the user to import pre-annotations or by providing pre-annotation included in the tools (Neves and Leser, 2012).","A condition for pre-annotation to be useful is that the produced annotations are good enough, or the effect can be the opposite, slowing the annotators down (Ogren et al., 2008). Another potential problem with pre-annotation is that it might bias towards the annotations given by the pre-tagging, for instance if a good pre-tagger reduces the atten-tion of the annotators (Fort and Sagot, 2010). 2.3 Active learning Active learning can be used to reduce the amount of annotated data needed to successfully train a machine learning model. Instead of randomly selecting annotation data, instances in the data that are highly informative, and thereby also highly useful for the machine learning system, are then actively selected. (Olsson, 2008, p. 27).","There are several methods for selecting the most informative instances among the unlabelled ones in the available pool of data. A frequently used method is uncertainty sampling, in which instances that the machine learner is least certain how to classify are selected for annotation. For a model learning to classify into two classes, instances, for which the classifier has no clear preference for one of the two alternatives, are chosen for annotation. If there are more than two classes, the confidence for the most probable class can be used as the measure of uncertainty. Only using the certainty level for the most probable classification means that not all available information is used, i.e. the information of the certainty levels for the less probable classes. (Settles, 2009)","An alternative for a multi-class classifier is therefore to instead use the difference of the certainty levels for the two most probable classes. If cp1 is the most probable class and cp2 is the second most probable class for the observation xn, the margin used for measuring uncertainty for that instance is: Mn = P (cp1|xn) − P (cp2|xn) (1)","An instance with a large margin is easy to classify because the classifier is much more certain of the most probable classification than on the second most probable. Instances with a small margin, on the other hand, are difficult to classify, and therefore instances with a small margin are selected for annotation (Schein and Ungar, 2007). A common alternative is to use entropy as an uncertainty measure, which takes the certainty levels of all possible classes into account (Settles, 2009).","There are also a number of other possible methods for selecting informative instances for annotation, for instance to use a committee of learners and select the instances for which the committee disagrees the most, or to search for annotation instances that would result in the largest expected change to the current model (Settles, 2009).","There are also methods to ensure that the selected data correctly reflects the distribution in the pool of unlabelled data, avoiding a selection of outliers that would not lead to a correct model of the available data. Such methods for structured prediction have been described by Symons et al. (2006) and Settles and Craven (2008).","Many different machine learning methods have been used together with active learning for solving various NLP tasks. Support vector machines have been used for text classification (Tong and Koller, 2002), using properties of the support vector machine algorithm for determining what unlabelled data to select for classification. For structured output tasks, such as named entity recognition, hidden markov models have been used by Scheffer et al. (2001) and conditional random fields (CRF) by Settles and Craven (2008) and Symons et al. (2006). 75","Olsson (2008) suggests combining active learning and pre-annotation for a named entity recognition task, that is providing the annotator with pre-tagged data from an actively learned named entity recogniser. It is proposed not to indiscriminately pre-tagg the data, but to only provide those pre-annotated labels to the human annotator, for which the pre-tagger is relatively certain."]},{"title":"3 Method","paragraphs":["Previous research on pre-annotation shows two seemingly incompatible desirable properties in a pre-annotation system. A pre-annotation that is not good enough might slow the human annotator down, whereas a good pre-annotation might make the annotator lose concentration, trusting the pre-annotation too much, resulting in a biased annotation. One possibility suggested in previous research, is to only provide pre-annotations for which the pre-annotation system is certain of its classification. For annotations of named entities in text, this would mean to only provide pre-tagged entities for which the pre-annotations system is certain. Such a high precision pre-tagger might, however, also bias the human annotator towards not correcting the pre-annotation.","Even more incompatible seems a combination between pre-annotation and active learning, that is to provide the human annotator with pre-tagged data that has been selected for active learning. The data selected for annotation when using active learning, is the data for which the pre-annotator is most uncertain and therefore the data which would be least suitable for pre-annotation.","The method proposed here aims at finding a way of combining pre-annotation and active learning while reducing the risk of annotation bias. Thereby decreasing the amount of data that needs to be annotated as well as facilitating the annotation, without introducing bias. A previous version of this idea has been outlined by Skeppstedt and Dalianis (2012).","The method is focused on the annotation of named entities in clinical text, that is marking of spans of text as well as classification of the spans into an entity class. 3.1 Pre-annotation As in standard pre-annotation, the annotator will be presented with pre-tagged data, and does not have to annotate the data from scratch.","To reduce the bias problem that might be associated with pre-tagging, the mode of presentation will, however, be slightly different in the method proposed here. Instead of presenting the best tagging for the human annotator to correct, or to present the n best taggings, the two best taggings produced by a pre-tagger will be presented, without informing the annotator which of them that the pre-tagger considers most likely.","When being presented with two possible annotations of the same text without knowing which of them that the pre-annotation system considers as most likely, the annotator always has to make an active choice of which annotation to choose. This reduces the bias to one particular pre-annotation, thereby eliminating a drawback associated with standard pre-annotation. Having to consider two alternatives might add cognitive load to the annotator compared to correcting one alternative, but ought to be easier than annotating a text that is not pre-tagged.","The reason for presenting two annotations, as opposed to three or more, is that it is relatively easy to compare two texts, letting your eyes wander from one text to the other, when you have one comparison to make. Having three optional annotations would result in three comparisons, and having four would result in six comparisons, and so on. Therefore, having two optional annotations to choose from, reduces the bias problem while at the same time still offering a method for speeding up the annotation.","A simple Java program for choosing between two alternative pre-annotated sentences has been created (Figure 1). The program randomly chooses in which of the two text boxes to place which pre-annotation. The user can either choose the left or the right annotation, or that none of them is correct.","The data will be split into sentences, and one sentence at time will be presented to the annotator for annotation. 3.2 Active learning To choose from two presented annotations might also potentially be faster than making corrections to one presented annotation. For this to be the case, however, one of the presented annotations has to be a correct annotation. In order to achieve that, the proposed method is to use a version of active learning. 76 Figure 1: A simple program for choosing between two alternative annotations, showing a constructed example in English.","The standard use of active learning is to actively select instances to annotate that are useful to a machine learner. Instances for which the machine learning model can make a confident classification are not presented to the annotator, as these instances will be of little benefit for improving the machine learning system.","The version of active learning proposed here is retaining this general idea of active learning, but is also adding an additional constraint to what instances that are actively selected for annotation. This constraint is to only select text passages for which it is probable that one of the two best pre-taggings is correct, i.e. the pre-tagger has to be confident that one of the two presented pre-annotations is correct, but it should be uncertain as to which one of them is correct.","For ensuring that the sentences selected for annotation are informative enough, the previously described difference of the certainty level of the two most probable classes will be used. The same standard for expressing margin as used in (1), can be used here, except that in (1), cp1 and cp2 stand for classification of one instance, whereas in this case the output is a sequence of labels, labelling each token in a sentence. Therefore, cp1 and cp2 stand for the classification of a sequence of labels.","Let cp1 be the most probable labelling sequence, cp2 the second most probable labelling sequence and cp3 the third most probable labelling sequence. Moreover, let xn be the observations in sentence n, then the following margins can be defined for that sentence: MtoSecond n = P (cp1|xn) − P (cp2|xn) (2) MtoT hird n = P (cp1|xn) − P (cp3|xn) (3)","To make the probability high that one of the two presented pre-annotations is correct, the same method that is used for determining that an annotation instance is informative enough could be used. However, instead of minimising the margin between two classification instances, it is ensured that the margin in high enough. That is, the difference in certainty level between the two most probable annotations and the third most probable must be high enough to make it probable that one of the two best classification candidates is correct. This can be achieved by forcing MtoT hird to be above a threshold, t.","The criteria for selecting the next candidate sentence to annotate can then be described as:","x∗ = argmin","x P (cp1|x) − P (cp2|x) (4) where P (cp1|x) − P (cp3|x) > t","As instances with the highest possible P (cp2|x) in relation to P (cp1|x) are favoured, no threshold for the margin between P (cp2|x) and P (cp3|x) is needed.","It might be difficult to automatically determine an appropriate value of the threshold t. Therefore, the proposed method for finding a good threshold, is to adapt it to the behaviour of the annotator. If the annotator often rejects the two presented pre-taggings, text passages for which the pre-tagger is more certain ought to be selected, that is the value of t ought to be increased. On the other hand, if one of the presented pre-taggings often is selected by the annotator as the correct annotation, the value of t can be decreased, possibly allowing for annotation instances with a smaller MtoSecond. 3.3 Machine learning system As machine learning system, the conditional random fields system CRF++ (Kudo, 2013) will be 77 used. This system uses a combination of forward Viterbi and backward A* search for finding the best classification sequence for an input sentence, given the trained model. It can also produce the n-best classification sequences for each sentence, which is necessary for the proposed pre-tagger that presents the two best pre-taggings to the human annotator.","CRF++ can also give the conditional probably for the output, that is for the entire classification sequence of a sentence, which is needed in the proposed active learning algorithm. 3.4 Materials There is a corpus of Swedish clinical text, i.e. the text in the narrative part of the health record, that contains clinical text from the Stockholm area, from the years 2006-2008 (Dalianis et al., 2009). A subset of this corpus, containing texts from an emergency unit of internal medicine, has been annotated for four types of named entities: disorder, finding, pharmaceutical drug and body structure (Skeppstedt et al., 2012). For approximately one third of this annotated corpus, double annotation has been performed, and the instances, for which there were a disagreement, have been resolved by one of the annotators.","The annotated corpus will form the main source of materials for the study proposed here, and additional data to annotate will be selected from a pool of unlabelled data from internal medicine emergency notes.","The larger subset of the annotated data, only annotated by one annotator, will be referred to as Single (containing 45 482 tokens), and the smaller subset, annotated by two annotators, will be referred to as Double (containing 25 370 to-kens). The Single subset will be the main source for developing the pre-annotation/active learning method, whereas the Double subset will be used for a final evaluation. 3.5 Step-by-step explanation The proposed method can be divided into 8 steps:","1. Train a CRF model with a randomly selected subset of the Single part of the annotated corpus, the seed set. The size of this seed set, as well as suitable features for the CRF model will be evaluated using cross validation on the seed set. The size should be as small as possible, limiting the amount of initial annotation needed, but large enough to have results in line with a baseline system using terminology matching for named entity recognition (Skeppstedt et al., 2012).","2. Apply the constructed CRF model on unlabelled data from the pool of data from internal medicine emergency notes. Let the model, which operates on a sentence level, provide the three most probable label sequences for each sentence, together with its level of certainty.","3. Calculate the difference in certainty between the most probable and the third most probable suggestion sequence for each sentence, that is MtoT hird. Start with a low threshold t and place all sentences with MtoT hird above the threshold t in a list of candidates for presenting to the annotator (that is the sentences fulfilling the criterion P (cp1|x) − P (cp3|x) > t).","4. Order the sentences in the list of selected candidates in increasing order of MtoSecond. Present the sentence with the lowest MtoSecond to the annotator. This is the sentence, for which the pre-tagger is most uncertain of which one of the two most probable pre-taggings is correct. Present the most probable pre-annotation as well as the second most probable pre-annotation, as shown in Figure 1.","5. If the annotator chooses that none of the presented pre-annotations is correct, discard the previous candidate selection and make a new one from the pool with a higher threshold value t. Again, order the sentences in increasing order of MtoSecond, and present the sentence with the lowest MtoSecond to the annotator. Repeat step 3., 4. and 5., gradually increasing the threshold until the annotator accepts one of the presented pre-annotations.","6. Continue presenting the annotator with the two most probable pre-annotations for the sentences in the list of selected candidate sentences, and allow the human annotator to choose one of the pre-annotations. 78 The threshold t could be further adjusted according to how often the option ’None’ is chosen.","7. Each selected annotation is added to a set of annotated data. When a sufficiently large amount of new sentences have been added to this set, the model needs to be retrained with the new data. The retraining of the model can be carried out as a background process while the human annotator is annotating. In order to use the annotator time efficiently, there should not be any waiting time while retraining.","8. When the model has been retrained, the process starts over from step 2. 3.6 Evaluation The text passages chosen in the selection process will, as explained above, be used to re-train the machine learning model, and used when selecting new text passages for annotation. The effect of adding additional annotations will also be constantly measured, using cross validation on the seed set. The additional data added by the active learning experiments will, however, not be used in the validation part of the cross validation, but only be used as additional training data, in order to make sure that the results are not improved due to easily classified examples being added to the corpus.","When an actively selected corpus of the same size as the entire Single subset of the corpus has been created, this actively selected corpus will be used for training a machine learning model. The performance of this model will then be compared to a model trained on the single subset. Both models will be evaluated on the Double subset of the corpus. The hypothesis is that the machine learning model trained on the corpus partly created by pre-tagging and active learning will perform better than the model created on the original Single subset."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion","paragraphs":["A method that combines pre-annotation and active learning, while reducing annotation bias, is proposed. A program for presenting pre-annotated data to the human annotator for selection has been constructed, and a corpus of annotated data suitable as a seed set and as evaluation data has been constructed. The active learning part of the proposed method remains, however, to be implemented.","Applying the proposed methods aims at creat-ing a corpus suitable for training a machine learning system to recognise the four entities Disorder, Finding, Pharmaceutical drug and Body structure. Moreover, methods for facilitating annotated corpus construction will be explored, potentially adding new knowledge to the science of annotation."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["I am very grateful to the reviewers and the presubmission mentor for their many valuable comments.
