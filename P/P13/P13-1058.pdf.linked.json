We first replace inflected forms by their stems or lemmas: building a translation system on a stemmed representation of the target side leads to a simpler translation task, and the morphological information contained in the source and target language parts of the translation model is more balanced. In the second step, the stemmed output of the translation is then inflected: the morphological features are predicted, and the inflected forms are generated using the stem and predicted morphological features.","In this paper, we focus on improving case prediction for noun phrases (NPs) in German translations. The NP feature case is extremely difficult to predict in German: while the NP features gender and number are part of the stem or can be derived from the source-side input, respectively, the prediction of case requires information about the subcategorization of the entire clause. This is due to German being a less configurational language than English, which encodes grammatical relations (e.g. subject-hood, object-hood, etc.) through the position of constituents. German sentences exhibit a freer constituent order, and thus case is an important indicator of the grammatical functions of noun phrases. Correct case prediction is a crucial factor for the adequacy of SMT output, cf. the example in table 1 providing an erroneously inflected output (this is taken from a baseline “simple inflection prediction” system, cf. section 5.2). The translation of the English input sentence in terms of stems is perfectly acceptable; after the inflection step, however, the translation of NP4 ongoing military actions represents a genitive modifier of the subject NP2, instead of a direct object NP of the verb anordnen (to order). The meaning is thus why the government of the ongoing military actions ordered, which has only one NP and is completely wrong.","The translation in table 1 needs verb subcategorization information. This is demonstrated by the invented examples (1) and (2):","(1) [Der Mitarbeiter]NPnom hat [den Bericht]NPacc [dem Kollegen]NPdat gegeben. [The employee]NPnom gave [his colleague]NPdat [the report]NPacc","(2) [Der Mitarbeiter]NPnom hat [dem Bericht]NPdat [des Kollegen]NPgen zugestimmt. [The employee]NPnom agreed [on the report]PP [of his colleague]PP Both inflected sentences rely on the stem sequence","[d Mitarbeiter] [d Bericht] [d Kollege] ⟨verb⟩, so the case assignment can only be determined by the verb: While geben ( to give) has a strong preference for selecting a ditransitive subcategorization frame1",", including an agentive subject (nomi-","1","A ditransitive verb takes a subject and two objects. 593 input [why]1 [the government]2 [ordered]3 [the ongoing military actions]4 output stemmed [warum]1 [d Regierung]2 [d anhaltend militärisch Aktion]4 [angeordnet]3","inflected [warum]1 [die Regierung]2 [der anhaltenden militärischen Aktionen]4 [angeordnet]3 Table 1: Example for case confusion in SMT output when using a simple prediction system. native case), a benefactive (dative case) and a patient (accusative case), zustimmen (to agree) has a strong preference for only selecting an agentive subject (nominative case) and an indirect object theme (dative case). So in the latter case the NP [d Kollege] cannot receive case from the verb and is instead the genitive modifier of the dative NP.","While for examples (1) and (2) knowledge about the syntactic verb subcategorization functions is sufficient to correctly predict the NP cases, examples (3) to (6) require subcategorization information at the syntax-semantic interface. (3) [Der Mitarbeiter]NPnom hat [dem Kollegen]NPdat","[den Bericht]NPacc gegeben.","(4) [Der Mitarbeiter]NPnom hat [den Bericht]NPacc [dem Kollegen]NPdat gegeben.","(5) [Dem Kollegen]NPdat hat [der Mitarbeiter]NPnom [den Bericht]NPacc gegeben.","(6) [Den Bericht]NPacc hat [der Mitarbeiter]NPnom [dem Kollegen]NPdat gegeben. In all four examples, the verb and the participat-ing noun phrases Mitarbeiter (employee), Kollege (colleague) and Bericht (report) are identical, and the noun phrases are assigned the same case. However, given that the stemmed output of the translation does not tell us anything about case features, in order to predict the appropriate cases of the three noun phrases, we either rely on ordering heuristics (such that the nominative NP is more likely to be in the beginning of the sentence (the German Vorfeld) than the accusative or dative NP, even though all three of these would be grammatical), or we need fine-grained subcategorization information beyond pure syntax. For example, both Mitarbeiter and Kollege would satisfy the agentive subject role of the verb geben better than Bericht, and Bericht is more likely to be the patient of geben.","The contribution of this paper is to improve the prediction of case in our SMT system by implementing and combining two alternative routes to integrate subcategorization information from the syntax-semantic interface: (i) We regard the translation as a function of the source language input, and project the syntactic functions of the English nouns to their German translations in the SMT output. This subcategorization model is necessary when there are several plausible solutions for the syntactic functions of a noun in combination with a verb. For example, both Mitarbeiter and Kollege are plausible subjects and direct objects of the verb geben, so the information about these nouns’ roles in the input sentence allows for disambiguation. (ii) The case of an NP is derived from an external knowledge base comprising quantitative, dependency-based information about German verb subcategorization frames and noun modification. The verb subcategorization information is not restricted to syntactic noun functions but models association strength for verb– noun pairs with regard to the entire subcategorization frame plus the syntactic functions of the nouns. For example, the database can tell us that while the verb geben is very likely to subcategorize a ditransitive frame, the verb zustimmen is very likely to subcategorize only a direct object, next to the obligatory subject (subcat frame prediction). Furthermore, we can retrieve the information that the noun Bericht is less likely to appear as subject of geben than the nouns Mitarbeiter and Kollege (verb–noun subcat case prediction). And we can look up that the noun Aktion is very unlikely to be a genitive modification of Regierung (cf. table 1), while Kollege is a plausible genitive modification of Bericht (noun–noun modification case prediction, cf. example (2)).","In summary, model (i) applies when there are no obvious preferences concerning verb–noun subcategorization or noun–noun modification. Model (ii) predicts case relying on the subcategorization and modification preferences. The combination of our two models approaches a simplified level of semantic role definition but only relies on dependency information that is considerably easier and cheaper to define and obtain than a very high quality semantic parser and/or a corpus annotated with semantic role information. Integrating semantic role information into SMT has been demonstrated by various researchers to improve translation quality (cf. Wu and Fung (2009a), Wu and Fung (2009b), Liu and Gildea (2008), Liu and Gildea (2010)). Our approach is in line with 594 Wu and Fung (2009b) who demonstrated that on the one hand 84% of verb syntactic functions in a 50-sentence test corpus projected from Chinese to English, and that on the other hand about 15% of the subjects were not translated into subjects, but their semantic roles were preserved across language. These two findings correspond to the expected uses of our models (i) and (ii), respectively."]},{"title":"2 Previous work","paragraphs":["Previous work has already introduced the idea of generating inflected forms as a post-processing step for a translation system that has been stripped of (most) target-language-specific features. Toutanova et al. (2008) and Jeong et al. (2010) built translation systems that predict inflected word forms based on a large array of morphological and syntactic features, obtained from both source and target side. Kholy and Habash (2012) and Green and DeNero (2012) work on English to Arabic translation and model gender, number and definiteness, focusing primarily on improving fluency.","Fraser et al. (2012) used a phrase-based system to transfer stems and generated inflected forms based on the stems and their morphological features. For case prediction, they trained a CRF with access to lemmas and POS-tags within a given window. We re-implemented the system by Fraser et al. as a hierarchical machine translation system using a string-to-tree setup. In contrast to the flat phrase-based setting of Fraser et al. (2012), syntactic trees on the SMT output allow us to work with verb–noun structures, which are relevant for case prediction. While the CRF used for case prediction in Fraser et al. (2012) has access to lexical information, it is limited to a certain window size and has no direct information about the relation of verb–noun pairs occurring in the sentence. Using a window of a limited size is particularly problematic for German, as there can be large gaps between the verb and its subcategorized nouns; in-troducing information about the relation of verbs and nouns helps to bridge such gaps. Furthermore, that model was not able to make effective use of source-side features.","One of the objectives of using an inflection prediction model is morphologically well-formed output. Kirchhoff et al. (2012) evaluated user re-actions to different error types in machine translation and came to the result that morphological well-formedness has only a marginal impact on the comprehensibility of SMT output in the case of English-Spanish translation. As already discussed, German case is essential to the meaning of the sentence, so this result will not hold for German output."]},{"title":"3 Translation pipeline","paragraphs":["This section presents an overview of our two-step translation process. In the first step, English input is translated to German stems. In the second step, morphological features are predicted and inflected forms are generated based on the word stems and the morphological features. In subsec-tions 3.1 to 3.4, we present the simple version of the inflection prediction system; our new features are described in sections 4.2 and 4.3. 3.1 Stemmed representation/feature markup We first parse the German side of the parallel training data with BitPar (Schmid, 2004). This maps each surface form appearing in normal text to a stem and morphological features (case, gender, number). We use this representation to create the stemmed representation for training the translation model. With the exception of stem-markup (discussed below), all morphological features are removed from the stemmed representation. The stem markup is used as part of the input to the feature prediction; the basic idea is that the given feature values are picked up by the prediction model and then propagated over the phrase.","Nouns, as the head of NPs and PPs, are annotated with gender and number. We consider gender as part of the stem, whereas the value for number is derived from the source-side: if marked for number, singular/plural nouns are distinguished during word alignment and then translated accordingly. Prepositions are also annotated with case; many prepositions are restricted to only one case, some are ambiguous and allow for either dative or accusative. Other words which are subject to feature prediction (e.g. adjectives, articles) are reduced to their stems with no feature markup, as are all remaining words. As sole exception, we keep the inflected forms of verbs (verbal inflection is not modelled). In addition to the translation model, the target-side language model, as well as the reference data for parameter tuning use this representation. 595 3.2 Building a stemmed translation model We use a hierarchical translation system. Instead of translating phrases, a hierarchical system extracts translation rules (Galley et al., 2004) which allow the decoder to provide a tree spanning over the translated sentence. In order to avoid sparsity during rule extraction, we use a string-to-tree setup, where only the target-side part of the data is parsed. Translation rules are of the following form: [X]1 allows [X]2 → [NP]1 [NP]2 erlaubt [X]1 allows [X]2 → [NP]1 erlaubt [NP]2 This example illustrates how rules can cover the different word ordering possibilities in German.","PP nodes are annotated with their respective case, as well as with the lemma of the preposition they contain. In our experiments, this enriched annotation has small improvements over the simpler setting with only head categories (details omitted). This outcome, in particular that adding the lemma of the preposition to the PP node helps to improve translation quality, has been observed be-fore in tree restructuring work for improving translation (Huang and Knight, 2006).","3.3 Feature prediction and generation of inflected forms In this section we discuss our focus, which is prediction of case, but also the prediction of number, gender and strong/weak adjectival inflection. The latter feature is German-specific; its values2 (strong/weak) depend on the combination of the other features, as well as on the type of determiner (e.g. definite/indefinite/none).","Morphological features are predicted on four separate CRF models, one for each feature. The models for case, number and gender are independent of another, whereas the model for adjectival inflection requires information about these features, and is thus the last one to be computed, tak-ing the output of the 3 other models as part of its input. In contrast, the adjectival inflection model in Fraser et al. (2012) is independent from the other features. Each model has access to stems, POS-tags and the feature to be modelled within a window of four positions to the right and the left of the current position3",". 2 Note that the values for strong/weak inflection are not","always the same over the phrase, but follow a certain pattern","depending on the settings of case, number and gender. 3 Preliminary experiments showed that larger windows do","not improve translation quality.","Table 2 illustrates the different steps of the inflection process: the markup (number and gender on nouns) in the stemmed output of the SMT system is part of the input to the respective feature prediction. For gender and number, the values given on the stems of the nouns are then propagated over the phrase. While the case of prepositional phrases is determined by the case annotation on prepositions, the case of nominal phrases is computed only based on the respective contexts. After predicting all morphological features, the information required to generate inflected forms is complete: based on the stems and the features, we use the morphological tool SMOR (Schmid et al., 2004) for the generation of inflected forms.","One general problem with feature-prediction is that the ill-formed SMT output is not well represented by the training data which consists of well-formed sentences. This problem was also mentioned by Stymne and Cancedda (2011) and Kholy and Habash (2012). They deal with this problem by translating the training data and annotating it with the respective features, and then adding this new data set to the original training data. As this method comes with its own problems, such as transferring the morphological annotation to not necessarily isomorphically translated text, we do not use translated data as part of the training data. Instead, we limit the power of the CRF model through experimenting with the removal of features, until we had a system that was robust to this problem. 3.4 Dealing with word formation issues To reduce data sparsity, we split portmanteau prepositions. Portmanteaus are compounds of prepositions and articles, e.g. zur = zu der (to the). Being components of nominal phrases, they have to agree in all morphological features with the rest of the phrase. As only some combinations of articles and prepositions can form a portmanteau, the decision of whether to merge prepositions and articles is made after feature prediction. Since our focus is case prediction, we do not do special modelling of German compounds."]},{"title":"4 Using subcategorization information","paragraphs":["Within the area of (automatic) lexical acquisition, the definition of lexical verb information has been a major focus, because verbs play a central role for the structure and the meaning of sentences and 596 SMT output predicted features inflected forms gloss beeinflussen<VVFIN> – beeinflussen influence d<ART> Fem.Acc.Sg.St die the politisch<ADJ> Fem.Acc.Sg.Wk politische political Stabilität<NN><Fem><Sg> Fem.Acc.Sg.Wk Stabilität stability Table 2: Overview of the inflection process: the stem markup is highlighted in the SMT output. discourse. On the one hand, this has led to a range of manually or semi-automatically developed lexical resources focusing on verb information, such as the Levin classes (Levin, 1993), VerbNet (Kipper Schuler, 2006), FrameNet4","(Fillmore et al., 2003), and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005). On the other hand, we find automatic approaches to the induction of verb subcategorization information at the syntax-semantics interface for a large number of languages, e.g. Briscoe and Carroll (1997) for English; Sarkar and Zeman (2000) for Czech; Schulte im Walde (2002a) for German; Messiant (2008) for French. This basic kind of verb knowledge has been shown to be useful in many NLP tasks such as information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003; Venturi1 et al., 2009), parsing (Carroll et al., 1998; Carroll and Fang, 2004) and word sense disambiguation (Kohomban and Lee, 2005; Mc-Carthy et al., 2007). 4.1 Extracting subcategorization information As described in the introductory section, we make use of two5","major kinds of subcategorization information. Verb–noun tuples referring to specific syntactic functions within verb subcategorization (verb–noun subcat case prediction) are integrated with an associated probability for accusative (direct object), dative (indirect object) and nominative (subject).6","Further to the subject and object noun phrases, the subcategorization information provides quantitative triples for verb–preposition–noun pairs, thus predicting the case of NPs within prepositional phrases (we do this only when the prepositions are ambiguious, i.e., they could subcategorize either a dative or an accusative NP). In addition to modelling subcategorization information, it is also important to differentiate between subcategorized noun phrases (such as object or subject), and noun phrases","4","Even though the FrameNets approach does not only include knowledge about verbal predicates, the actual lexicons are skewed towards verb behaviour.","5","The third kind of information, subcat frame prediction is implicit, since verb–noun tuples rely on specific frames.","6","Genitive objects can also occur in German verb subcategorization frames, but this is extremely rare and verb-specific and thus not considered in our model.","V-SUBJ V-OBJAcc V-OBJDat EP 454,350 332,847 53,711 HGC 712,717 329,830 160,377 Both 1,089,492 607,541 206,764 Table 3: Number of verb-noun types extracted from Europarl (EP) and newspaper data (HGC). that modify nouns (noun–noun modification case prediction). Typically, these NP modifiers are genitive NPs. To this end, we integrate noun-nounGen tuples with their respective frequencies. These preferences for a certain function (i.e. subject, object or modifier) are passed on to the system at the level of nouns and integrated into the CRF through the derived probabilities.","The tuples and triples are obtained from dependency-parsed data by extracting all occur-rences of the respective relations; table 3 gives an overview of the number of extracted tuple types. For the subcategorization information, the verb-noun tuples (verb-subject, verb-objectAcc, verb-objectDat) are then grouped as follows: tuple gloss Acc Dat Nom SchemaN folgenV pattern follow 0 322 19 We compute the probabilities for the verb-noun tuple to occur in the respective functions based on the relative frequencies. In the case of SchemaN folgenV , we find that the function ofSchema as dative object is predominant (to follow a pattern), but it can also occur in the subject position (the pattern follows). The fact that two functions are possible for this noun are reflected in their probabilities. The probabilities are discretized into 5 buckets (Bp=0, B0<p≤0.25, B0.25<p≤0.5, B0.5<p≤0.75, B0.75<p≤1). In contrast, noun modification in noun-nounGen construction is represented by co-occurrence frequencies.7","7","The frequencies are bucketed to the powers of ten, i.e. f = 1, 2 ≤ f ≤ 10, 11 ≤ f ≤ 100 , etc. and also f = 0: this representation allows for a more fine-grained distinction in the low-to-mid frequency range, providing a good basis for the decision of whether a given noun-noun pair is a true noun-nounGen structure or just a random co-occurrence of two nouns. 597","Gloss Stem Tag Acc Dat Nom Verb Gen N1 Gold 1 companies Unternehmen<NN> NN 0.00 0.00 1.00 erhalten – – Nom 2 should sollten<VVFIN> VVFIN – – – – – – – 3 financial finanziell<ADJ> ADJ – – – – – – Acc 4 funding Mittel<NN> NN 1.00 0.00 0.00 erhalten – – Acc 5 for für APPR<Acc> PRP – – – – – – – 6 the d<ART> ART – – – – – – Acc 7 introduction Einführung<NN> NN – – – – – – Acc 8 new neu<ADJ> ADJ – – – – – – Gen 9 technologies Technologie<NN> NN – – – – 100 Einführung<NN> Gen 10 obtain erhalten<VVINF> VVINF – – – – – – – Table 4: Adding subcategorization information into SMT output.

On the right, the correct labels are given. 4.2 Integrating subcategorization knowledge There are two possibilities to integrate subcategorization information into the case prediction model: (i) It can be integrated into the data set using the tree-structure provided by the decoder. Here, verb-noun tuples are extracted from VP and S structures, and then the probabilities for the different functions are looked up. Similarly, for two adjacent NPs, the occurrence frequencies of the respective two nouns are looked up in the list of noun-nounGen constructions. (ii) The subcategorization information can be integrated based on the verb-noun tuples obtained by using tuples obtained from source-side dependencies.","The classification task of the CRF consists in predicting a sequence of labels: case values for NPs/PPs or no value otherwise, cf. table 4. The model has access to the basic features stem and tag, as well as the new features based on subcat-egorizaion information (explained below), using unigrams within a window of up to four positions to the right and the left of the current position, as well as bigrams and trigrams for stems and tags (current item + left and/or right item).","An example for integrating subcategorization features is given in table 4. The first word Unternehmen (companies) is annotated as subject of erhalten (obtain) with probability 1, and Mittel (funding) is annotated as direct object of erhalten with probability 1.

As can be seen in the example in table 4, the subject (line 1) and the verb (line 10) are far apart from each other. By providing the parts of the tuple as unigrams, bigrams or trigrams to the CRF, all relevant information is available: verb, noun and the probabilities for the potential functions of the noun in the sentence. In addition to bridging the long distance between verbs and subcategorized nouns, a very common problem for German, this type of precise information also helps to close the gap between the well-formed training data and the broken SMT-output as it replaces to a certain extent the target-language context information (n-grams of stems or lemmas within a small window). 4.3 Integrating source-side features For predicting case in SMT output, information about an NP’s function in the input sentence is essential. Syntax-semantic functions can be isomorphic (e.g., English subjects and objects may have the same function in a German translation), but this is not necessarily the case. Despite this, an important advantage of integrating source-side features is that the well-formed source-side text can be reliably parsed, whereas SMT output is often disfluent and cannot be reliably parsed.","The English features are obtained from dependency-parsed data (Choi and Palmer, 2012). The relevant annotation of the parser is transferred 598 to the SMT output via word alignment. We focus on English subjects, direct objects and noun-of-noun structures (often equivalent to noun-nounGen phrases on the German side): these structures are generally likely to correspond to each other within source and target language. In contrast to the subcategorization-based information, the difference between well-formed training data and disfluent SMT output tends to work to our benefit here: while the parallel sentences of the training data were manually translated with the objective to produce good target-language sentences, the syntactic structures of the source and target sentences are often diverging. In contrast, the SMT system often produces more isomorphic translations, which is helpful for annotating source-side features on the target language.","Figure 1 shows the process of integrating source-side features: for each German noun that is aligned with an English noun labelled as subject or direct object, this annotation is transferred to the target-side. Using the English dependency structures, the verb subcategorizing the respective noun is identified, and via the alignment, the equivalent German verb is obtained. Similarly, candidates for noun-nounGen structures are identified by extracting and aligning English noun-of-noun phrases."]},{"title":"5 Experiments and evaluation","paragraphs":["In this section, we present experiments using different feature combinations. We also present a manual evaluation of our best system which shows that the new features improve translation quality. 5.1 Data and experimental setup We use the hierarchical translation system that comes with the Moses SMT-package and GIZA++ to compute the word alignment, using the “growdiag-final-and” heuristics.

We choose this particular data combination in order to provide data that matches the training data, as well as to add new data of the test set’s domain (news). The German part of Europarl was dependency-parsed with Bohnet (2010), and subcategorization information was extracted as described in Scheible et al. (2013); the newspaper data (HGC - Huge German Corpus) was parsed with Schmid (2000), and subcategorization information was extracted as described in Schulte im Walde (2002b). 5.2 Results We report results of two types of systems (table 5): first, a regular translation system built on surface forms (i.e., normal text) and second, four inflection prediction systems. The first inflection prediction system (1) uses a simple case prediction model, whereas the remaining systems are enriched with (2) subcategorization information (cf. section 4.2), (3) source-side features (cf. section 4.3), and (4) both source-side features and subcategorization information. In (2) and (4), the subcategorization information was included using tuples obtained from source-side dependencies11",". The simple prediction system corresponds to that presented in section 3; for all inflection prediction systems, the same SMT output and models for number, gender and strong/weak inflection were used; thus the only difference with the simple prediction system is the model for case prediction.","We present three types of evaluation: BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2001), prediction accuracy on clean data and a manual evaluation of the best system in section 5.3.","Table 5 gives results in case-insensitive BLEU.

As we are working on improving adequacy, this will not be fully reflected by BLEU. Furthermore, not all components of an NP do necessarily change their inflection with a new case value; it might happen that the only indicator for the case of an NP is the determiner: er sieht [den alten Mann]NP acc (he sees the old man) vs. er folgt [dem alten Mann]NP dat (he follows the old man). While the case marking of NPs is essential for comprehensibility, one changed word per noun phrase is hardly enough to be reflected by BLEU.","An alternative to study the effectiveness of the case prediction model is to evaluate the prediction accuracy on parsed clean data, i.e. not on SMT output.

This shows that the additional features improve the model, but also that a gain in prediction accuracy on clean data is not necessarily related to a gain in BLEU.

Related to this problem, we observed that high-order n-gram POS/lemma-based features in the simple prediction (sequences of lemmas and tags) are given too much weight in training and thus make it difficult for the new features to have a larger impact, so we restricted the n-gram order of this type of feature to trigrams. 5.3 Manual evaluation of the best system In order to provide a better understanding of the impact of the presented features, in particular to see whether there is an improvement in adequacy, we carried out a manual evaluation comparing sys-","13","The numbers in table 5 are artificially high and downplay the difference as they also include cases which are very easy to predict, such as nouns in PPs where only one value for case is possible.

From the set of different sentences between the simple prediction system and the enriched system (144 of 1026), we evaluated those where the English input sentence was between 8 and 25 words long (46 sentences in total). We specifically restricted the test set in order to provide sentences which are less difficult to annotate, as longer sentences are often very disfluent and too hard to rate. Most of the sentences in the evaluation set differ only in the realization of one NP. For comparing the two systems, the sentences were presented in random order to 3 native speakers of German.","The evaluation consists of two parts: first, the participants were asked to decide which sentence is better without being given the English input (this measures fluency). In the second part, they should to mark that sentence which better reproduces the content of the English input sentence (this measures adequacy). The test set is the same for both tasks, the only difference being that the English input is given in the second part. The results are given in table 6. Summarizing we can say that the participants prefer the enriched system over the simple system in both parts; there is a high agreement (17 cases) in decisions over those sentences which were rated as enriched better.","When looking at the pairwise inter-annotator agreement for the task of annotating the test-set with the 3 possible labels enriched preferred, simple preferred and no preference, we find that the annotators P1 and P2 have a substantial agreement 600 input hundreds of policemen were on alert , and [a helicopter]Subj circled the area with searchlights .","1 simple Hunderte von Polizisten auf Trab , und [einen Helikopter]Acc eingekreist das Gebiet mit searchlights . enriched Hunderte von Polizisten auf Trab , und [ein Helikopter]Nom eingekreist das Gebiet mit searchlights . input while 38 %percent put [their trust]Obj in viktor orbán .","2 simple während 38 % [ihres Vertrauens]Gen schenken in Viktor Orbán . enriched während 38 % [ihr Vertrauen]Acc schenken in Viktor Orbán . input more than $ 100 billion will enter [the monetary markets]Obj by means of public sales .","3 simple mehr als 100 Milliarden Dollar werden durch öffentlichen Verkauf [der Geldmärkte]Gen treten . enriched mehr als 100 Milliarden Dollar werden durch öffentlichen Verkauf [die Geldmärkte]Acc treten . Table 7: Output from the simple system (1) and the enriched system (4). in terms of Kappa (κ = 0.6184), whereas the agreement of P3 with P1/P2 respectively leads to lower scores (κ = 0.4467 and κ = 0.3596). However, the annotators tend to agree well on sentences with the label enriched preferred, but largely disagree on sentences labelled as either simple preferred or no preference. The number of decisions where all three annotators agree on a label when given the English input is listed in table 6(c): for example, only two sentences were given the label baseline is better by all three annotators. This outcome shows how difficult it is to rate disfluent SMT output. For evaluating the case prediction system, the distinction between enriched preferred and enriched dis-preferred is the most important question to answer. Redefining the annotation task to annotating only two values by grouping the labels simple preferred and no preference into one annotation possibility leads to κ = 0.7391, κ = 0.4048 and κ = 0.5652. 5.4 Examples Table 7 shows some examples for output from the simple system and the system using source-side and subcategorization features. In the first sentence, the subject NP a helicopter was inflected as a direct object in the simple system, but as a subject in the enriched system, which was preferred by all three annotators. In the second sentence, the NP their trust, i.e. a direct object of put, was incorrectly predicted as genitive-modifier of 38 % (i.e. 38 % of their trust) in the simple system. The enriched system made use of the preference for accusative for the pair Vertrauen schenken (place trust), correctly inflecting this NP as direct object. Interestingly, only two annotators preferred the enriched system, whereas one was undecided. The third sentence illustrates how difficult it is to rate case marking on disfluent SMT output: there are two possibilities to translate enter the money market; the direct equivalent of the English phrase (den GeldmarktAcc betreten), or via the use of a prepositional phrase (auf den GeldmarktAcc treten: “ to step into the money market”). The SMT-output contains a mix of both, i.e. the verb treten (instead of betreten), but without the preposition, which cannot lead to a fully correct inflection. While the inflection of the simple system (a genitive construction meaning the public sales of the money market) is definitely wrong, the inflection obtained in the enriched system is not useful either, due to the structure of the translation14",". This difficulty is also reflected by the annotators, who gave twice the label no preference and once the label enriched better."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We illustrated the necessity of using external knowledge sources like subcategorization information for modelling case for English to German translation. We presented a translation system making use of a subcategorization database together with source-side features. Our method is language-independent with regard to the source language; furthermore, no language-specific high-quality semantic annotation is needed for the target language, but the data required to model the subcategorization preferences can be obtained using standard NLP techniques. We showed in a manual evaluation that the proposed features have a positive impact on translation quality."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work was funded by the DFG Research Project Distributional Approaches to Semantic Relatedness (Marion Weller), the DFG Heisenberg Fellowship SCHU-2580/1-1 (Sabine Schulte im Walde), as well as by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft grant Models of Morphosyntax for Statistical Machine Translation (Alexander Fraser). 14 Furthermore, with treten being polysemous, die","Geldmärkte treten can also mean to kick the money markets. 601"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Bernd Bohnet. 2010.
