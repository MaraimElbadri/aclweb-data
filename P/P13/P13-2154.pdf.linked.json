Judgments from individual subjects in our study exhibit high average correlation to the resulting relatedness means (r = 0.77, σ = 0.09, N = 73), although not as high as Resnik’s (1995) upper bound for expected average human correlation to similarity means (r = 0.90). This suggests that human perceptions of relatedness are less strictly constrained than perceptions of similarity and establishes a clearer expectation for what constitutes human-like performance by a computational measure of semantic relatedness. We compare the results of several WordNet-based similarity and relatedness measures to our Rel-122 norms and demonstrate the limitations of WordNet for discovering general indications of semantic relatedness. We also offer a critique of the field’s reliance upon similarity norms to evaluate relatedness measures."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Despite the well-established technical distinc-tion between semantic similarity and relatedness (Agirre et al., 2009; Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006; Resnik, 1995), comparison to established similarity norms from psychology remains part of the standard evaluative procedure for assessing computational measures of semantic relatedness. Because similarity is only one particular type of relatedness, comparison to similarity norms fails to give a complete view of a relatedness measure’s efficacy.","In keeping with Budanitsky and Hirst’s (2006) observation that “comparison with human judgments is the ideal way to evaluate a measure of similarity or relatedness,” we have undertaken the creation of a new set of relatedness norms."]},{"title":"2 Background","paragraphs":["The similarity norms of Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965; henceforth R&G) and Miller and Charles (1991; henceforth M&C) have seen ubiquitous use in evaluation of computational measures of semantic similarity and relatedness.","R&G established their similarity norms by presenting subjects with 65 slips of paper, each of which contained a pair of nouns. Subjects were directed to read through all 65 noun pairs, then sort the pairs “according to amount of ‘similarity of meaning.’” Subjects then assigned similarity scores to each pair on a scale of 0.0 (completely dissimilar) to 4.0 (strongly synonymous).","The R&G results have proven to be highly replicable. M&C repeated R&G’s study using a subset of 30 of the original word pairs, and their resulting similarity norms correlated to the R&G norms at r = 0.97. Resnik’s (1995) subsequent replication of M&C’s study similarly yielded a correlation of r = 0.96. The M&C pairs were also included in a similarity study by Finkelstein et al. (2002), which yielded correlation of r = 0.95 to the M&C norms. 2.1 WordSim353 WordSim353 (Finkelstein et al., 2002) has recently emerged as a potential surrogate dataset for evaluating relatedness measures. Several studies have reported correlation to WordSim353 norms as part of their evaluation procedures, with some studies explicitly referring to it as a collection of human-assigned relatedness scores (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007; Hughes and Ramage, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008). 890","Yet, the instructions presented to Finkelstein et al.’s subjects give us pause to reconsider WordSim353’s classification as a set of relatedness norms. They repeatedly framed the task as one in which subjects were expected to assign word similarity scores, although participants were instructed to extend their definition of similarity to include antonymy, which perhaps explains why the authors later referred to their data as “relatedness” norms rather than merely “similarity” norms.","Jarmasz and Szpakowicz (2003) have raised further methodological concerns about the construc-tion of WordSim353, including: (a) similarity was rated on a scale of 0.0 to 10.0, which is intrinsically more difficult for humans to manage than the scale of 0.0 to 4.0 used by R&G and M&C, and (b) the inclusion of proper nouns introduced an element of cultural bias into the dataset (e.g., the evaluation of the pair Arafat–terror).","Cognizant of the problematic conflation of similarity and relatedness in WordSim353, Agirre et al. (2009) partitioned the data into two sets: one containing noun pairs exhibiting similarity, and one containing pairs of related but dissimilar nouns. However, pairs in the latter set were not assessed for scoring distribution validity to ensure that strongly related word pairs were not penalized by human subjects for being dissimilar.1"]},{"title":"3 Methodology","paragraphs":["In our experiments, we elicited human ratings of semantic relatedness for 122 noun pairs. In doing so, we followed the methodology of Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965) as closely as possible: participants were instructed to read through a set of noun pairs, sort them by how strongly related they were, and then assign each pair a relatedness score on a scale of 0.0 (“completely unrelated”) to 4.0 (“very strongly related”).","We made two notable modifications to the experimental procedure of Rubenstein and Goodenough. First, instead of asking participants to judge “amount of ‘similarity of meaning,’” we asked them to judge “how closely related in mean-ing” each pair of nouns was. Second, we used a Web interface to collect data in our study; instead of reordering a deck of cards, participants were presented with a grid of cards that they were able 1","Perhaps not surprisingly, the highest scores in WordSim353 (all ratings from 9.0 to 10.0) were assigned to pairs that Agirre et al. placed in their similarity partition. to rearrange interactively with the use of a mouse or any touch-enabled device, such as a tablet PC.2 3.1 Experimental Conditions Each participant in our study was randomly assigned to one of four conditions. Each condition contained 32 noun pairs for evaluation.","Of those pairs, 10 were randomly selected from from WordNet++ (Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010) and 10 from SGN (Szumlanski and Gomez, 2010)—two semantic networks that categorically indicate strong relatedness between WordNet noun senses. 10 additional pairs were generated by randomly pairing words from a list of all nouns occurring in Wikipedia. The nouns in the pairs we used from each of these three sources were matched for frequency of occurrence in Wikipedia.","We manually selected two additional pairs that appeared across all four conditions: leaves–rake and lion–cage. These control pairs were included to ensure that each condition contained examples of strong semantic relatedness, and potentially to help identify and eliminate data from participants who assigned random relatedness scores. Within each condition, the 32 word pairs were presented to all subjects in the same random order. Across conditions, the two control pairs were always presented in the same positions in the word pair grid.","Each word pair was subjected to additional scrutiny before being included in our dataset. We eliminated any pairs falling into one or more of the following categories: (a) pairs containing proper nouns, (b) pairs in which one or both nouns might easily be mistaken for adjectives or verbs, (c) pairs with advanced vocabulary or words that might require domain-specific knowledge in or-der to be properly evaluated, and (d) pairs with shared stems or common head nouns (e.g., first cousin–second cousin and sinner–sinning). The latter were eliminated to prevent subjects from latching onto superficial lexical commonalities as indicators of strong semantic relatedness without reflecting upon meaning. 3.2 Participants Participants in our study were recruited from in-troductory undergraduate courses in psychology and computer science at the University of Central Florida. Students from the psychology courses","2","Online demo: http://www.cs.ucf.edu/∼seansz/rel-122 891 participated for course credit and accounted for 89% of respondents.","92 participants provided data for our study. Of these, we identified 19 as outliers, and their data were excluded from our norms to prevent interference from individuals who appeared to be assign-ing random scores to noun pairs. We considered an outlier to be any individual whose numeric ratings fell outside two standard deviations from the means for more than 10% of the word pairs they evaluated (i.e., at least four word pairs, since each condition contained 32 word pairs).","For outlier detection, means and standard deviations were computed using leave-one-out sampling. That is, data from individual J were not in-corporated into means or standard deviations when considering whether to eliminate J as an outlier.3","Of the 73 participants remaining after outlier elimination, there was a near-even split between males (37) and females (35), with one individual declining to provide any demographic data. The average age of participants was 20.32 (σ = 4.08, N = 72). Most students were freshmen (49), followed in frequency by sophomores (16), seniors (4), and juniors (3). Participants earned an average score of 42% on a standardized test of advanced vocabulary (σ = 16%, N = 72) (Test I – V-4 from Ekstrom et al. (1976))."]},{"title":"4 Results","paragraphs":["Each word pair in Rel-122 was evaluated by at least 20 human subjects. After outlier removal (described above), each word pair retained evaluations from 14 to 22 individuals. The resulting relatedness means are available online.4","An excerpt of the Rel-122 norms is shown in Table 1. We note that the highest rated pairs in our dataset are not strictly similar entities; exactly half of the 10 most strongly related nouns in Table 1 are dissimilar (e.g., digital camera–photographer).","Judgments from individual subjects in our study exhibited high average correlation to the elicited relatedness means (r = 0.769, σ = 0.09, N = 73).

Presumably Resnik’s subjects had advanced knowledge of what constitutes semantic similarity, as he established r = 0.90 as an upper bound for expected human correlation on that task.","The fact that average human correlation in our study is weaker than in previous studies suggests that human perceptions of relatedness are less strictly constrained than perceptions of similarity, and that a reasonable computational measure of relatedness might only approach a correlation of r = 0.769 to relatedness norms.","In Table 2, we present the performance of a variety of relatedness and similarity measures on our new set of relatedness means.5","Coefficients of correlation are given for Pearson’s product-moment correlation (r), as well as Spearman’s rank correlation (ρ).

Each condition again had 32 noun pairs: 15 from M&C and 17 from Rel-122. Pairs from M&C and Rel-122 were uniformly distributed between these two new conditions based on matched normative similarity or relatedness scores from their respective datasets.","Results from this second phase of our study are shown in Table 3. The correlation of our relatedness means on this set to the similarity means of M&C was strong (r = 0.91), but not as strong as in replications of the study that asked subjects to evaluate similarity (e.g. r = 0.96 in Resnik’s (1995) replication and r = 0.95 in Finkelstein et al.’s (2002) M&C subset).","That the synonymous M&C pairs garner high relatedness ratings in our study is not surprising; strong similarity is, after all, one type of strong relatedness. The more interesting result from 893 our study, shown in Table 3, is that relatedness norms for pairs that are related but dissimilar (e.g., journey–car and forest–graveyard) deviate significantly from established similarity norms. This in-dicates that asking subjects to evaluate “similarity” instead of “relatedness” can significantly impact the norms established in such studies."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have established a new set of relatedness norms, Rel-122, that is offered as a supplementary evaluative standard for assessing semantic relatedness measures.","We have also demonstrated the shortcomings of using similarity norms to evaluate such measures. Namely, since similarity is only one type of relatedness, comparison to similarity norms fails to provide a complete view of a measure’s abil-ity to capture more general types of relatedness. This is particularly problematic when evaluating WordNet-based measures, which naturally excel at capturing similarity, given the nature of the WordNet ontology.","Furthermore, we have found that asking judges to evaluate “relatedness” of terms, rather than “similarity,” has a substantive impact on resulting norms, particularly with respect to the M&C similarity dataset. Correlation of individual judges’ ratings to resulting means was also significantly lower on average in our study than in previous studies that focused on similarity (e.g., Resnik, 1995). These results suggest that human perceptions of relatedness are less strictly constrained than perceptions of similarity and validate the need for new relatedness norms to supplement existing gold standard similarity norms in the evaluation of relatedness measures."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Eneko Agirre, Enrique Alfonseca, Keith Hall, Jana Kravalova, Marius Pasça, and Aitor Soroa. 2009.
