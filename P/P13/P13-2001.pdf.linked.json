Arabic speakers generally use dialects in daily interactions. There are 6 dominant dialects, namely Egyptian, Moroccan, Levantine, Iraqi, Gulf, and Yemeni1",".

For example, the letter “q” is typically pronounced in MSA as an unvoiced uvular stop (as the “q” in “quote”), but as a glottal stop in Egyptian and Levantine (like “A” in “Alpine”) and a voiced velar stop in the Gulf (like “g” in “gavel”). Differing pronunciations often reflect on spelling.","Social media platforms allowed people to express themselves more freely in writing. Although MSA is used in formal writing, dialects are in-creasingly being used on social media sites. Some notable trends on social platforms include (Darwish et al., 2012): - Mixed language texts where bilingual (or multilingual) users code switch between Arabic and English (or Arabic and French).

In this work, we focused on translating dialectal Egyptian to English us-1 ing Egyptian to MSA adaptation. Unlike previous work, we first narrowed the gap between Egyptian and MSA using character-level transformations and word n-gram models that handle spelling mistakes, phonological variations, and morphological transformations. Later, we applied an adaptation method to incorporate MSA/English parallel data.","The contributions of this paper are as follows: – We trained an Egyptian/MSA transformation model to make Egyptian look similar to MSA. We publicly released the training data. – We built a phrasal Machine Translation (MT) system on adapted Egyptian/English parallel data, which outperformed a non-adapted baseline by 1.87 BLEU points. – We used phrase-table merging (Nakov and Ng, 2009) to utilize MSA/English parallel data with the available in-domain parallel data."]},{"title":"2 Previous Work","paragraphs":["Our work is related to research on MT from a resource poor language (to other languages) by pivoting on a closely related resource rich language. This can be done by either translating between the related languages using word-level translation, character level transformations, and language specific rules (Durrani et al., 2010; Hajič et al., 2000; Nakov and Tiedemann, 2012), or by concatenating the parallel data for both languages (Nakov and Ng, 2009). These translation methods generally require parallel data, for which hardly any exists between dialects and MSA. Instead of translating between a dialect and MSA, we tried to narrow down the lexical, morphological and phonetic gap between them using a character-level conversion model, which we trained on a small set of parallel dialect/MSA word pairs.","In the context of Arabic dialects3",", most previous work focused on converting dialects to MSA and vice versa to improve the processing of dialects (Sawaf, 2010; Chiang et al., 2006; Mohamed et al., 2012; Utiyama and Isahara, 2008). Sawaf (2010) proposed a dialect to MSA normalization that used character-level rules and morphological analysis. Salloum and Habash (2011) also used a rule-based method to generate MSA paraphrases of dialectal out-of-vocabulary (OOV) and low frequency words. Instead of rules, we automatically 3 Due to space limitations, we restrict discussion to work","on dialects only. learnt character mappings from dialect/MSA word pairs.","Zbib et al. (2012) explored several methods for dialect/English MT. Their best Egyptian/English system was trained on dialect/English parallel data. They used two language models built from the English GigaWord corpus and from a large web crawl. Their best system outperformed manually translating Egyptian to MSA then translating using an MSA/English system. In contrast, we showed that training on in-domain dialectal data irrespective of its small size is better than training on large MSA/English data. Our LM experiments also affirmed the importance of in-domain English LMs. We also showed that a conversion does not imply a straight forward usage of MSA resources and there is a need for adaptation which we fulfilled using phrase-table merging (Nakov and Ng, 2009). 2.1 Baseline We constructed baselines that were based on the following training data: - An Egyptian/English parallel corpus consisting of ≈38k sentences, which is part of the LDC2012T09 corpus (Zbib et al., 2012). We randomly divided it into 32k sentences for training, 2k for development and 4k for testing. We henceforth refer to this corpus as EG and the English part of it as EGen. We did not have access to the training/test splits of Zbib et al. (2012) to directly compare to their results. - An MSA/English parallel corpus consisting of 200k sentences from LDC4",". We refer to this corpus as the AR corpus.","For language modeling, we used either EGen or the English side of the AR corpus plus the English side of NIST12 training data and English GigaWord v5. We refer to this corpus as GW.","We tokenized Egyptian and Arabic according to the ATB tokenization scheme using the MADA+TOKAN morphological analyzer and to-kenizer v3.1 (Roth et al., 2008). Word elongations were already fixed in the corpus. We word-aligned the parallel data using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), and symmetrized the alignments using grow-diag-final-and heuristic (Koehn et al., 2003). We trained a phrasal MT system (Koehn et al., 2003).

The system trained on AR (B1) performed poorly compared to the one trained on EG (B2) with a 6.75 BLEU points difference. This highlights the difference between MSA and Egyptian.

For later comparison, we only use the B4 baseline."]},{"title":"3 Proposed Methods 3.1 Egyptian to","paragraphs":["EG′ Conversion As mentioned previously, dialects differ from MSA in vocabulary, morphology, and phonology. Dialectal spelling often follows dialectal pronunciation, and dialects lack standard spelling conventions. To address the vocabulary problem, we used the EG corpus for training.","To address the spelling and morphological differences, we trained a character-level mapping model to generate MSA words from dialectal ones using character transformations. To train the model, we extracted the most frequent words from a dialectal Egyptian corpus, which had 12,527 news comments (containing 327k words) from Al-Youm Al-Sabe news site (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011) and translated them to their equivalent MSA words. We hired a professional translator, who generated one or more translations of the most frequent 5,581 words into MSA. Out of these word pairs, 4,162 involved character-level transformations due to phonological, morphological, or spelling changes. We aligned the translated pairs at character level using GIZA++ and Moses in the manner described in Section 2.1. As in the baseline of Kahki et al. (2011), given a source word, we produced all of its possible segmentations along with their associated character-level mappings. We restricted individual source character sequences to be 3 characters at most. We retained all mapping sequences leading to valid words in a large lexicon. We built the lexicon from a set of 234,638 Aljazeera articles5","that span a 10 year period and contain 254M tokens. Spelling mistakes in Aljazeera articles were very infrequent. We sorted the candidates by the product of the constituent mapping probabilities and kept the top 10 candidates. Then we used a trigram LM that we built from the aforementioned Aljazeera articles to pick the most likely candidate in context. We simply multiplied the character-level transformation probability with the LM probability – giv-ing them equal weight. Since Egyptian has a “ne pas” like negation construct that involves putting a “"]},{"title":"—","paragraphs":["” and “ ” at the beginning and end of verbs, we handled words that had negation by remov-ing these two letters, then applying our character transformation, and lastly adding the negation article “lA”"]},{"title":"B","paragraphs":["before the verb.

In order to maximize the gain using both parallel corpora, we used the phrase merging technique described in Nakov and Ng (2009) to merge the phrase tables generated from the AR and EG′","corpora. If a phrase occurred in both phrase tables, we 5 http://www.aljazeera.net 3 adopted one of the following three solutions: - Only added the phrase with its translations and their probabilities from the AR phrase table.

In particular, using a morphological analyzer seeems like a promising possibility. One approach could be to run a morphological analyzer for dialectal Arabic (e.g. MADA-ARZ (Habash et al., 2013)) on the original EG sentence and another analyzer for MSA (such as MADA) on the converted EG′ sentence, and then to compare the morphological features. Discrepancies should be probabilistically incorporated in the conversion. Exploring this approach is left for future work."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We presented an Egyptian to English MT system.
