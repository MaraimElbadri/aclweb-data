MSA is the language used in education, scripted speech and official settings while DA is the native tongue of Arabic speakers. Arabic dialects may be divided into five main groups: Egyptian (including Libyan and Sudanese), Levantine (including Lebanese, Syrian, Palestinian and Jordanian), Gulf, Iraqi and Moroccan (Maghrebi) (Habash, 2010). Even though these dialects did not originally exist in a written form, they are pervasively present in social media text (normally mixed with MSA) nowadays. DA does not have a standard orthography leading to many spelling variations and inconsistencies. Linguistic Code switching (LCS) between MSA and DA happens both intra-sententially and intersententially. LCS in Arabic poses a serious challenge for almost all NLP tasks since MSA and DA differ on all levels of linguistic representation. For example, MSA trained tools perform very badly when applied directly to DA or to a code-switched DA-MSA text. Hence a need for a robust dialect identification tool as a preprocessing step arises both on the word and sentence levels.","In this paper, we focus on the problem of dialect identification on the sentence level. We propose a supervised approach for identifying whether a given sentence is prevalently MSA or Egyptian DA (EDA). The system uses the approach that was presented in (Elfardy et al., 2013) to perform token dialect identification. The token level decisions are then combined with other features to train a generative classifier that tries to predict the class of the given sentence. The presented system out-performs the approach presented by Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2011) on the same dataset using 10-fold cross validation."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Dialect Identification in Arabic is crucial for almost all NLP tasks, yet most of the research in Arabic NLP, with few exceptions, is targeted to-wards MSA. Biadsy et al. (2009) present a system that identifies dialectal words in speech and their dialect of origin through the acoustic signals. Salloum and Habash (2011) tackle the problem of DA to English Machine Translation (MT) by pivoting through MSA. The authors present a system that applies transfer rules from DA to MSA then uses state of the art MSA to English MT system. Habash et al. (2012) present CODA, a Conventional Orthography for Dialectal Arabic that aims to standardize the orthography of all the variants of DA while Dasigi and Diab (2011) present an unsupervised clustering approach to identify orthographic variants in DA. Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2011) crawl a large dataset of MSA-DA news’ commentaries. The authors annotate part of the dataset for sentence-level dialectalness on 456 Amazon Mechanical Turk and try a language modeling (LM) approach to solve the problem. In Elfardy and Diab (2012a), we present a set of guidelines for token-level identification of dialectalness while in (Elfardy and Diab, 2012b), (Elfardy et al., 2013) we tackle the problem of token-level dialect-identification by casting it as a code-switching problem."]},{"title":"3 Approach to Sentence-Level Dialect Identification","paragraphs":["We present a supervised system that uses a Naive Bayes classifier trained on gold labeled data with sentence level binary decisions of either being MSA or DA. 3.1 Features The proposed supervised system uses two kinds of features: (1) Core Features, and (2) Meta Features. 3.1.1 Core Features: These features indicate how dialectal (or non dialectal) a given sentence is. They are further divided into: (a) Token-based features and (b) Perplexity-based features. 3.1.1.1 Token-based Features: We use the approach that was presented in (Elfardy et al., 2013) to decide upon the class of each word in the given sentence. The aforementioned approach relies on language models (LM) and MSA and EDA Morphological Analyzer to decide whether each word is (a) MSA, (b) EDA, (c) Both (MSA & EDA) or (d) OOV. We use the token-level class labels to estimate the percentage of EDA words and the percentage of OOVs for each sentence. These percentages are then used as features for the proposed model. The following variants of the underlying token-level system are built to assess the effect of varying the level of preprocessing on the underlying LM on the performance of the overall sentence level dialect identification process: (1) Surface, (2) Tokenized, (3) CODAfied, and (4) Tokenized-CODA.

We use the implementation of CODA presented in CODAfy (Eskander et al., 2013), to build an orthography-normalized LM.

The first of which is a majority baseline (Maj-BL); that assigns all the sentences the label of the most frequent class observed in the training data. The second baseline (Token-BL) assumes that the sentence is EDA if more than 45% of its tokens are dialectal otherwise it assumes it is MSA.3","The third baseline (Ppl-BL) runs each sentence through MSA & EDA LMs and assigns the sentence the class of the LM yielding the lower perplexity value.
