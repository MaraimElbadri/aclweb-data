In this paper, we propose a working definition of thwarting amenable to machine learning and create a system that detects if the document is thwarted or not. We focus on identifying thwarting in product reviews, especially in the camera domain. An ontology of the camera domain is created. Thwarting is looked upon as the phenomenon of polarity reversal at a higher level of ontology compared to the polarity expressed at the lower level. This notion of thwarting defined with respect to an ontology is novel, to the best of our knowledge. A rule based implementation building upon this idea forms our baseline. We show that machine learning with annotated corpora (thwarted/non-thwarted) is more effective than the rule based system. Because of the skewed distribution of thwarting, we adopt the Area-under-the-Curve measure of performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at the difficult problem of thwarting detection, which we hope will at least provide a baseline system to compare against."]},{"title":"1 Credits","paragraphs":["The authors thank the lexicographers at Center for Indian Language Technology (CFILT) at IIT Bombay for their support for this work."]},{"title":"2 Introduction","paragraphs":["Although much research has been done in the field of sentiment analysis (Liu et al., 2012), thwarting and sarcasm are not addressed, to the best of our knowledge. Thwarting has been identified as a common phenomenon in sentiment analysis (Pang et al., 2002, Ohana et al., 2009, Brooke, 2009) in various forms of texts but no previous work has proposed a solution to the problem of identifying thwarting. We focus on identifying thwarting in product reviews.","The definition of an opinion as specified in Liu (2012) is","“An opinion is a quintuple, ( , , , , ), where is the name of an entity, is an aspect of , is the sentiment on aspect of entity , is the opinion holder, and is the time when the opinion is expressed by .”"," If the sentiment towards the entity or one of its important attribute contradicts the sentiment towards all other attributes, we can say that the document is thwarted."]},{"title":"Ankit Ramteke Dept. of Computer Science & Engg., Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India. ankitr@cse.iitb.ac.in  Pushpak Bhattacharyya Dept. of Computer Science & Engg., Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India. pb@cse.iitb.ac.in  Akshat Malu Dept. of Computer Science & Engg., Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India. akshatmalu@cse.iitb.ac.in  J.

Subsumption in this hierarchy implies that the child is a part or feature of the parent. Domain ontology has been used by various works in NLP (Saggion et al., 2007 and Polpinij et al., 2008). In our work, we use domain ontology of camera. We look upon thwarting as the phenomenon of reversal of polarity from the lower level of the ontology to the higher level. At the higher level of ontology the entities mentioned are the whole product or a large critical part of the product. So while statements about entities at the lower level of the ontology are on “details”, statements about entities at higher levels are on the “big picture”. Polarity reversal from details to the big picture is at the heart of thwarting.","The motivation for our study on thwarting comes from the fact that: a) Thwarting is a challenging NLP problem and b) Special ML machinery is needed in view of the fact that the training data is so skewed. Additionally large amount of world and domain knowledge maybe called for to solve the problem. In spite of the relatively fewer occurrence of the thwarting phenomenon the problem poses an intellectually stimulating exercise. We may also say that in the limit, thwarting approaches the very difficult problem of sarcasm detection (Tsur et al. 2010).","We start by defining and understanding the problem of thwarting in section 2. In section 3, we describe a method to create the domain ontology. In section 4, we propose a naïve rule based approach to detect thwarting. In section 5 we discuss a machine learning based approach which could be used to identify whether a document is thwarted or not. This is followed by experimental results in section 6. Section 7 draws conclusions and points to future work."]},{"title":"3 Definition","paragraphs":["Thwarting is defined by Pang et al., (2008) as follows: “Thwarted expectations basically refer to the phenomenon wherein the author of the text first builds up certain expectations for the topic, only to produce a deliberate contrast to the earlier discussion.\""," For our computational purposes, we define thwarting as: “The phenomenon wherein the overall polarity of the document is in contrast with the polarity of majority of the document.”  This definition emphasizes thwarting as piggybacking on sentiment analysis to improve the latter’s performance. The current work however only addresses the problem of whether a document is thwarted or not and does not output the sentiment of the document. The basic block diagram for our system is shown in figure 1.","","","","",""," Figure 1: Basic Block Diagram"," An example of a thwarted document is: “I love the sleek design. The lens is impressive. The pictures look good but, somehow this camera disappoints me. I do not recommend it.”"," While thwarting occurs in various forms of sentiment bearing texts, it is not a very frequent one. It accounts for hardly 1-2% of any given corpus. Thus, it becomes hard to find sufficient number of examples of thwarting to train a classifier.","Since thwarting is a complex natural language phenomenon we require basic NLP tools and resources, whose accuracy in turn can affect the overall performance of a thwarting detection system."]},{"title":"4 Building domain ontology","paragraphs":["Domain ontology comprises of features and entities from the domain and the relationships between them. The process thus has two steps, viz. (a) identify the features and entities, and (b) connect them in the form of a hierarchy. We decided to use a combination of review corpora mining and manual means for identifying key features. Our approach to building the domain ontology is as follows:","Step 1: We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) on a corpus containing reviews of a particular product (camera, in our case) to identify key features from the domain. The output is then analyzed manually to finally select the key features. Some additional features get added by human annotator to increase the coverage of the ontology. For Example, in the camera domain, the corpus may include words Thwarting Detection System","Input Document Thwarted or Not -Thwarted 861   like memory, card, gb, etc. but, may not contain the word storage. The abstract concept of storage is contributed by the human annotator through his/her world knowledge.","Step 2: The features thus obtained are arranged in the form of a hierarchy by a human annotator.","  Figure 2: Ontology for the camera domain"]},{"title":"5 A rule based approach to thwarting recognition","paragraphs":["As per the definition of thwarting, most of the thwarted document carries a single sentiment; however, a small but critical portion of the text, carrying the contrary sentiment, actually decides the overall polarity. The critical statement, thus, should be strongly polar (either positive or negative), and it should be on some critical feature of the product. From the perspective of the domain ontology, the sentiment towards the overall product or towards some critical feature mentioned near the root of the ontology should be opposite to the sentiment towards features near the leaves."," Based on these observations we propose the following naïve approach to thwarting detection:"," For each sentence in a review to be tested 1. Get the dependency parse of the sentence. This step is essential. It makes explicit the adjective noun dependencies, which in turn uncovers the sentiment on a specific part or feature of the product. 2. Identify the polarities towards all nouns, using the dependency parse and sentiment lexicons. 3. If a domain feature, identified using the domain ontology, exists in the sentence, annotate/update the ontology node, containing the feature, using the polarity obtained.","Once the entire review is processed, we obtain the domain ontology, with polarity marking on nodes, for the corresponding review.","The given review is thwarted if there is a contradiction of sentiment among different levels of the domain ontology with polarity marking on nodes.","The sentiment lexicons used are SentiWord-Net (Esuli et al., 2006), Taboada (Taboada et al., 2004), BL lexicon (Hu et al., 2004) and Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966).","The procedure is illustrated by an example. “I love the sleek design. The lens is impressive. The pictures look good but, somehow this camera disappoints me. I do not recommend it.”"," A part of the ontology, with polarity marking on nodes, for this example is shown in figure 3."," Figure 3: ontology with polarity marking on nodes:","example Based on this ontology we see that there is an opposition of sentiment between the root (“camera”) and the lower nodes. We thus determine that this document is thwarted.","However, since the nodes, within the same level, might have different weighting based upon the product under consideration, this method fails to perform well. For example, the body and video capability might be subjective whereas any fault in the lens or the battery will render the camera useless, hence they are more critical. We thus see a need for relative weighting among all features in the ontology. Camera - negative Lens - positive","Body Design - positive","Display Picture - positive 862  "]},{"title":"6 A Machine Learning based approach","paragraphs":["Manual fixing of relative weightages for the features of the product is possible, but that would be ad hoc. We now propose a machine learning based approach to detect thwarting in documents. It uses the domain ontology to identify key features related to the domain. The approach in-volves two major steps namely learning the weights and building a model that classifies the reviews using the learnt weights. 6.1 Learning Weights The weights are learnt using the lossregularization framework. The key idea is that the overall polarity of the document is determined by the polarities of individual words in the document. Since, we need to find the weights for the nodes in the domain ontology; we consider only the words belonging to the ontology for further processing. Thus, if P is the polarity of the review and is the polarity associated with word i then ∑ gives the linear model. The word i should belong to the ontology as well as the review. Similarly, the hinge loss is given by","where w is the weight vector and x is the feature vector consisting of .","Based on the intuition, that every word contributes some polarity to its parent node in the domain ontology, we also learnt weights on the ontology by percolating polarities towards the root. We experimented with complete percolation, wherein the polarity at a node is its polarity in the document summed with the polarities of all its descendants. We also define controlled percolation, wherein the value added for a particular descendant is a function of its distance from the node. We halved the polarity value percolated, for each edge between the two nodes. Thus, for the example in figure 2, the polarity value of camera would be ","  ","  ","  ","  ","  ","Where is the final polarity for camera and is the polarity of the word ε {camera, body, display, design, picture}. 6.2 Classifier We use the SVM classifier with features generated using the following steps. We first create a vector of weighted polarity values for each review. This is constructed by generating a value for each word in the domain ontology encountered while reading the review sequentially. The value is calculated by multiplying the weight, found in the previous step (5.1), with the polarity of the word as determined from the sentence. Since, these vectors will be of different dimensionality for each review, we extract features from these reviews. These features are selected based on our understanding of the problem and the fact that thwarting is a function of the change of polarity values and also the position of change. The Features extracted are: Document polarity, number of flips of sign (i.e. change of polarity from positive to negative and vice versa), the maximum and minimum values in a sequence, the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of positive values (LCSP), the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of negative values (LCSN), the mean of all values, total number of positive values in the sequence, total number of negative values in the sequence, the first and the last value in the sequence, the variance of the moving averages, the difference in the means of LCSP and LCSN."]},{"title":"7 Results","paragraphs":["Experiments were performed on a dataset obtained by crawling product reviews from Amazon 1 . We focused on the camera domain. We","obtained 1196 reviews from this domain. The","reviews were annotated for thwarting, i.e.,","thwarted or non-thwarted as well as polarity. The","reviews crawled were given to three different","annotators. The instructions given for annotation","were as follows: 1.

The annotators showed high agreement (98%) in the non-thwarted class whereas they agreed on 70% of the thwarted documents.","Out of the 1196 reviews, exactly 21 were thwarted documents, agreed upon by all annotators. We used the Stanford Core NLP tools","2"," (Klein et al., 2003, Toutanova et al., 2003) for basic NL processing. The system was tested on the entire dataset.","Since, the data is highly skewed; we used Area under the Curve (AUC) for the ROC curve as the measure of evaluation (Ling et al., 2003). The AUC for a random baseline is expected to be 50%, and the rule based approach is close to the baseline (56.3%).","Table 1 shows the results for the experiments with the machine learning model. We used the CVX3","library in Matlab to solve the optimization problem for learning weights and the LIBSVM","4"," library to implement the svm classifier. In order to account for the data skew, we assign a class weight of 50 (determined empirically) to the thwarted instances and 1 for non-thwarted instances in the classifier. All results were obtained using a 10 fold cross validation. The same dataset was used for this set of experiments.","","Loss type","for","weights Percolation type for weights AUC value for classification Linear Complete 73% Controlled 81% Hinge Complete 70% Controlled 76% ","Table 1: Results of the machine learning based approach to thwarting detection  We see that the overall system for identification of thwarting performs well for the weights obtained using the linear model with a controlled percolation of polarity values in the ontology. The system outperforms both the random baseline as well as the rule based system. These results though great are to be taken with a pinch of salt. The basic objective for creating a thwarting detection system was to include such a module in the general sentiment analysis framework. Thus, using document polarity as a feature contradicts the objective of sentiment analysis, which is to find the document polarity.

The parts of the product are related to one another through an ontology. This ontology guides a rule based approach to thwarting detection, and also provides features for an SVM based learning system. The ML based system scores over the rule based system. Future work consists in trying out the approach across products and across domains, doing better ontology harnessing from the reviews and investing and searching for distributions and learning algorithms more suitable for the problem."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Blei, D.
