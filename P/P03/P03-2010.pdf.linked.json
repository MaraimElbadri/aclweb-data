Meanwhile, there is a significant divergence in opinions whether time adverbials or tense/aspect is a more efficient indicator leading to a correct temporal representation of sentences. To some [Kim, 1981], [Jo, 2000], [Vet, 1980], [Verkyul, 1989], tense or aspect is the only credible index to consult in establishing temporal interpretation, and the time adverbials are complementary. To others [Renaud, 1996], [Vlach, 1993], time adverbials are regarded as much more reliable than tense/aspect which is too ambiguous to provide coherent instructions about how to locate the event in time. We agree with the second point of view, as we observed that Korean tense markers fail to provide a solid and coherent way to capture the relevant time span. For example, the verbal infix ‘-at-’, generally considered as a typical past tense marker in Korean, brings about several time interpretation possibilities such as simple past (3), completion (4), resultant state (5) and progressiveness (6).

Moreover, what triggers these interpretation possibilities is still being discussed among Korean linguists 2 . ","In the following, we attempt to show how time adverbials can remedy this shortcoming and specify the event time. "]},{"title":"2 Semantic description","paragraphs":["The assumption underlying our temporal description is that the linguistic time is ordered, discrete, infinite and consisting of instants corresponding to the natural numbers. The linguistic time can be expressed with one of these three notions: instant, extended interval and duration. Instants are unitary constituents of linguistic time and noted by a quintuplet of natural numbers [x1,x2,x3,x4,x5] of which x1 stands for year, x2 for month, x3 for day, x4 for hour and x5 for minute.  (ex) at 3 o’clock on April 5th 2003: instant [2003,4,5,3,0]  An extended interval is a set of consecutive instants determined by a beginning instant and an ending instant.  (ex) on April 5th, 2003: interval","[[2003, 4,5,0,0], [2003,4,5,23,59]]  A duration refers to a temporal distance between two distinct instants.  (ex) for 5 years: duration [5,_,_,_,_] ","For the purpose of temporal description of a sentential event, we defined the following types and functional terms on the basis of typed lambda  2 See [Jo, 2000], [Lee, Ch., 1987], [Lee, H., 1993] and [Lee, J., 1982] for more detailed discussion. calculus3",".

The semantic and syntactic properties of","the phrase accompanying the temporal","markers play an important role to locate","the event in time.","2. It is necessary to distinguish mono-","occurrent sentences concerning a single","event from multi-occurrent sentences","concerning a set of different events10",". The","multi-occurrent nature is very often  8 [Renaud, 2002] defines the function used in this formula as follows: intref ” interval of reference [•̈I] ” [inferior•(•̈I), superior•(•̈I)] where the brackets denote an interval. max•E•M ” (E•M $N(MN E•N)) 9 We took the sentences from Yonsei malmunchi corpus built by Yonsei Center for Linguistic Information. 10 [Renaud, 2002]. signaled by bare plurals in nominal phrases, adverb like ch’arero ‘in turn’, and quantification modifiers.","3. When it comes to the multi-occurrent sentences, DONGAN adverbials impose constraints on the distribution of events in some cases (see (14)).","4. The quantification negates the distributional meaning brought by DONGAN adverbials and gets them to indicate the temporal scope of this semantic operation (see (14) and (15)).","5. As for the verbal infix ‘-at-’, its common semantic value is to denote the fact that the beginning of the event is anterior to the point of speech 11 ; le. beginning•e < pt_speech.","6. The information relevant to the time interpretation is scattered over the whole sentence; in the verbal phrase, quantification modifiers ranging over individuals or events, determiners in the nominal phrases and time adverbials. Therefore, the temporal interpretation of a sentence should be constructed in a compositional way.","7. For the same reason, the aspectual value should be attributed to the nuclear sentence and not to the verbal phrase. "]},{"title":"3 Computational implementation","paragraphs":["We discovered that Renaud’s G Grammar is suitable for the purpose of computational implementation of these facts. This grammar loads information on word definitions as little as possible and charges the rules with detailed description. This principle contributes to gathering the pieces of information scattered throughout a sentence and to establishing a semantic representation of the sentence in a compositional way. Moreover, it enables us to deal with all the other linguistic phenomena in the same way as with the temporal problems. This grammar has been applied to French [Renaud, 1996; 2000; 2002] and Japanese [Blin, 1997] as well.   11 [Reichenbach, 1966].","This grammar is divided into word definitions called ‘dico’ and composition rules.

Thus, the semantic term of type t5 is assigned to this time adverbial.","We also calculate the semantic term of the nuclear sentence relying on criteria such as quantification modification, mono/multi-occurrent and aspect 13",", which get involved in the feature constraint at the levels of both dico and of rules. Since the nuclear sentence of (11) is not modified by quantification, and since it concerns a single event of activity, it receives a semantic term of type c3 in the following figure.","  12 DONGAN accepts seven different syntactic structures: A.

As a result, we obtained seven distinct combinations as follows.
