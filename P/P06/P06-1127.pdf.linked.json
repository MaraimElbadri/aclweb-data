Five association measures including variants of Dice, Overlap Ratio, Jaccard, and Cosine, as well as Co-Occurrence Double Check (CODC), are presented. In the experiments on Rubenstein-Goodenough’s benchmark data set, the CODC measure achieves correlation coefficient 0.8492, which competes with the performance (0.8914) of the model using WordNet. The experiments on link detection of named entities using the strategies of direct association, association matrix and scalar association matrix verify that the double-check frequencies are reliable. Further study on named entity clustering shows that the five measures are quite useful. In particular, CODC measure is very stable on word-word and name-name experiments. The application of CODC measure to expand community chains for personal name disambiguation achieves 9.65% and 14.22% increase compared to the system without community expansion. All the experiments illustrate that the novel model of web search with double checking is feasible for mining associations from the web."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In statistical natural language processing, resources used to compute the statistics are indispensable. Different kinds of corpora have made available and many language models have been experimented. One major issue behind the corpus-based approaches is: if corpora adopted can reflect the up-to-date usage. As we know, languages are live. New terms and phrases are used in daily life. How to capture the new usages is an important research topic.","The Web is a heterogeneous document collec-tion. Huge-scale and dynamic nature are characteristics of the Web. Regarding the Web as a live corpus becomes an active research topic recently. How to utilize the huge volume of web data to measure association of information is an important issue. Resnik and Smith (2003) employ the Web as parallel corpora to provide bilingual sentences for translation models. Keller and Lapata (2003) show that bigram statistics for English language is correlated between corpus and web counts. Besides, how to get the word counts and the word association counts from the web pages without scanning over the whole collections is indispensable. Directly managing the web pages is not an easy task when the Web grows very fast.","Search engine provides some way to return useful information. Page counts for a query denote how many web pages containing a specific word or a word pair roughly. Page count is different from word frequency, which denotes how many occurrences a word appear. Lin and Chen (2004) explore the use of the page counts provided by different search engines to compute the statistics for Chinese segmentation. In addition to the page counts, snippets returned by web search, are another web data for training. A snippet consists of a title, a short summary of a web page and a hyperlink to the web page. Because of the cost to retrieve the full web pages, short summaries are always adopted (Lin, Chen, and Chen, 2005).","Various measures have been proposed to compute the association of objects of different granularity like terms and documents. Rodríguez and Egenhofer (2003) compute the semantic 1009 similarity from WordNet and SDTS ontology by word matching, feature matching and semantic neighborhood matching. Li et al. (2003) investigate how information sources could be used effectively, and propose a new similarity measure combining the shortest path length, depth and local density using WordNet. Matsuo et al. (2004) exploit the Jaccard coefficient to build “Web of Trust” on an academic community.","This paper measures the association of terms using snippets returned by web search. A web search with double checking model is proposed to get the statistics for various association measures in Section 2. Common words and personal names are used for the experiments in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Section 5 demonstrates how to derive communities from the Web using association measures, and employ them to disambiguate personal names. Finally, Section 6 concludes the remarks."]},{"title":"2 A Web Search with Double Checking Model","paragraphs":["Instead of simple web page counts and complex web page collection, we propose a novel model, a Web Search with Double Checking (WSDC), to analyze snippets. In WSDC model, two objects X and Y are postulated to have an association if we can find Y from X (a forward process) and find X from Y (a backward process) by web search. The forward process counts the total occurrences of Y in the top N snippets of query X, denoted as f(Y@X). Similarly, the backward process counts the total occurrences of X in the top N snippets of query Y, denoted as f(X@Y). The forward and the backward processes form a double check operation.","Under WSDC model, the association scores between X and Y are defined by various formulas as follows. ⎪⎪ ⎩ ⎪⎪ ⎨ ⎧ ++ == = Otherwise YfXf YXfXYf YXf orXYfif YXeVariantDic )()( )@()@( 0)@( 0)@( 0  ),( (1) )()( ))@(),@(( ,( YfXf YXfXYfmin Y)XineVariantCos ×= (2) ))@(),@(()()( ))@(),@((  YXfXYfmaxYfXf YXfXYfmin(X,Y)cardVariantJac −+ = (3)"]},{"title":"{}","paragraphs":[")}(),({ )@(),@( ),(","YfXfmin YXfXYfmin YXrlapVariantOve = (4) ⎪⎪ ⎩ ⎪⎪ ⎨ ⎧ == = ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛","× Otherwise YXf orXYfif YXCODC Yf YXf","Xf XYf log"]},{"title":"e","paragraphs":["α )( )@( )( )@( 0)@( 0)@( 0 ),(  (5) Where f(X) is the total occurrences of X in the top N snippets of query X, and, similarly, f(Y) is the total occurrences of Y in the top N snippets of query Y.

Formula (5) is a function CODC (Co-Occurrence Double-Check), which measures the association in an interval [0,1]. In the extreme cases, when f(Y@X)=0 or f(X@Y)=0, CODC(X,Y)=0; and when f(Y@X)=f(X) and f(X@Y)=f(Y), CODC(X,Y)=1. In the first case, X and Y are of no association.

We will demonstrate how to extend our WSDC method to mine the association of personal names. That will be difficult to resolve with previous approaches. We design two experiments – say, link detection test and named entity clustering, to evaluate the association of named entities.","Given a named-entity set L, we define a link detection test to check if any two named entities NEi and NEj (i≠j) in L have a relationship R using the following three strategies.","• Direct Association: If the double check frequency of NEi and NEj is larger than 0,  Figure 1. Three Strategies for Link Detection i.e., f(NEj@NEi)>0 and f(NEi@NEj)>0, then the link detection test says “yes”, i.e., NEi and NEj have direct association. Otherwise, the test says “no”. Figure 1(a) shows the direct association.","• Association Matrix: Compose an n×n binary matrix M=(mij), where mij=1 if f(NEj@NEi)>0 and f(NEi@NEj)>0; mij=0 if f(NEj@NEi)=0 or f(NEi@NEj)=0; and n is total number of named entities in L. Let Mt","be a transpose matrix of M. The matrix A=M×Mt","is an association matrix. Here the element aij in A means that total aij common named entities are associated with both NEi and NEj directly. Figure 1(b) shows a one-layer indirect association. Here, aij=3. We can define NEi and NEj have an indirect association if aij is larger than a threshold λ. That is, NEi and NEj should associate with at least λ common named entities directly. The strategy of association matrix specifies: if aij≥λ, then the link detection test says “yes”, otherwise it says “no”. In the example shown in Figure 1(b), NEi and NEj are indirectly associated when 0<λ≤3.","• Scalar Association Matrix: Compose a binary association matrix B from the association matrix A as: bij=1 if aij>0 and bij=0 if aij=0. The matrix S= B×Bt","is a scalar as-1012 sociation matrix. NEi and NEj may indirectly associate with a common named entity NEk. Figure 1(c) shows a two-layer indirect association.

In other words, if sij >δ, then the link detection test says “yes”, otherwise it says “no”.","To evaluate the performance of the above three strategies, we prepare a test set extracted from domz web site (http://dmoz.org), the most comprehensive human-edited directory of the Web. The test data consists of three communities: actor, tennis player, and golfer, shown in Table 3. Total 220 named entities are considered. The golden standard of link detection test is: we compose 24,090 (=220×219/2) named entity pairs, and assign “yes” to those pairs belonging to the same community. Category Path in domz.org","# of Person Names Top: Sports: Golf: Golfers 10 Top: Sports: Tennis: Players: Female (+Male) 90 Top: Arts: People: Image Galleries: Female (+Male): Individual 120 Table 3. Test Set for Association Evaluation of Named Entities","When collecting the related values for computing the double check frequencies for any named entity pair (NEi and NEj), i.e., f(NEj@NEi), f(NEi@NEj), f(NEi), and f(NEj), we consider naming styles of persons. For example, “Alba, Jessica” have four possible writing: “Alba, Jessica”, “Jessica Alba”, “J. Alba” and “Alba, J.” We will get top N snippets for each naming style, and filter out duplicate snippets as well as snippets of ULRs including dmoz.org and google.com. Table 4 lists the experimental results of link detection on the test set. The precisions of two baselines are: guessing all “yes” (46.45%) and guessing all “no” (53.55%). All the three strategies are better than the two baselines and the performance becomes better when the numbers of snippets increase. The strategy of direct association shows that using double checks to measure the association of named entities also gets good effects as the association of common words. For the strategy of association matrix, the best performance 90.14% occurs in the case of 900 snippets and λ=6. When larger number of snippets is used, a larger threshold is necessary to achieve a better performance. Figure 2(a) illustrates the relationship between precision and threshold (λ). The performance decreases when λ>6. The performance of the strategy of scalar association matrix is better than that of the strategy of association matrix in some λ and δ. Figure 2(b) shows the relationship between precision and threshold δ for some number of snippets and λ.","In link detection test, we only consider the binary operation of double checks, i.e., f(NEj@NEi) > 0 and f(NEi@NEj) > 0, rather than utilizing the magnitudes of f(NEj@NEi) and f(NEi@NEj). Next we employ the five formulas proposed in Section 2 to cluster named entities. The same data set as link detection test is adopted. An agglomerative average-link clustering algorithm is used to partition the given 220 named entities based on Formulas (1)-(5). Four-fold crossvalidation is employed and B-CUBED metric (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) is adopted to evaluate the clustering results. Table 5 summarizes the experimental results. CODC (Formula 5), which behaves the best in computing association of common words, still achieves the better performance on different numbers of snippets in named entity clustering. The F-scores of the other formulas are larger than 95% when more snippets are considered to compute the double check frequencies.

Disambiguation without/with Community Expansion 1015","Table 7 shows the performance of a personal name disambiguation system without (M1)/with (M2) community expansion. In the news data set (i.e., UDN), M1 is a little better than M2. Compared to M1, M2 decreases 0.98% of F-score. In contrast, in the two web data sets (i.e., TW and CN), M2 is much better than M1. M2 has 9.65% and 14.22% increases compared to M1. It shows that mining association of named entities from the Web is very useful to disambiguate ambiguous names. The application also confirms the effectiveness of the proposed association measures indirectly."]},{"title":"6 Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["This paper introduces five novel association measures based on web search with double checking (WSDC) model. In the experiments on association of common words, Co-Occurrence Double Check (CODC) measure competes with the model trained from WordNet. In the experiments on the association of named entities, which is hard to deal with using WordNet, WSDC model demonstrates its usefulness. The strategies of direct association, association matrix, and scalar association matrix detect the link between two named entities. The experiments verify that the double-check frequencies are reliable.","Further study on named entity clustering shows that the five measures – say, VariantDice, VariantOverlap, ariantJaccard, VariantCosine and CODC, are quite useful. In particular, CODC is very stable on word-word and name-name experiments. Finally, WSDC model is used to expand community chains for a specific personal name, and CODC measures the association of community member and the personal name. The application on personal name disambiguation shows that 9.65% and 14.22% increase compared to the system without community expansion."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["Research of this paper was partially supported by National Science Council, Taiwan, under the contracts 94-2752-E-001-001-PAE and 95-2752-E-001-001-PAE."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["A.
