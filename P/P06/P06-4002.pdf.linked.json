A trivial dialogue phrase is dened as an expression used by a chatbot program as the answer of a user input. A transfer-like genetic algorithm (GA) method is used to generating the trivial dialogue phrases for the creation of a natural language generation (NLG) knowledge base. The automatic evaluation of a generated phrase is performed by producing n-grams and retrieving their frequencies from the World Wide Web (WWW). Preliminary experiments show very positive results."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Natural language generation has devoted itself to studying and simulating the production of written or spoken discourse. From the canned text approach, in which the computer prints out a text given by a programmer, to the template lling approach, in which predetermined templates are lled up to produce a desired output, the applications and limitations of language generation have been widely studied. Well known applications of natural language generation can be found in human-computer conversation (HCC) systems. One of the most famous HCC systems, ELIZA (Weizenbaum, 1966), uses the template lling approach to generate the system’s response to a user input. For a dialogue system, the template lling approach works well in certain situations, however due to the templates limitations, nonsense is produced easily.","In recent research Inui et al. (2003) have used a corpus-based approach to language generation. Due to its exibility and applicability to open domain, such an approach might be considered as more robust than the template lling approach when applied to dialogue systems. In their approach, Inui et al. (2003), applied keyword matching in order to extract sample dialogues from a dialogue corpus, i.e., utterance-response pairs. After applying certain transfer or exchange rules, the sentence with maximum occurrence probability is given to the user as the system’s response. Other HCC systems, e.g. Wallace (2005), have applied the corpus based approach to natural language generation in order to retrieve system’s trivial dialogue responses. However, the creation of the hand crafted knowledge base, that is to say, a dialogue corpus, is a highly time consuming and hard to accomplish task1",". Therefore we aim to automatically generate and evaluate a database of trivial dialogue phrases that could be implemented as knowledge base language generator for open domain dialogue systems, or chatbots.","In this paper, we propose the automatic generation of trivial dialogue phrases through the application of a transfer-like genetic algorithm (GA) approach. We propose as well, the automatic evaluation of the correctness2","of the generated phrase using the WWW as a knowledge database. The generated database could serve as knowledge base to automatically improve publicly available chatbot3","databases, e.g. Wallace (2005). 1 The creation of the ALICE chatbot database (ALICE","brain) has cost more that 30 researchers, over 10 years","work to accomplish. http://www.alicebot.org/superbot.html","http://alicebot.org/articles/wallace/dont.html 2 Correctness implies here whether the expression is gram-","matically correct, and whether the expression exists in the","Web. 3 Computer program that simulates human conversation. 5"]},{"title":"2 Overview and Related Work","paragraphs":["Figure 1: System Overview","We apply a GA-like transfer approach to automatically generate new trivial dialogue phrases, where each phrase is considered as a gene, and the words of the phrase represent the DNA. The transfer approach to language generation has been used by Arendse (1998), where a sentence is being re-generated through word substitution. Problems of erroneous grammar or ambiguity are solved by referring to a lexicon and a grammar, re-generating substitutes expressions of the original sentence, and the user deciding which one of the generated expressions is correct. Our method differs in the application of a GA-like transfer process in order to automatically insert new features on the selected original phrase and the automatic evaluation of the newly generated phrase using the WWW. We assume the automatically generated trivial phrases database is desirable as a knowledge base for open domain dialogue systems. Our system general overview is shown in Figure 1. A description of each step is given hereunder."]},{"title":"3 Trivial Dialogue Phrases Generation: Transfer-like GA Approach 3.1 Initial Population Selection","paragraphs":["In the population selection process a small population of phrases are selected randomly from the Phrase DB4",". This is a small database created be-forehand. The Phrase DB was used for setting the thresholds for the evaluation of the generated phrases. It contains phrases extracted from real human-human trivial dialogues (obtained from the corpus of the University of South California (2005)) and from the hand crafted ALICE 4 In this paper DB stands for database. database. For the experiments this DB contained 15 trivial dialogue phrases. Some of those trivial dialogue phrases are: do you like airplanes ?, have you have your lunch ?, I am glad you are impressed, what are your plans for the weekend ?, and so forth. The initial population is formed by a number of phrases randomly selected between one and the total number of expressions in the database. No evaluation is performed to this initial population. 3.2 Crossover Since the length, i.e., number of words, among the analyzed phrases differs and our algorithm does not use semantical information, in order to avoid the distortion of the original phrase, in our system the crossover rate was selected to be 0%. This is in order to ensure a language independent method. The generation of the new phrase is given solely by the mutation process explained below. 3.3 Mutation During the mutation process, each one of the phrases of the selected initial population is mutated at a rate of",", where N is the total number of words in the phrase. The mutation is performed through a transfer process, using the Features DB. This DB contains descriptive features of different topics of human-human dialogues. The word features refers here to the specic part of speech used, that is, nouns, adjectives and adverbs5",". In order to extract the descriptive features that the Feature DB contains, different human-human dialogues, (USC, 2005), were clustered by topic6","and the most descriptive nouns, adjectives and adverbs of each topic were extracted. The word to be replaced within the original phrase is randomly selected as well as it is randomly selected the substitution feature to be used as a replacement from the Feature DB. In order to obtain a language independent system, at this stage part of speech tagging was not performed7",". For this mutation process, the total number of possible different expressions that could be generated from a given phrase is",", where the exponent","is the total number of features in the Feature DB. 5 For the preliminary experiment this database contained","30 different features 6 Using agglomerative clustering with the publicly avail-","able Cluto toolkit 7 POS tagging was used when creating the Features DB.","Alternatively, instead of using POS, the features might be","given by hand 6 Total no Phrases Gen Unnatural Usable Completely Natural Precision Recall","Accepted Rejected Accepted Rejected Accepted Rejected Accepted Rejected 80 511 36 501 18 8 26 2 0.550 0.815","Total 591 Total 537 Total 26 Total 28","Table 3. Human Evaluation - Naturalness of the Phrases 3.4 Evaluation In order to evaluate the correctness of the newly generated expression, we used as database the WWW. Due to its signicant growth8",", the WWW has become an attractive database for different systems applications as, machine translation (Resnik and Smith, 2003), question answering (Kwok et al., 2001), commonsense retrieval (Matuszek et al., 2005), and so forth. In our approach we attempt to evaluate whether a generated phrase is correct through its frequency of appearance in the Web, i.e., the tness as a function of the frequency of appearance. Since matching an entire phrase on the Web might result in very low retrieval, in some cases even non retrieval at all, we applied the sectioning of the given phrase into its respective n-grams. 3.4.1 N-Grams Production","For each one of the generated phrases to evaluate, n-grams are produced. The n-grams used are bigram, trigram, and quadrigram. Their frequency of appearance on the Web (using Google search engine) is searched and ranked.

Results for 150 Generations","As part of the preliminary experiment, the generated phrases were evaluated by a native English speaker in order to determine their naturalness. The human evaluation of the generated phrases was performed under the criterion of the following categories: a) Unnatural: a phrase that would not be used during a conversation. b) Usable: a phrase that could be used during a conversation,even though it is not a common phrase. c) Completely Natural: a phrase that might be commonly used during a conversation.","The results of the human evaluation are shown in Table 3. In this evaluation, 26 out of the 80 phrases accepted by the system were considered completely natural, and 18 out of the 80 accepted were considered usable, for a total of 44 well-generated phrases12",". On the other hand, the system mis-evaluation is observed mostly within the accepted phrases, i.e., 36 out of 80 accepted were unnatural, whereas within the rejected phrases only 8 out of 511 were considered usable and 2 out of 511 were considered completely natural, which affected negatively the pre-","11","Processing time: 20 hours 13 minutes.

According with the criterion shown above, the generated phrases were evaluated by a user to determine their naturalness - applicability to dialogue. 4.1 Discussion Recall is the rate of the well-generated phrases given as accepted by the system divided by the total number of well-generated phrases. This is a measure of the coverage of the system in terms of the well-generated phrases. On the other hand, the precision rates the well-generated phrases divided by the total number of accepted phrases. The precision is a measure of the correctness of the system in terms of the evaluation of the phrases. For this experiment the recall of the system was 0.815, i.e., 81.5% of the total number of well-generated phrases where correctly selected, however this implied a trade-off with the precision, which was compromised by the system’s wide coverage.","An inuential factor in the system precision and recall is the selection of new features to be used during the mutation process. This is because the insertion of a new feature gives rise to a totally new phrase that might not be related to the original one. In the same tradition, a decisive factor in the evaluation of a well-generated phrase is the constantly changing information available on the Web. This fact rises thoughts of the application of variable threshold for evaluation. Even though the system leaves room for improvement, its successful implementation has been conrmed."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions and Future Directions","paragraphs":["We presented an automatic trivial dialogue phrases generator system.
