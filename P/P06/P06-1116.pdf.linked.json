In scientic discourse, such meta-discourse (Myers, 1992; Hyland, 1998) abounds and plays an important role in marking the discourse structure of the texts.","Finding these variants can be useful for many text understanding tasks because semi-xed cue phrases act as linguistic markers indicating the importance and/or the rhetorical role of some adjacent text. For the summarisation of scientic","1","In contrast to standard work in discourse linguistics, which mostly considers sentence connectives and adverbials as cue phrases, our denition includes longer phrases, some-times even entire sentences. papers, cue phrases such as Our paper deals with. . . are commonly used as indicators of extraction-worthiness of sentences (Kupiec et al., 1995). Re-generative (rather than extractive) summarisation methods may want to go further than that and directly use the knowledge that a certain sentence contains the particular research aim of a paper, or a claimed gap in the literature. Similarly, in the task of automatic routing of customer emails and automatic answering of some of these, the detection of threats of legal action could be useful.","However, systems that use cue phrases usually rely on manually compiled lists, the acquisition of which is time-consuming and error-prone and results in cue phrases which are genre-specic. Methods for nding cue phrases automatically include Hovy and Lin (1998) (using the ratio of word frequency counts in summaries and their corresponding texts), Teufel (1998) (using the most frequent n-grams), and Paice (1981) (using a pattern matching grammar and a lexicon of manually collected equivalence classes). The main is-sue with string-based pattern matching techniques is that they cannot capture syntactic generalisations such as active/passive constructions, different tenses and modication by adverbial, adjectival or prepositional phrases, appositions and other parenthetical material.","For instance, we may be looking for sentences expressing the goal or main contribution of a paper; Fig. 1 shows candidates of such sentences.

Figure 1: Goal statements and syntactic variation correct matches (a-e) and incorrect matches (f-i) 921 Cases f)i) in contrast are false matches: they do not express the authors’ goals, although they are supercially similar to the correct contexts. While string-based approaches (Paice, 1981; Teufel, 1998) are too restrictive to cover the wide variation within the correct contexts, bag-of-words approaches such as Agichtein and Gravano’s (2000) are too permissive and would miss many of the distinctions between correct and incorrect contexts.","Lisacek et al. (2005) address the task of identifying paradigm shift sentences in the biomedical literature, i.e. statements of thwarted expectation. This task is somewhat similar to ours in its denition by rhetorical context. Their method goes beyond string-based matching: In order for a sentence to qualify, the right set of concepts must be present in a sentence, with any syntactic relationship holding between them. Each concept set is encoded as a xed, manually compiled lists of strings. Their method covers only one particular context (the paradigm shift one), whereas we are looking for a method where many types of cue phrases can be acquired. Whereas it relies on manually assembled lists, we advocate data-driven acquisition of new contexts. This is generally preferrable to manual denition, as language use is changing, inventive and hard to predict and as many of the relevant concepts in a domain may be infrequent (cf. the formulation be cursed, which was used in our corpus as a way of describing a method’s problems). It also allows the acquisition of cue phrases in new domains, where the exact prevalent meta-discourse might not be known.","Riloff’s (1993) method for learning information extraction (IE) patterns uses a syntactic parse and correspondences between the text and lled MUCstyle templates to learn context in terms of lexico-semantic patterns. However, it too requires substantial hand-crafted knowledge: 1500 lled templates as training material, and a lexicon of semantic features for roughly 3000 nouns for constraint checking. Unsupervised methods for similar tasks include Agichtein and Gravano’s (2000) work, which shows that clusters of vector-space-based patterns can be successfully employed to detect specic IE relationships (companies and their headquarters), and Ravichandran and Hovy’s (2002) algorithm for nding patterns for a Question Answering (QA) task. Based on training material in the shape of pairs of question and answer terms e.g., (e.g. {Mozart, 1756}), they learn the a) In this paper, we introduce a method for similarity-based estimation of . . . b) Here, we present a similarity-based approach for estimation of. . . c) In this paper, we propose an algorithm which is . . . d) We will here dene a technique for similarity-based. . . Figure 2: Context around cue phrases (lexical variants) semantics holding between these terms (birth year) via frequent string patterns occurring in the context, such as A was born in B, by considering n-grams of all repeated substrings. What is common to these three works is that bootstrapping relies on constraints between the context external to the extracted material and the extracted material itself, and that the target extraction material is dened by real-world relations.","Our task differs in that the cue phrases we extract are based on general rhetorical relations holding in all scientic discourse. Our approach for nding semantically similar variants in an unsupervised fashion relies on bootstrapping of seeds from within the cue phrase. The assumption is that every semi-xed cue phrase contains at least two main concepts whose syntax and semantics mutually constrain each other (e.g. verb and direct object in phrases such as (we) present an approach for). The expanded cue phrases are recognised in various syntactic contexts using a parser2",". General semantic constraints valid for groups of semantically similar cue phrases are then applied to model, e.g., the fact that it must be the authors who present the method, not somebody else.","We demonstrate that such an approach is more appropriate for our task than IE/QA bootstrapping mechanisms based on cue phrase-external context. Part of the reason for why normal bootstrapping does not work for our phrases is the difculty of nding negatives contexts, essential in bootstrapping to evaluate the quality of the patterns automatically. IE and QA approaches, due to uniqueness assumptions of the real-world relations that these methods search for, have an automatic denition of negative contexts by hard constraints (i.e., all contexts involving Mozart and any other year are by denition of the wrong semantics; so are all contexts involving Microsoft and a city other than Redmond). As our task is not grounded in real-world relations but in rhetorical ones, constraints found in the context tend to be","2","Thus, our task shows some parallels to work in paraphrasing (Barzilay and Lee, 2002) and syntactic variant generation (Jacquemin et al., 1997), but the methods are very different. 922 soft rather than hard (cf. Fig 2): while it it possible that strings such as we and in this paper occur more often in the context of a given cue phrase, they also occur in many other places in the paper where the cue phrase is not present. Thus, it is hard to dene clear negative contexts for our task.","The novelty of our work is thus the new pattern extraction task (nding variants of semi-xed cue phrases), a task for which it is hard to directly use the context the patterns appear in, and an iterative unsupervised bootstrapping algorithm for lexical variants, using phrase-internal seeds and ranking similar candidates based on relation strength between the seeds.","While our method is applicable to general cue phrases, we demonstrate it here with transitive verbdirect object pairs, namely a) cue phrases in-troducing a new methodology (and thus the main research goal of the scientic article; e.g. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm. . . ) we call those goal-type cue phrases; and b) cue phrases indicating continuation of previous other research (e.g. Therefore, we adopt the approach presented in [1]. . . ) continuation-type cue phrases."]},{"title":"2 Lexical Bootstrapping Algorithm","paragraphs":["The task of this module is to nd lexical variants of the components of the seed cue phrases. Given the seed phrases we introduce a method and we propose a model, the algorithm starts by nding all direct objects of introduce in a given corpus and, using an appropriate similarity measure, ranks them according to their distributional similarity to the nouns method and model. Subsequently, the noun method is used to nd transitive verbs and rank them according to their similarity to introduce and propose. In both cases, the ranking step retains variants that preserve the semantics of the cue phrase (e.g. develop and approach) and lters irrelevant terms that change the phrase semantics (e.g. need and example).","Stopping at this point would limit us to those terms that co-occur with the seed words in the training corpus.

Figure 3: Lexical variant bootstrapping algorithm estimate frequencies for the Rank step from the written portion of the British National Corpus (BNC, Burnard (1995)), 90 Million words. For the Hypothesize step, we experiment with two data sets: First, the scientic subsection of the BNC (24 Million words), which we parse using RASP (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002); we then examine the grammatical relations (GRs) for transitive verb constructions, both in active and passive voice. This method guarantees that we nd al-most all transitive verb constructions cleanly; Carroll et al. (1999) report an accuracy of .85 for 923 DOs, Active: \"AGENT STRING AUX active-verb-element DETERMINER * POSTMOD\" DOs, Passive: \"DETERMINER * AUX active-verb-element element\" TVs, Active: \"AGENT STRING AUX * DETERMINER active-noun- element POSTMOD\" TVs, Passive:\"DET active-noun-element AUX * POSTMOD\" Figure 4: Query patterns for retrieving direct objects (DOs) and transitive verbs (TVs) in the Hypothesize step. newspaper articles for this relation. Second, in order to obtain larger coverage and more current data we also experiment with Google Scholar3",", an automatic web-based indexer of scientic literature (mainly peer-reviewed papers, technical reports, books, pre-prints and abstracts). Google Scholar snippets are often incomplete fragments which cannot be parsed. For practical reasons, we decided against processing the entire documents, and obtain an approximation to direct objects and transitive verbs with regular expressions over the result snippets in both active and passive voice (cf. Fig. 4), designed to be high-precision4",". The amount of data available from BNC and Google Scholar is not directly comparable: harvesting Google Scholar snippets for both active and passive constructions gives around 2000 sentences per seed (Google Scholar returns up to 1000 results per query), while the number of BNC sentences containing seed words in active and passive form varies from 11 (formalism) to 5467 (develop) with an average of 1361 sentences for the experimental seed pairs. Ranking Having obtained our candidate sets (either from the scientic subsection of the BNC or from Google Scholar), the members are ranked using BNC frequencies. We investigate two ranking methodologies: frequency-based and context-based. Frequency-based ranking simply ranks each member of the candidate set by how many times it is retrieved together with the current active element. Context-based ranking uses a similarity measure for computing the scores, giving a higher score to those words that share sufciently similar contexts with the members of the reference set. We consider similarity measures in a vector space dened either by a xed window, by the sentence window, or by syntactic relationships. The score assigned to each word in the candidate set is the sum of its semantic similarity values computed with respect to each member in the reference set.","3","http://scholar.google.com","4","The capitalised words in these patterns are replaced by actual words (e.g. AGENT STRING: We/I, DETERMINER: a/ an/our), and the extracted words (indicated by *)are lemmatised. Syntactic contexts, as opposed to window-based contexts, constrain the context of a word to only those words that are grammatically related to it. We use verb-object relations in both active and passive voice constructions as did Pereira et al. (1993) and Lee (1999), among others. We use the cosine similarity measure for window-based contexts and the following commonly used similarity measures for the syntactic vector space: Hindle’s (1990) measure, the weighted Lin measure (Wu and Zhou, 2003), the α-Skew divergence measure (Lee, 1999), the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence measure (Lin, 1991), Jaccard’s coefcient (van Rijsbergen, 1979) and the Confusion probability (Essen and Steinbiss, 1992). The Jensen-Shannon measure JS (x1, x2) = ∑ y∈Y ∑ x∈{x1,x2} ( P (y|x) log ( P(y|x) 1 2 (P(y|x1)+P(y|x2)) )) subsequently performed best for our task. We compare the different ranking methodologies and data sets with respect to a manually-dened gold standard list of 20 goal-type verbs and 20 nouns. This list was manually assembled from Teufel (1999); WordNet synonyms and other plausible verbs and nouns found via Web searches on scientic articles were added. We ensured by searches on the ACL anthology that there is good evidence that the gold-standard words indeed occur in the right contexts, i.e. in goal statement sentences. As we want to nd similarity metrics and data sources which result in accumulator lists with many of these gold members at high ranks, we need a measure that rewards exactly those lists. We use non-interpolated Mean Average Precision (MAP), a standard measure for evaluating ranked information retrieval runs, which combines precision and recall and ranges from 0 to 15",".","We use 8 pairs of 2-tuples as input (e.g. [introduce, study] & [approach, method]), randomly selected from the gold standard list.

Fig. 5 summarises the MAP scores for the rst iteration, where Google Scholar signicantly outperformed the BNC. The best result for this iteration (MAP=.550) was achieved by combining Google Scholar and the Jensen-Shannon measure. The algorithm stops to iterate when no more improvement can be obtained, in this case after 4 iterations, resulting in a nal MAP of .619.","Although α-Skew outperforms the simpler measures in ranking nouns, its performance on verbs is worse than the performance of Weighted Lin. While Lee (1999) argues that α-Skew’s asymmetry can be advantageous for nouns, this probably does not hold for verbs: verb hierarchies have much shallower structure than noun hierarchies with most verbs concentrated on one level (Miller et al., 1990). This would explain why JS, which is symmetric compared to the α-Skew metric, performed better in our experiments.","In the evaluation presented here we therefore use Google Scholar data and the JS measure. An additional improvement (MAP=.630) is achieved when we incorporate a lter based on the following hypothesis: goal-type verbs should be more likely to have their direct objects preceded by in-denite articles rather than denite articles or possessive determiners (because a new method is introduced) whereas continuation-type verbs should prefer denite articles with their direct objects (as an existing method is involved)."]},{"title":"3 Syntactic variants and semantic lters","paragraphs":["The syntactic variant extractor takes as its input the raw text and the lists of verbs and nouns generated by the lexical bootstrapper.

These constraints encode semantic principles that will apply to all cue phrases of that rhetorical category. Examples for constraints are: if work is referred to as being done in previous own work, it is probably not a goal statement; the work in a goal statement must be presented here or in the current paper (the concept of ‘here-ness); and the agents of a goal statement have to be the authors, not other people. While these lters are manually dened, they are modular, encode general principles, and can be combined to express a wide range of rhetorical contexts. We veried that around 20 semantic constraints are enough to cover a large sets of different cue phrases (the 1700 cue phrases from Teufel (1999)), though not all of these are implemented yet.","A nice side-effect of our approach is the simple characterisation of a cue phrase (by a syntactic relationship, some seed words for each concept, and some general, reusable semantic constraints).

For the gold standard-evaluation, we ran our system on a test set of 121 scientic articles drawn from the CmpLg corpus (Teufel, 1999) entirely different texts from the ones the system was trained on. Documents were manually annotated by the second author for (possibly more than one) goal-type sentence; annotation of that type has been previously shown to be reliable at K=.71 (Teufel, 1999). Our evaluation recorded how often the system’s highest-ranked candidate was indeed a goal-type sentence; as this is a precision-critical task, we do not measure recall here.","We compared our system against our reimplementation of Ravichandran and Hovy’s (2002) paraphrase learning.

By considering all possible substrings, an extensive list of candidate patterns was assembled. Patterns with single occurrences were discarded, leaving a list of 5580 patterns (examples in Fig. 8).

The system achieved 80% precision of goal-type phrases of the targeted syntactic shape (88% if only the bootstrapping module is evaluated), and good quality ratings from human judges. We found Google Scholar to perform better than BNC as source for nding hypotheses for lexical variants, which may be due to the larger amount of data available to Google Scholar.

Examples for such other types of phrases are given in Fig. 12; the second cue phrase involves a complex syntactic relationship between the two seeds (or possibly it could be considered as a cue phrase with three seeds). We will next investigate if the positive results presented here can be maintained for other syntactic contexts and for cue phrases with more than two seeds.","The syntactic variant extractor could be enhanced in various ways, eg. by resolving anaphora in cue phrases. A more sophisticated model of syntactically weighted vector space (Pado and Lapata, 2003) may help improve the lexical acquisition phase. Another line for future work is bootstrapping meaning across cue phrases within the same rhetorical class, e.g. to learn that we propose a method for X and we aim to do X are equivalent. As some papers will contain both variants of the cue phrase, with very similar material (X) in the vicinity, they could be used as starting point for experiments to validate cue phrase equivalence."]},{"title":"7 Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work was funded by the EPSRC projects CIT-RAZ (GR/S27832/01, Rhetorical Citation Maps and Domain-independent Argumentative Zon-ing) and SCIBORG (EP/C010035/1, Extracting the Science from Scientic Publications)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Eugene Agichtein and Luis Gravano. 2000.
