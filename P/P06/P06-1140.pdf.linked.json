In particular, in the limited domain of a spoken language dialogue system, it is possible to achieve highly natural synthesis with a purpose-built voice (Black and Lenzo, 2000). However, it can be difficult to develop 1 See e.g. (Hunt and Black, 1996; Black and Taylor, 1997;","Beutnagel et al., 1999). a synthetic voice for a dialogue system that produces natural speech completely reliably, and thus in practice output quality can be quite variable. Two important factors in this regard are the label-ing process for the speech database and the direc-tion of the dialogue system’s further development, after the voice has been built: when labels are assigned fully automatically to the recorded speech, label boundaries may be inaccurate, leading to unnatural sounding joins in speech output; and when further system development leads to the generation of utterances that are less like those in the recording script, such utterances must be synthesized using smaller units with more joins between them, which can lead to a considerable dropoff in quality.","As suggested by Bulyko and Ostendorf (2002), one avenue for improving synthesis quality in a dialogue system is to have the system choose what to say in part by taking into account what is likely to sound natural when synthesized. The idea is to take advantage of the generator’s periphrastic ability:2","given a set of generated paraphrases that suitably express the desired content in the dialogue context, the system can select the specific paraphrase to use as its response according to the predicted quality of the speech synthesized for that paraphrase. In this way, if there are significant differences in the predicted synthesis quality for the various paraphrases—and if these predictions are generally borne out—then, by selecting paraphrases with high predicted synthesis quality, the dialogue system (as a whole) can more reliably produce natural sounding speech.","In this paper, we present an application of dis-2","See e.g. (Iordanskaja et al., 1991; Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Pang et al., 2003) for discussion of paraphrase in generation. 1113 criminative reranking to the task of adapting a language generator to the strengths and weaknesses of a particular synthetic voice. Our method in-volves training a reranker to select paraphrases that are predicted to sound natural when synthesized, from the N-best realizations produced by the generator. The ranker is trained in supervised fashion, using human judgements of synthetic voice quality on a representative sample of the paraphrases. In principle, the method can be employed with any speech synthesizer. Additionally, when features derived from the synthesizer’s unit selection search can be made available, further quality improvements become possible.","The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review previous work on integrating choice in language generation and speech synthesis, and on learning discriminative rerankers for generation. In Section 3, we present our method. In Section 4, we describe a cross-validation study whose results indicate that discriminative paraphrase reranking can achieve substantial improvements in naturalness on average. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude with a summary and a discussion of future work."]},{"title":"2 Previous Work","paragraphs":["Most previous work on integrating language generation and synthesis, e.g. (Davis and Hirschberg, 1988; Prevost and Steedman, 1994; Hitzeman et al., 1998; Pan et al., 2002), has focused on how to use the information present in the language generation component in order to specify contextually appropriate intonation for the speech synthesizer to target. For example, syntactic structure, information structure and dialogue context have all been argued to play a role in improving prosody prediction, compared to unrestricted text-to-speech synthesis. While this topic remains an important area of research, our focus is instead on a different opportunity that arises in a dialogue system, namely, the possibility of choosing the exact wording and prosody of a response according to how natural it is likely to sound when synthesized.","To our knowledge, Bulyko and Ostendorf (2002) were the first to propose allowing the choice of wording and prosody to be jointly determined by the language generator and speech synthesizer. In their approach, a template-based generator passes a prosodically annotated word net-work to the speech synthesizer, rather than a single text string (or prosodically annotated text string). To perform the unit selection search on this expanded input efficiently, they employ weighted finite-state transducers, where each step of net-work expansion is then followed by minimiza-tion. The weights are determined by concatenation (join) costs, relative frequencies (negative log probabilities) of the word sequences, and prosodic prediction costs, for cases where the prosody is not determined by the templates. In a perception experiment, they demonstrated that by expand-ing the space of candidate responses, their system achieved higher quality speech output.","Following (Bulyko and Ostendorf, 2002), Stone et al. (2004) developed a method for jointly determining wording, speech and gesture. In their approach, a template-based generator produces a word lattice with intonational phrase breaks. A unit selection algorithm then searches for a low-cost way of realizing a path through this lattice that combines captured motion samples with recorded speech samples to create coherent phrases, blending segments of speech and motion together phrase-by-phrase into extended utterances. Video demonstrations indicate that natural and highly expressive results can be achieved, though no human evaluations are reported.","In an alternative approach, Pan and Weng (2002) proposed integrating instance-based realization and synthesis. In their framework, sentence structure, wording, prosody and speech waveforms from a domain-specific corpus are simultaneously reused. To do so, they add prosodic and acoustic costs to the insertion, deletion and replacement costs used for instance-based surface realization. Their contribution focuses on how to design an appropriate speech corpus to facilitate an integrated approach to instance-based realization and synthesis, and does not report evaluation results.","A drawback of these approaches to integrating choice in language generation and synthesis is that they cannot be used with most existing speech synthesizers, which do not accept (annotated) word lattices as input. In contrast, the approach we in-troduce here can be employed with any speech synthesizer in principle. All that is required is that the language generator be capable of produc-ing N-best outputs; that is, the generator must be able to construct a set of suitable paraphrases ex-1114 pressing the desired content, from which the top N realizations can be selected for reranking according to their predicted synthesis quality. Once the realizations have been reranked, the top scoring realization can be sent to the synthesizer as usual. Alternatively, when features derived from the synthesizer’s unit selection search can be made available—and if the time demands of the dialogue system permit—several of the top scoring reranked realizations can be sent to the synthesizer, and the resulting utterances can be rescored with the extended feature set.","Our reranking approach has been inspired by previous work on reranking in parsing and generation, especially (Collins, 2000) and (Walker et al., 2002). As in Walker et al.’s (2002) method for training a sentence plan ranker, we use our generator to produce a representative sample of paraphrases and then solicit human judgements of their naturalness to use as data for training the ranker. This method is attractive when there is no suitable corpus of naturally occurring dialogues available for training purposes, as is often the case for systems that engage in human-computer dialogues that differ substantially from human-human ones. The primary difference between Walker et al.’s work and ours is that theirs examines the impact on text quality of sentence planning decisions such as aggregation, whereas ours focuses on the impact of the lexical and syntactic choice at the surface realization level on speech synthesis quality, according to the strengths and weaknesses of a particular synthetic voice."]},{"title":"3 Reranking Realizations by Predicted Synthesis Quality 3.1 Generating Alternatives","paragraphs":["Our experiments with integrating language generation and synthesis have been carried out in the context of the COMIC3","multimodal dialogue system (den Os and Boves, 2003). The COMIC system adds a dialogue interface to a CAD-like application used in sales situations to help clients re-design their bathrooms. The input to the system includes speech, handwriting, and pen gestures; the output combines synthesized speech, an animated talking head, deictic gestures at on-screen objects, and direct control of the underlying application.","3","COnversational Multimodal Interaction with Computers, http://www.hcrc.ed.ac.uk/comic/.","Drawing on the materials used in (Foster and White, 2005) to evaluate adaptive generation in COMIC, we selected a sample of 104 sentences from 38 different output turns across three dialogues. For each sentence in the set, a variant was included that expressed the same content adapted to a different user model or adapted to a different dialogue history. For example, a description of a certain design’s colour scheme for one user might be phrased as As you can see, the tiles have a blue and green colour scheme, whereas a variant expression of the same content for a different user could be Although the tiles have a blue colour scheme, the design does also feature green, if the user disprefers blue.","In COMIC, the sentence planner uses XSLT to generate disjunctive logical forms (LFs), which specify a range of possible paraphrases in a nested free-choice form (Foster and White, 2004). Such disjunctive LFs can be efficiently realized using the OpenCCG realizer (White, 2004; White, 2006b; White, 2006a). Note that for the experiments reported here, we manually augmented the disjunctive LFs for the 104 sentences in our sample to make greater use of the periphrastic capabilities of the COMIC grammar; it remains for future work to augment the COMIC sentence planner produce these more richly disjunctive LFs automatically.","OpenCCG includes an extensible API for integrating language modeling and realization. To select preferred word orders, from among all those allowed by the grammar for the input LF, we used a backoff trigram model trained on approximately 750 example target sentences, where certain words were replaced with their semantic classes (e.g. MANUFACTURER, COLOUR) for better general-ization. For each of the 104 sentences in our sample, we performed 25-best realization from the disjunctive LF, and then randomly selected up to 12 different realizations to include in our experiments based on a simulated coin flip for each realization, starting with the top-scoring one. We used this procedure to sample from a larger portion of the N-best realizations, while keeping the sample size manageable.","Figure 1 shows an example of 12 paraphrases for a sentence chosen for inclusion in our sample.

First, a domain-specific recording script was prepared by selecting about 150 sentences from the larger set of target sentences used to train the system’s n-gram model. The sentences were greedily selected with the goals of ensuring that (i) all words (including proper names) in the target sentences appeared at least once in the record script, and (ii) all bigrams at the level of semantic classes (e.g. MANUFAC-TURER, COLOUR) were covered as well. For the cross-validation study reported in the next section, we also built a trigram model on the words in the domain-specific recording script, without replac-ing any words with semantic classes, so that we could examine whether the more frequent occurrence of the specific words and phrases in this part of the script is predictive of synthesis quality.","The domain-specific script was augmented with a set of 600 newspaper sentences selected for diphone coverage. The newspaper sentences make it possible for the voice to synthesize words outside of the domain-specific script, though not necessarily with the same quality. Once these scripts were in place, an amateur voice talent was recorded reading the sentences in the scripts dur-ing two recording sessions. Finally, after the speech files were semi-automatically segmented into individual sentences, the speech database was constructed, using fully automatic labeling.","We have found that the utterances synthesized with the COMIC voice vary considerably in their naturalness, due to two main factors. First, the system underwent further development after the voice was built, leading to the addition of a variety of new phrases to the system’s repertoire, as well as many extra proper names (and their pronunciations); since these names and phrases usually require going outside of the domain-specific part of the speech database, they often (though not always) exhibit a considerable dropoff in synthesis quality.6","And second, the boundaries of the automatically assigned unit labels were not always accurate, leading to problems with unnatural joins and reduced intelligibility. To improve the reliabil-ity of the COMIC voice, we could have recorded more speech, or manually corrected label bound-","6","Note that in the current version of the system, proper names are always required parts of the output, and thus the discriminative reranker cannot learn to simply choose paraphrases that leave out problematic names. 1116 aries; the goal of this paper is to examine whether the naturalness of a dialogue system’s output can be improved in a less labor-intensive way. 3.3 Rating Synthesis Quality To obtain data for training our realization reranker, we solicited judgements of the naturalness of the synthesized speech produced by Festival for the utterances in our sample COMIC corpus. Two judges (the first two authors) provided judgements on a 1–7 point scale, with higher scores represent-ing more natural synthesis. Ratings were gathered using WebExp2,7","with the periphrastic alternatives for each sentence presented as a group in a randomized order. Note that for practical reasons, the utterances were presented out of the dialogue context, though both judges were familiar with the kinds of dialogues that the COMIC system is capable of.","Though the numbers on the seven point scale were not assigned labels, they were roughly taken to be “horrible,” “poor,” “fair,” “ok,” “good,” “very good” and “perfect.” The average assigned rating across all utterances was 4.05 (“ok”), with a standard deviation of 1.56. The correlation between the two judges’ ratings was 0.45, with one judge’s ratings consistently higher than the other’s.","Some common problems noted by the judges included slurred words, especially the sometimes sounding like ther or even their; clipped words, such as has shortened at times to the point of sounding like is, or though clipped to unintelligibility; unnatural phrasing or emphasis, e.g. occasional pauses before a possessive ’s, or words such as style sounding emphasized when they should be deaccented; unnatural rate changes; “choppy” speech from poor joins; and some unintelligible proper names. 3.4 Ranking While Collins (2000) and Walker et al. (2002) develop their rankers using the RankBoost algorithm (Freund et al., 1998), we have instead chosen to use Joachims’ (2002) method of formulating ranking tasks as Support Vector Machine (SVM) constraint optimization problems.8","This choice has been motivated primarily by convenience, as Joachims’ SVM","package is easy to 7 http://www.hcrc.ed.ac.uk/web exp/ 8 See (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) for another application","of SVM ranking in generation, namely to the task of ranking","alternative text orderings for local coherence. use; we leave it for future work to compare the performance of RankBoost and SVM","on our ranking task.","The ranker takes as input a set of paraphrases that express the desired content of each sentence, optionally together with synthesized utterances for each paraphrase. The output is a ranking of the paraphrases according to the predicted naturalness of their corresponding synthesized utterances. Ranking is more appropriate than classification for our purposes, as naturalnesss is a graded assessment rather than a categorical one.","To encode the ranking task as an SVM constraint optimization problem, each paraphrase of a sentence is represented by a feature vector , where is the number of features. In the training data, the feature vectors are paired with the average value of their corresponding human judgements of naturalness. From this data, ordered pairs of paraphrases are derived, where has a higher naturalness rating than . The constraint optimization problem is then to derive a parameter vector that yields a ranking score function which minimizes the number of pairwise ranking violations. Ideally, for every ordered pair , we would have ; in practice, it is often impossible or intractable to find such a parameter vector, and thus slack variables are introduced that allow for training errors. A parameter to the algorithm controls the trade-off between ranking margin and training error.","In testing, the ranker’s accuracy can be determined by comparing the ranking scores for every ordered pair in the test data, and determining whether the actual preferences are borne out by the predicted preference, i.e. whether as desired. Note that the ranking scores, unlike the original ratings, do not have any meaning in the absolute sense; their import is only to order alternative paraphrases by their predicted naturalness.","In our ranking experiments, we have used SVM","with all parameters set to their default values. 3.5 Features Table 1 shows the feature sets we have investigated for reranking, distinguished by the availability of the features and the need for discriminative training. The first row shows the feature sets that are 1117","Table 1: Feature sets for reranking.","Discriminative Availability no yes","Realizer NGRAMS WORDS Synthesizer COSTS ALL available to the realizer. There are two n-gram models that can be used to directly rank alternative realizations: NGRAM-1, the language model used in COMIC, and NGRAM-2, the language model derived from the domain-specific recording script; for feature values, the negative logarithms are used. There are also two WORDS feature sets (shown in the second column): WORDS-BI, which includes NGRAMS plus a feature for every possible unigram and bigram, where the value of the feature is the count of the unigram or bigram in a given realization; and WORDS-TRI, which includes all the features in WORDS-BI, plus a feature for every possible trigram. The second row shows the feature sets that require information from the synthesizer. The COSTS feature set includes NGRAMS plus the total join and target costs from the unit selection search. Note that a weighted sum of these costs could be used to directly rerank realizations, in much the same way as relative frequencies and concatenation costs are used in (Bulyko and Ostendorf, 2002); in our experiments, we let SVM","determine how to weight these costs. Finally, there are two ALL feature sets: ALL-BI includes NGRAMS, WORDS-BI and COSTS, plus features for every possible phone and diphone, and features for every specific unit in the database; ALL-TRI includes NGRAMS, WORDS-TRI, COSTS, and a feature for every phone, diphone and triphone, as well as specific units in the database.

Note that since we used the human ratings to calculate the score of the highest ranked utterance, the score of the highest ranked utterance cannot be higher than that of the highest human-rated utterance. Therefore, we effectively set the human ratings as the topline (BEST). For the baseline, we randomly chose an utterance from among the alternatives, and used its associated score. In 15 tests generating the random scores, our average scores ranged from 3.88– 4.18. We report the median score of 4.11 as the average for the baseline, along with the mean of the topline and each of the feature subsets, in Table 2.","We also report the ordering accuracy of each feature set used by the ranker in Table 2. As mentioned in Section 3.4, the ordering accuracy of the ranker using a given feature set is determined by , where is the number of correctly ordered pairs (of each paraphrase, not just the top ranked one) produced by the ranker, and is the total number of human-ranked ordered pairs.","As Table 2 indicates, the mean of BEST is 5.38, whereas our ranker using WORDS-TRI features achieves a mean score of 4.95. This is a difference of 0.42 on a seven point scale, or only a 6% difference. The ordering accuracy of WORDS-TRI is 77.3%.","We also measured the improvement of our ranker with each feature set over the random baseline as a percentage of the maximum possible gain (which would be to reproduce the human topline).

By comparison, NGRAM-1 and NGRAM-2 achieve less than 20% of the possible gain.","To verify our main hypothesis that our ranker would significantly outperform the baselines, we computed paired one-tailed -tests between WORDS-TRI and RANDOM ( , ","), and WORDS-TRI and NGRAM-1 ( ,","). Both differences were highly significant. We also performed seven post-hoc comparisons using two-tailed -tests, as we did not have an a priori expectation as to which feature set would work better. Using the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons, the - value required to achieve an overall level of significance of 0.05 is 0.007. In the first post-hoc test, we found a significant difference between BEST and WORDS-TRI ( ,","), indicating that there is room for improvement of our ranker. However, in considering the top scoring feature sets, we did not find a significant difference between WORDS-TRI and WORDS-BI ( , ), from which we infer that the difference among all of WORDS-TRI, ALL-BI, ALL-TRI and WORDS-BI is not significant also. This suggests that the synthesizer features have no substantial impact on our ranker, as we would expect ALL-TRI to be significantly higher than WORDS-TRI if so. However, since COSTS does significantly improve upon NGRAM2 ( , ), there is some value to the use of synthesizer features in the absence of WORDS. We also looked at the comparison for the WORDS models and COSTS. While WORDS-BI did not perform significantly better than COSTS ( , ), the added trigrams in WORDS-TRI did improve ranker performance significantly over COSTS ( ,","). Since COSTS ranks realizations in the much the same way as (Bulyko and Ostendorf, 2002), the fact that WORDS-TRI outperforms COSTS indicates that our discriminative reranking method can significantly improve upon their non-discriminative approach."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have presented a method for adapting a language generator to the strengths and weaknesses of a particular synthetic voice by training a discriminative reranker to select paraphrases that are predicted to sound natural when synthesized. In contrast to previous work on this topic, our method can be employed with any speech synthesizer in principle, so long as features derived from the synthesizer’s unit selection search can be made available. In a case study with the COMIC dialogue system, we have demonstrated substantial improvements in the naturalness of the resulting synthetic speech, achiev-ing two-thirds of the maximum possible gain, and raising the average rating from “ok” to “good.” We have also shown that in this study, our discriminative method significantly outperforms an approach that performs selection based solely on corpus frequencies together with target and join costs.","In future work, we intend to verify the results of our cross-validation study in a perception experiment with naı̈ve subjects. We also plan to in-vestigate whether additional features derived from the synthesizer can better detect unnatural pauses or changes in speech rate, as well as F0 contours that fail to exhibit the targeting accenting pattern. Finally, we plan to examine whether gains in quality can be achieved with an off-the-shelf, general purpose voice that are similar to those we have observed using COMIC’s limited domain voice."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We thank Mary Ellen Foster, Eric Fosler-Lussier and the anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and discussion."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Regina Barzilay and Mirella Lapata. 2005.
