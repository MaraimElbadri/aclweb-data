One such example, explored in this article, is the mention detection and recognition task in the Automatic Content Extraction project, with the goal of identifying named, nominal or pronominal references to real-world entities—mentions— and labeling them with three types of information: entity type, entity subtype and mention type. In this article, we investigate three methods of assigning these related tags and compare them on several data sets. A system based on the methods presented in this article participated and ranked very competitively in the ACE’04 evaluation."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Information extraction is a crucial step toward understanding and processing natural language data, its goal being to identify and categorize important information conveyed in a discourse. Examples of information extraction tasks are identification of the actors and the objects in written text, the detection and classification of the relations among them, and the events they participate in. These tasks have applications in, among other fields, summarization, information retrieval, data mining, question answering, and language understanding.","One of the basic tasks of information extraction is the mention detection task. This task is very similar to named entity recognition (NER), as the objects of interest represent very similar concepts. The main difference is that the latter will identify, however, only named references, while mention detection seeks named, nominal and pronominal references. In this paper, we will call the identified references mentions – using the ACE (NIST, 2003) nomenclature – to differentiate them from entities which are the real-world objects (the actual person, location, etc) to which the mentions are referring to1",".","Historically, the goal of the NER task was to find named references to entities and quantity references – time, money (MUC-6, 1995; MUC-7, 1997). In recent years, Automatic Content Extraction evaluation (NIST, 2003; NIST, 2004) expanded the task to also identify nominal and pronominal references, and to group the mentions into sets referring to the same entity, making the task more complicated, as it requires a co-reference module. The set of identified properties has also been extended to include the mention type of a reference (whether it is named, nominal or pronominal), its subtype (a more specific type dependent on the main entity type), and its genericity (whether the entity points to a specific entity, or a generic one2","), besides the customary main entity type. To our knowledge, little research has been done in the natural language processing context or otherwise on investigating the specific problem of how such multiple labels are best assigned. This article compares three methods for such an assignment.","The simplest model which can be considered for the task is to create an atomic tag by “gluing” together the sub-task labels and considering the new label atomic. This method transforms the problem into a regular sequence classification task, similar to part-of-speech tagging, text chunking, and named entity recognition tasks. We call this model the all-in-one model. The immediate drawback of this model is that it creates a large classification space (the cross-product of the sub-task classification spaces) and that, during decoding, partially similar classifications will compete instead of cooperate - more details are presented in Section 3.1. Despite (or maybe due to) its relative simplicity, this model obtained good results in several instances in the past, for POS tagging in morphologically rich languages (Hajic and Hladká, 1998) 1","In a pragmatic sense, entities are sets of mentions which co-refer. 2","This last attribute, genericity, depends only loosely on local context. As such, it should be assigned while examining all mentions in an entity, and for this reason is beyond the scope of this article."]},{"title":"473","paragraphs":["and mention detection (Jing et al., 2003; Florian et al., 2004).","At the opposite end of classification methodology space, one can use a cascade model, which performs the sub-tasks sequentially in a predefined order. Under such a model, described in Section 3.3, the user will build separate models for each sub-task. For instance, it could first identify the mention boundaries, then assign the entity type, subtype, and mention level information. Such a model has the immediate advantage of having smaller classification spaces, with the drawback that it requires a specific model invocation path.","In between the two extremes, one can use a joint model, which models the classification space in the same way as the all-in-one model, but where the classifications are not atomic. This system incorporates information about sub-model parts, such as whether the current word starts an entity (of any type), or whether the word is part of a nominal mention.","The paper presents a novel contrastive analysis of these three models, comparing them on several datasets in three languages selected from the ACE 2003 and 2004 evaluations. The methods described here are independent of the underlying classifiers, and can be used with any sequence classifiers. All experiments in this article use our in-house implementation of a maximum entropy classifier (Florian et al., 2004), which we selected because of its flexibility of integrating arbitrary types of features. While we agree that the particular choice of classifier will undoubtedly introduce some classifier bias, we want to point out that the described procedures have more to do with the organization of the search space, and will have an impact, one way or another, on most sequence classifiers, including conditional random field classifiers.3","The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the multi-task classification problem and prior work, Section 3.3 presents and contrasts the three meta-classification models. Section 4 outlines the experimental setup and the obtained results, and Section 5 concludes the paper."]},{"title":"2 Multi-Task Classification","paragraphs":["Many tasks in Natural Language Processing involve labeling a word or sequence of words with a specific property; classic examples are part-of-speech tagging, text chunking, word sense disambiguation and sentiment classification. Most of the time, the word labels are atomic labels, containing a very specific piece of information (e.g. the word","3","While not wishing to delve too deep into the issue of label bias, we would also like to point out (as it was done, for instance, in (Klein, 2003)) that the label bias of MEMM classifiers can be significantly reduced by allowing them to examine the right context of the classification point - as we have done with our model. is noun plural, or starts a noun phrase, etc). There are cases, though, where the labels consist of several related, but not entirely correlated, properties; examples include mention detection—the task we are interested in—, syntactic parsing with functional tag assignment (besides identifying the syntactic parse, also label the constituent nodes with their functional category, as defined in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993)), and, to a lesser extent, part-of-speech tagging in highly inflected languages.4","The particular type of mention detection that we are examining in this paper follows the ACE gen-eral definition: each mention in the text (a reference to a real-world entity) is assigned three types of information:5","• An entity type, describing the type of the entity it points to (e.g. person, location, organization, etc)","• An entity subtype, further detailing the type (e.g. organizations can be commercial, governmental and non-profit, while locations can be a nation, population center, or an interna-tional region)","• A mention type, specifying the way the entity is realized – a mention can be named (e.g. John Smith), nominal (e.g. professor ), or pronominal (e.g. she). Such a problem – where the classification consists of several subtasks or attributes – presents additional challenges, when compared to a standard sequence classification task. Specifically, there are inter-dependencies between the subtasks that need to be modeled explicitly; predicting the tags independently of each other will likely result in inconsistent classifications. For instance, in our running example of mention detection, the subtype task is dependent on the entity type; one could not have a person with the subtype non-profit. On the other hand, the mention type is relatively independent of the entity type and/or subtype: each entity type could be realized under any mention type and viceversa.","The multi-task classification problem has been subject to investigation in the past. Caruana et al. (1997) analyzed the multi-task learning","4","The goal there is to also identify word properties such as gender, number, and case (for nouns), mood and tense (for verbs), etc, besides the main POS tag. The task is slightly different, though, as these properties tend to have a stronger dependency on the lexical form of the classified word.","5","There is a fourth assigned type – a flag specifying whether a mention is specific (i.e. it refers at a clear entity), generic (refers to a generic type, e.g. “the scientists believe ..”), unspecified (cannot be determined from the text), or negative (e.g. “ no person would do this”). The classification of this type is beyond the goal of this paper."]},{"title":"474","paragraphs":["(MTL) paradigm, where individual related tasks are trained together by sharing a common representation of knowledge, and demonstrated that this strategy yields better results than one-task-at-a-time learning strategy. The authors used a backpropagation neural network, and the paradigm was tested on several machine learning tasks. It also contains an excellent discussion on how and why the MTL paradigm is superior to single-task learning. Florian and Ngai (2001) used the same multi-task learning strategy with a transformation-based learner to show that usually disjointly handled tasks perform slightly better under a joint model; the experiments there were run on POS tagging and text chunking, Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging. Sutton et al. (2004) investigated the multitask classification problem and used a dynamic conditional random fields method, a generalization of linear-chain conditional random fields, which can be viewed as a probabilistic generaliza-tion of cascaded, weighted finite-state transducers. The subtasks were represented in a single graphical model that explicitly modeled the sub-task dependence and the uncertainty between them. The system, evaluated on POS tagging and base-noun phrase segmentation, improved on the sequential learning strategy.","In a similar spirit to the approach presented in this article, Florian (2002) considers the task of named entity recognition as a two-step process: the first is the identification of mention boundaries and the second is the classification of the identified chunks, therefore considering a label for each word being formed from two sub-labels: one that specifies the position of the current word relative in a mention (outside any mentions, starts a mention, is inside a mention) and a label specifying the mention type . Experiments on the CoNLL’02 data show that the two-process model yields considerably higher performance.","Hacioglu et al. (2005) explore the same task, in-vestigating the performance of the AIO and the cascade model, and find that the two models have similar performance, with the AIO model having a slight advantage. We expand their study by adding the hybrid joint model to the mix, and further in-vestigate different scenarios, showing that the cascade model leads to superior performance most of the time, with a few ties, and show that the cascade model is especially beneficial in cases where partially-labeled data (only some of the component labels are given) is available. It turns out though, (Hacioglu, 2005) that the cascade model in (Hacioglu et al., 2005) did not change to a “mention view” sequence classification6","(as we did in Section 3.3) in the tasks following the entity detection, to allow the system to use longer range features. 6 As opposed to a “word view”."]},{"title":"3 Classification Models","paragraphs":["This section presents the three multi-task classification models, which we will experimentally contrast in Section 4.

Despite the above disadvantages, this model has performed well in practice: Hajic and Hladká (1998) applied it successfully to find POS sequences for Czech and Florian et al. (2004) reports good results on the 2003 ACE task. Most systems that participated in the CoNLL 2002 and 2003 shared tasks on named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) applied this model, as they modeled the identification of mention boundaries and the assignment of mention type at the same time. 3.2 The Joint Model The joint model differs from the all-in-one model in the fact that the labels are no longer atomic: the features of the system can inspect the constituent sub-labels. This change helps alleviate the data","8","From a practical point of view, it might not be very important, as the search is pruned in most cases to only a few hypotheses (beam-search); in our case, pruning the beam only introduced an insignificant model search error (0.1 F-measure).","9","To exemplify, consider that the system outputs the following classifications and probabilities: O (0.2), B-PER-NAM (0.15), B-PER-NOM (0.15); even the latter 2 suggest that the word is the start of a person mention, the O label will win because the two labels competed against each other.

Table 1 presents the set of basic features that predict the start of a mention for the CoNLL shared tasks for the two models. While the joint model can encode the start of a mention in one feature, the all-in-one model needs to use four features, resulting in fewer counts per feature and, therefore, yielding less reliably estimated features (or, conversely, it needs more data for the same estimation confidence).","• The model can predict some of the sub-tags ahead of the others (i.e. create a dependency structure on the sub-labels).

For example,","• For mention detection, identifying the mention boundaries can be considered as a primitive task.

Figure 2: Sequence tagging for mention detection: the case for a cascade model.","• For POS tagging, one can detect the main POS first, then detect the other specific properties, making use of the fact that one knows the main tag. The cascade model is essentially a factorization of individual classifiers for the sub-tasks; in this framework, we will assume that there is a more or less natural dependency structure among subtasks, and that models for each of the subtasks will be built and applied in the order defined by the dependency structure. For example, as shown in Figure 1, one can detect mention boundaries and entity type (at the same time), then detect mention type and subtype in “parallel” (i.e. no dependency exists between these last 2 sub-tags).","A very important advantage of the cascade model is apparent in classification cases where identifying chunks is involved (as is the case with mention detection), similar to advantages that rescoring hypotheses models have: in the second stage, the chunk classification stage, it can switch to a mention view, where the classification units are entire mentions and words outside of mentions. This allows the system to make use of aggregate features over the mention words (e.g. all the words are capitalized), and to also effectively use a larger Markov window (instead of 2-3 words, it will use 2-3 chunks/words around the word of interest). Figure 2 contains an example of such a case: the cascade model will have to predict the type of the entire phrase Donna Karan International, in the context ’Since <chunk> went public in ..’, which will give it a better opportunity to classify it as an organization. In contrast, because the joint model and AIO have a word view of the sentence, will lack the benefit of examining the larger region, and will not have access at features that involve partial future classifications (such as the fact that another mention of a particular type follows).","Compared with the other two models, this classification method has the following advantages:","• The classification spaces for each subtask are considerably smaller; this fact enables the creation of better estimated models","• The problem of partially-agreeing competing labels is completely eliminated","• One can easily use different/additional data to train any of the sub-task models. 3.4 Adding Partially Labeled Data Annotated data can be sometimes expensive to come by, especially if the label set is complex. But not all sub-tasks were created equal: some of them might be easier to predict than others and, therefore, require less data to train effectively in a cascade setup. Additionally, in realistic situations, some sub-tasks might be considered to have more informational content than others, and have precedence in evaluation. In such a scenario, one might decide to invest resources in annotating additional data only for the particularly interesting sub-task, which could reduce this effort significantly.","To test this hypothesis, we annotated additional data with the entity type only. The cascade model can incorporate this data easily: it just adds it to the training data for the entity type classifier model. While it is not immediately apparent how to incorporate this new data into the all-in-one and joint models, in order to maintain fairness in comparing the models, we modified the procedures to allow for the inclusion. Let T denote the original training data, and T ′","denote the additional training data.","For the all-in-one model, the additional training data cannot be incorporated directly; this is an in-herent deficiency of the AIO model.

Since a MaxEnt implementation is mostly dependent on the number of features that fire on average on a example, and not on the total number of features, the joint model runs twice as slow: the average number of features firing on a particular example is considerably higher. On average, the joint system can tag approximately 240 words per second. The train time is also considerably longer; it takes 15 times as long to train the joint model as it takes to train the all-in-one model (60 mins/iteration compared to 4 mins/iteration); the cascade model trains faster than the AIO model.","One last important fact that is worth mention-ing is that a system based on the cascade model participated in the ACE’04 competition, yielding very competitive results in all three languages."]},{"title":"479 5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["As natural language processing becomes more sophisticated and powerful, we start focus our at-tention on more and more properties associated with the objects we are seeking, as they allow for a deeper and more complex representation of the real world. With this focus comes the question of how this goal should be accomplished – either detect all properties at once, one at a time through a pipeline, or a hybrid model. This paper presents three methods through which multi-label sequence classification can be achieved, and evaluates and contrasts them on the Automatic Content Extraction task. On the ACE mention detection task, the cascade model which predicts first the mention boundaries and entity types, followed by mention type and entity subtype outperforms the simple all-in-one model in most cases, and the joint model in a few cases.","Among the proposed models, the cascade approach has the definite advantage that it can easily and productively incorporate additional partially-labeled data. We also presented a novel modifica-tion of the joint system training that allows for the direct incorporation of additional data, which in-creased the system performance significantly. The all-in-one model can only incorporate additional data in an indirect way, resulting in little to no overall improvement.","Finally, the performance obtained by the cascade model is very competitive: when paired with a coreference module, it ranked very well in the “Entity Detection and Tracking” task in the ACE’04 evaluation."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["R.
