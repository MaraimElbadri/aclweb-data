Our hypothesis is that some particular sentences, selected based on argumentative criteria, can be more useful than others to perform well-known feedback information retrieval tasks. The argumentative model we explore is based on four disjunct classes, which has been very regularly observed in scientific reports: PURPOSE, METHODS, RESULTS, CONCLUSION. To test this hypothesis, we use the Rocchio algorithm as baseline. While Rocchio selects the features to be added to the original query based on statistical evidence, we propose to base our feature selection also on argumentative criteria. Thus, we restrict the expansion on features appearing only in sentences classified into one of our argumentative categories. Our results, obtained on the OHSUMED collection, show a significant improvement when expansion is based on PURPOSE (mean average precision = +23%) and CONCLUSION (mean average precision = +41%) contents rather than on other argumentative contents. These results suggest that argumentation is an important linguistic dimension that could benefit information retrieval."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Information retrieval (IR) is a challenging endeavor due to problems caused by the underlying expressiveness of all natural languages. One of these problems, synonymy, is that authors and users frequently employ different words or expressions to refer to the same meaning (accident may be expressed as event, incident, problem, difficulty, unfortunate situation, the subject of your last letter, what happened last week, etc.) (Furnas et al., 1987). Another problem is ambiguity, where a specific term may have several (and sometimes contradictory) meanings and interpretations (e.g., the word horse as in Trojan horse, light horse, to work like a horse, horse about ). In order to obtain better meaning-based matches between queries and documents, various propositions have been suggested, usually without giving any consideration to the underlying domain.","During our participation in different international evaluation campaigns such as the TREC Genomics track (Hersh, 2005), the BioCreative initiative (Hirschman et al., 2005), as well as in our attempts to deliver advanced search tools for biologists (Ruch, 2006) and healthcare providers (Ruch, 2002) (Ruch, 2004), we were more concerned with domain-specific information retrieval in which systems must return a ranked list of MEDLINE records in response to an expert’s information request. This involved a set of available queries describing typical search interests, in which gene, protein names, and diseases were often essential for an effective retrieval. Biomedical publications however tend to generate new information very rapidly and also use a wide varia-tion in terminology, thus leading to the current situation whereby a large number of names, symbols and synonyms are used to denote the same concepts. Current solutions to these issues can be classified into domain-specific strategies, such as thesaurus-based expansion, and domain-independent strategies, such as blind-feedback. By proposing to explore a third type of approach, which attempts to take advantage of argumentative specificities of scientific reports, our study initiates a new research direction for natural language processing applied to information retrieval.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some related work in information retrieval and in argumentative parsing, while Section 3 depicts the main characteristics of our test collection and the metrics used in our experiments. Section 4 details the strategy 675 used to develop our improved feedback method. Section 5 reports on results obtained by varying our model and Section 6 contains conclusions on our experiments."]},{"title":"2 Related works","paragraphs":["Our basic experimental hypothesis is that some particular sentences, selected based on argumentative categories, can be more useful than others to support well-known feedback information retrieval tasks. It means that selecting sentences based on argumentative categories can help focusing on content-bearing sections of scientific articles. 2.1 Argumentation Originally inspired by corpus linguistics studies (Orasan, 2001), which suggests that scientific reports (in chemistry, linguistics, computer sciences, medicine...) exhibit a very regular logical distribution -confirmed by studies conducted on biomedical corpora (Swales, 1990) and by ANSI/ISO professional standards - the argumentative model we experiment is based on four disjunct classes: PURPOSE, METHODS, RESULTS, CONCLUSION.","Argumentation belongs to discourse analysis1",", with fairly complex computational models such as the implementation of the rhetorical structure theory proposed by (Marcu, 1997), which proposes dozens of rhetorical classes. More recent advances were applied to document summarization. Of particular interest for our approach, Teufel and Moens (Teufel and Moens, 1999) propose using a list of manually crafted triggers (using both words and expressions such as we argued, in this article, the paper is an attempt to, we aim at, etc.) to automatically structure scientific articles into a lighter model, with only seven categories: BACKGROUND, TOPIC, RELATED WORK, PURPOSE, METHOD, RESULT, and CONCLUSION.","More recently and for knowledge discovery in molecular biology, more elaborated models were proposed by (Mizuta and Collier, 2004) (Mizuta et al., 2005) and by (Lisacek et al., 2005) for novelty-detection. (McKnight and Srinivasan, 2003) propose a model very similar to our four-class model but is inspired by clinical trials. Preliminary applications were proposed for bib-1","After Aristotle, discourses structured following an appropriate argumentative distribution belong to logics, while ill-defined ones belong to rhetorics. liometrics and related-article search (Tbahriti et al., 2004) (Tbahriti et al., 2005), information extraction and passage retrieval (Ruch et al., 2005b). In these studies, sentences were selected as the basic classification unit in order to avoid as far as possible co-reference issues (Hirst, 1981), which hinder readibity of automatically generated and extracted sentences. 2.2 Query expansion Various query expansion techniques have been suggested to provide a better match between user information needs and documents, and to increase retrieval effectiveness. The general principle is to expand the query using words or phrases having a similar or related meaning to those appearing in the original request. Various empirical studies based on different IR models or collections have shown that this type of search strategy should usually be effective in enhancing retrieval performance. Scheme propositions such as this should consider the various relationships between words as well as term selection mechanisms and term weighting schemes (Robertson, 1990). The specific answers found to these questions may vary; thus a variety of query expansion approaches were suggested (Efthimiadis, 1996).","In a first attempt to find related search terms, we might ask the user to select additional terms to be included in a new query, e.g. (Velez et al., 1997). This could be handled interactively through displaying a ranked list of retrieved items returned by the first query. Voorhees (Voorhees, 1994) proposed basing a scheme based on the WordNet thesaurus. The author demonstrated that terms having a lexical-semantic relation with the original query words (extracted from a synonym relationship) provided very little improvement (around 1% when compared to the original unexpanded query).","As a second strategy for expanding the original query, Rocchio (Rocchio, 1971) proposed accounting for the relevance or irrelevance of top-ranked documents, according to the user’s manual input. In this case, a new query was automatically built in the form of a linear combination of the term included in the previous query and terms automatically extracted from both the relevant documents (with a positive weight) and non-relevant items (with a nega-tive weight). Empirical studies (e.g., (Salton and Buckley, 1990)) demonstrated that such an approach is usually quite effective, and could 676 be used more than once per query (Aalbersberg, 1992). Buckley et al. (Singhal et al., 1996b) suggested that we could assume, without even looking at them or asking the user, that the top k ranked documents are relevant. Denoted the pseudo-relevance feedback or blind-query expansion approach, this approach is usually effective, at least when handling relatively large text collections.","As a third source, we might use large text corpora to derive various term-term relationships, using statistically or information-based measures (Jones, 1971), (Manning and Schütze, 2000). For example, (Qiu and Frei, 1993) suggested that terms to be added to a new query could be extracted from a similarity thesaurus automatically built through calculating co-occurrence frequencies in the search collection. The underlying effect was to add idiosyncratic terms to the underlying document collection, related to the query terms by language use. When using such query expansion approaches, we can assume that the new terms are more appropriate for the retrieval of pertinent items than are lexically or semantically related terms provided by a general thesaurus or dictionary. To complement this global document analysis, (Croft, 1998) suggested that text passages (with a text window size of between 100 to 300 words) be taken into account. This local document analysis seemed to be more effective than a global term relationship generation.","As a forth source of additional terms, we might account for specific user information needs and/or the underlying domain. In this vein, (Liu and Chu, 2005) suggested that terms related to the user’s intention or scenario might be included. In the medical domain, it was observed that users looking for information usually have an underlying scenario in mind (or a typical medical task). Knowing that the number of scenarios for a user is rather limited (e.g., diagnosis, treatment, etiology), the authors suggested automatically building a semantic network based on a domain-specific thesaurus (using the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) in this case). The effectiveness of this strategy would of course depend on the quality and completeness of domain-specific knowledge sources. Using the well-known term frequency (tf)/inverse document frequency (idf) retrieval model, the domain-specific query-expansion scheme suggested by Liu and Chu (2005) produces better retrieval performance than a scheme based on statistics (MAP: 0.408 without query expansion, 0.433 using statistical methods and 0.452 with domain-specific approaches).","In these different query expansion approaches, various underlying parameters must be specified, and generally there is no single theory able to help us find the most appropriate values. Recent empirical studies conducted in the context of the TREC Genomics track, using the OHSUGEN collection (Hersh, 2005), show that neither blind expansion (Rocchio), nor domain-specific query expansion (thesaurus-based Gene and Protein expansion) seem appropriate to improve retrieval effectiveness (Aronson et al., 2006) (Abdou et al., 2006)."]},{"title":"3 Data and metrics","paragraphs":["To test our hypothesis, we used the OHSUMED collection (Hersh et al., 1994), originally developed for the TREC topic detection track, which is the most popular information retrieval collection for evaluating information search in library corpora. Alternative collections (cf. (Savoy, 2005)), such as the French Amaryllis collection, are usually smaller and/or not appropriate to evaluate our argumentative classifier, which can only process English documents. Other MEDLINE collections, which can be regarded as similar in size or larger, such as the TREC Genomics 2004 and 2005 collections are unfortunately more domain-specific since information requests in these collection are usually target-ing a particular gene or gene product.","Among the 348,566 MEDLINE citations of the OHSUMED collection, we use the 233,455 records provided with an abstract. An example of a MEDLINE citation is given in Table 1: only Title, Abstract, MeSH and Chemical (RN) fields of MEDLINE records were used for indexing. Out of the 105 queries of the OHSUMED collection, only 101 queries have at least one positive relevance judgement, therefore we used only this subset for our experiments. The subset has been randomly split into a training set (75 queries), which is used to select the different parameters of our retrieval model, and a test set (26 queries), used for our final evaluation.","As usual in information retrieval evaluations, the mean average precision, which computes the precision of the engine at different levels (0%, 10%, 20%... 100%) of recall, will be used in our experiments.

Abstract: A computerized data acquisition tool, the special purpose radiology understand-ing system (SPRUS), has been implemented as a module in the Health Evaluation through Logical Processing Hospital Information System. This tool uses semantic information from a diagnostic expert system to parse free-text radiology reports and to extract and encode both the findings and the radiologists’ interpretations. These coded findings and interpretations are then stored in a clinical data base. The system recognizes both radiologic findings and diagnostic interpretations. Initial tests showed a true-positive rate of 87% for radiographic findings and a bad data rate of 5%. Diagnostic interpretations are recognized at a rate of 95% with a bad data rate of 6%. Testing suggests that these rates can be improved through enhancements to the system’s thesaurus and the computerized medical knowledge that drives it. This system holds promise as a tool to obtain coded radiologic data for research, medical audit, and patient care.

In addition, we also provide the score obtained by the engine before the feedback step. This measure is necessary to verify that feedback is useful for query-ing the OHSUMED collection and to establish a strong baseline. While Rocchio selects the features to be added to the original queries based on pure statistical analysis, we propose to base our feature expansion also on argumentative criteria. That is, we overweight features appearing in sentences classified in a particular argumentative category by the argumentative categorizer. 4.1 Retrieval engine and indexing units The easyIR system is a standard vector-space engine (Ruch, 2004), which computes state-of-the-art tf.idf and probabilistic weighting schema. All experiments were conducted with pivoted normalization (Singhal et al., 1996a), which has recently shown some effectiveness on MEDLINE corpora (Aronson et al., 2006). Query and document weighings are provided in Equation (1): the dtu formula is applied to the documents, while the dtn formula is applied to the query; t the number of indexing terms, dfj the number of documents in which the term tj; pivot and slope are constants (fixed at pivot = 0.14, slope = 146). dtu: wij = (Ln(Ln(tfij)+1)+1)·idfj (1−slope)·pivot+slope·nti","dtn: wij = idfj ·(Ln(Ln(tfif ) + 1) + 1) (1)","As already observed in several linguistically-motivated studies (Hull, 1996), we observe that common stemming methods do not perform well on MEDLINE collections (Abdou et al., 2006), therefore indexing units are stored in the in-verted file using a simple S-stemmer (Harman, 1991), which basically handles most frequent plural forms and exceptions of the English language such as -ies, -es and -s and exclude end-ings such as -aies, -eies, -ss, etc. This simple normalization procedure performs better than others and better than no stemming. We also use a slightly modified standard stopword list of 544 items, where strings such as a, which stands for alpha in chemistry and is relevant in biomedical expressions such as vitamin a. 4.2 Argumentative categorizer The argumentative classifier ranks and categorizes abstract sentences as to their argumentative classes. To implement our argumentative categorizer, we rely on four binary Bayesian classifiers, which use lexical features, and a Markov model, which models the logical distribution of the argumentative classes in MEDLINE abstracts. A comprehensive description of the classifier with feature selection and comparative evaluation can be found in (Ruch et al., 2005a)","To train the classifier, we obtained 19,555 explicitly structured abstracts from MEDLINE.

An example of an abstract, structured with explicit argumentative labels, is given in Table 2. The per-class performance of the categorizer is given by a contingency matrix in Table 3. 4.3 Rocchio feedback Various general query expansion approaches have been suggested, and in this paper we compared ours with that of Rocchio. In this latter case, the system was allowed to add m terms extracted from the k best-ranked abstracts from the original query. Each new query was derived by applying the following formula (Equation 2): Q′","= α ·Q + (β/k) ·∑","kj = 1wij (2), in which Q′","denotes the new query built from the previous query Q, and wij denotes the indexing term weight attached to the term tj in the document Di.

Without feedback the mean average precision of the evaluation run is 0.3066, the Rocchio feedback (mean average precision = 0.353) represents an improvement of about 15% (cf. Table 5), which is statistically2","significant (p < 0.05). 4.4 Argumentative selection for","feedback To apply our argumentation-driven feedback strategy, we first have to classify the top-ranked abstracts into our four argumentative moves: PURPOSE, METHODS, RESULTS, and CONCLUSION. For the argumentative feedback, different m and k values are recomputed on the training queries, depending on the argumentative category we want to over-weight. The basic segment is the sentence; therefore the abstract is split into a set of sentences before being processed by the argumentative classifier. The sentence splitter simply applies as set of regular expressions to locate sentence boundaries. The precision of this simple sentence splitter equals 97% on MEDLINE abstracts. In this setting only one argumentative category is attributed to each sentence, which makes the decision model binary.","Table 4 shows the output of the argumentative classifier when applied to an abstract. To determine the respective value of each argumentative contents for feedback, the argumentative categorizer parses each top-ranked abstract.
