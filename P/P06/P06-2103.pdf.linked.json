Most of these efforts, however, have limited applicability. Those that use manually written rules model only the most visi-ble discourse constraints (e.g., the discourse connective “although” marks a CONCESSION relation), while being oblivious to fine-grained lexical indicators. And the methods that utilize manually an-notated corpora (Carlson et al., 2003; Karamanis et al., 2004) and supervised learning algorithms have high costs associated with the annotation procedure, and cannot be easily adapted to different domains and genres.","In contrast, more recent research has focused on stochastic approaches that model discourse coherence at the local lexical (Lapata, 2003) and global levels (Barzilay and Lee, 2004), while preserving regularities recognized by classic discourse theories (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005). These stochastic coherence models use simple, non-hierarchical representations of discourse, and can be trained with minimal human intervention, using large collections of existing human-authored documents. These models are attractive due to their increased scalability and portability. As each of these stochastic models captures different aspects of coherence, an important question is whether we can combine them in a model capable of exploiting all coherence indicators.","A frequently used testbed for coherence models is the discourse ordering problem, which occurs often in text generation, complex question answer-ing, and multi-document summarization: given  discourse units, what is the most coherent ordering of them (Marcu, 1996; Lapata, 2003; Barzilay and Lee, 2004; Barzilay and Lapata, 2005)? Because the problem is NP-complete (Althaus et al., 2005), it is critical how coherence model evaluation is intertwined with search: if the search for the best ordering is greedy and has many errors, one is not able to properly evaluate whether a model is better than another. If the search is exhaustive, the ordering procedure may take too long to be useful.","In this paper, we propose an A","search algorithm for the discourse ordering problem that comes with strong theoretical guarantees. For a wide range of practical problems (discourse ordering of up to 15 units), the algorithm finds an optimal solution in reasonable time (on the order of seconds). A beam search version of the algorithm enables one to find good, approximate solutions for very large reordering tasks. These algorithms enable us not only to compare head-to-head, for the first time, a set of coherence models, but also to combine these models so as to benefit from their complementary strengths. The model com-803 bination is accomplished using statistically well-founded utility training procedures which automatically optimize the contributions of the individual models on a development corpus. We empirically show that utility-based models of discourse coherence outperform each of the individual coherence models considered.","In the following section, we describe previously-proposed and new coherence models. Then, we present our search algorithms and the input representation they use. Finally, we show evaluation results and discuss their implications."]},{"title":"2 Stochastic Models of Discourse Coherence 2.1 Local Models of Discourse Coherence","paragraphs":["Stochastic local models of coherence work under the assumption that well-formed discourse can be characterized in terms of specific distributions of local recurring patterns. These distributions can be definedat the lexical level or entity-based levels. Word-Coocurrence Coherence Models. We propose a new coherence model, inspired by (Knight, 2003), that models the intuition that the usage of certain words in a discourse unit (sentence) tends to trigger the usage of other words in subsequent discourse units. (A similar intuition holds for the Machine Translation models generically known as the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993), which assume that certain words in a source language sentence tend to trigger the usage of certain words in a target language translation of that sentence.)","We train models able to recognize local recurring patterns of word usage across sentences in an unsupervised manner, by running an Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure over pairs of consecutive sentences extracted from a large collection of training documents1",".

Entity-based Coherence Models. Barzilay and Lapata (2005) recently proposed an entity-based coherence model that aims to learn abstract coherence properties, similar to those stipulated by Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995). Their model learns distribution patterns for transitions between discourse entities that are abstracted into their syntactic roles – subject (S), object (O), other (X), missing (-). The feature values are computed using an entity-grid representation for the discourse that records the syntactic role of each entity as it appears in each sentence. Also, salient entities are differentiated from casually occurring entities, based on the widely used assumption that occurrence frequency correlates with discourse prominence (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Grosz et al., 1995). We exclude the coreference information from this model, as the discourse ordering problem cannot accommodate current coreference solutions, which assume a pre-specifiedorder (Ng, 2005).","In the jargon of (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005), the model we implemented is called Syntax+Salience.

We use here the IDL formalism (which stands for Interleave, Disjunction, Lock, after the names of its operators) to define finite sets of possible discourses over given discourse units. Without losing generality, we will consider sentences as discourse units in our examples and experiments. 3.1 Input Representation Consider the discourse units A-C presented in Figure 1(a). Each of these units undergoes various processing stages in order to provide the information needed by our coherence models. The entity-based model (EB) (Section 2), for instance, makes use of a syntactic parser to determine the syntactic role played by each detected entity (Figure 1(b)). For example, the string SSXXXXOX- - - - - - - - - - - - (first row of the grid in Figure 1(b), corresponding to discourse unit A) encodes that"," and","","have subject (S) role,","",", etc. have other (X) roles,","has object (O) role, and the rest of the entities do not appear (-) in this unit.","In order to be able to solve Equation 1, the input representation needs to provide the necessary information to compute all","terms, that is, all individual model scores.

For instance, each","and","–labeled edge","-pair, and their source and target vertices, respectively, correspond to a  -argument","operator. In Figure 2, we show the IDL-graph corresponding to IDL-expression  . 3.2 Search Algorithms Algorithms that operate on IDL-graphs have been recently proposed by Soricut and Marcu (2005). We extend these algorithms to take as input IDL-graphs over non-atomic symbols (such that the coherence models can operate inside terms like","","",", and","from Figure 1), and also to work under models with hidden variables such as CM (Section 2.2).","These algorithm, called IDL-CH-A","(A","search for IDL-expressions under Coherence models) and IDL-CH-HB","(Histogram-Based beam search for IDL-expressions under Coherence models, with histogram beam","), assume an alphabet","of non-atomic (visible) variables (over which the input IDL-expressions are defined), and an alphabet of hidden variables.

The admissibility of the future costs and the monotonicity property enforced by the priority queue guarantees that IDL-CH-A finds an optimal solution to Equation 1 (Russell and Norvig, 1995).","The IDL-CH-HB","algorithm uses a histogram beam","to control the unfolding of an input IDL-graph, by processing, at each unfolding step, the 806 top","most inexpensive states (according to total cost). This algorithm can be tuned (via",") to achieve good trade-off between speed and accuracy. We refer the reader to (Soricut, 2006) for additional details regarding the optimality and the theoretical run-time behavior of these algorithms. 3.3 Utility-based Training In addition to the modeling problem, we must also address the training problem, which amounts to finding appropriate values for the","","parameters from Equation 1.","The solution we employ here is the discriminative training procedure of Och (2003). This procedure learns an optimal setting of the","parameters using as optimality criterion the utility of the proposed solution. There are two necessary ingredients to implement Och’s (2003) training procedure. First, it needs a search algorithm that is able to produce ranked","-best lists of the most promis-ing candidates in a reasonably fast manner (Huang and Chiang, 2005). We accommodate","-best computation within the IDL-CH-HB  ","algorithm, which decodes bag-of-units IDL-expressions at an average speed of 75.4 sec./exp. on a 3.0 GHz CPU Linux machine, for an average input of 11.5 units per expression.","Second, it needs a criterion which can automatically assess the quality of the proposed candidates. To this end, we employ two different metrics, such that we can measure the impact of using different utility functions on performance. TAU (Kendall’s","). One of the most frequently used metrics for the automatic evaluation of document coherence is Kendall’s","(Lapata, 2003; Barzilay and Lee, 2004). TAU measures the minimum number of adjacent transpositions needed to transform a proposed order into a reference order. The range of the TAU metric is between -1 (the worst) to 1 (the best). BLEU. One of the most successful metrics for judging machine-generated text is BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002). It counts the number of unigram, bigram, trigram, and four-gram matches between hypothesis and reference, and combines them using geometric mean. For the discourse ordering problem, we represent hypotheses and references by index sequences (e.g., “4 2 3 1” is a hypothesis order over four discourse units, in which the firstand last units have been swapped with respect to the reference order). The range of BLEU scores is between 0 (the worst) and 1 (the best). We run different discriminative training sessions using TAU and BLEU, and train two different sets of the","parameters for Equation 1. The log-linear models thus obtained are called Log-linear","and Log-linear",", respectively."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["We evaluate empirically two different aspects of our work. First, we measure the performance of our search algorithms across different models. Second, we compare the performance of each individual coherence model, and also the performance of the discriminatively trained log-linear models. We also compare the overall performance (model & decoding strategy) obtained in our framework with previously reported results. 4.1 Evaluation setting The task on which we conduct our evaluation is information ordering (Lapata, 2003; Barzilay and Lee, 2004; Barzilay and Lapata, 2005). In this task, a pre-selected set of information-bearing document units (in our case, sentences) needs to be arranged in a sequence which maximizes some specific information quality (in our case, document coherence). We use the information-ordering task as a means to measure the performance of our algorithms and models in a well-controlled setting. As described in Section 3, our framework can be used in applications such as multi-document summarization. In fact, Barzilay et al. (2002) formulate the multi-document summarization problem as an information ordering problem, and show that naive ordering algorithms such as majority ordering (select most frequent orders across input documents) and chronological ordering (order facts according to publication date) do not always yield coherent summaries. Data. For training and testing, we use documents from two different genres: newspaper articles and accident reports written by government officials (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005).

As the original documents were coherent, it follows that the proposed document realizations also exhibit coherence. In contrast, the greedy algorithm of Lapata (2003) makes grave search errors. As the comparison between IDL-CH-HB   and IDL-CH-HB ","shows, the superiority of the IDL-CH algorithms depends more on the admissible heuristic function","than in the ability to maintain multiple hypotheses while searching. 4.3 Evaluation of Log-linear Models For this round of experiments, we held constant the search procedure (IDL-CH-HB  ","), and varied the","parameters of Equation 1. The utility-trained log-linear models are compared here against a baseline log-linear model log-linear","",", for which all","parameters are set to 1, and also against the individual models. The results are presented in Table 2.","If not properly weighted, the log-linear combination may yield poorer results than those of individual models (average TAU of .34 for log-linear","",", versus .38 for IBM ","","and .39 for CM, on the EARTHQUAKES domain).

For both genres, the differences between the highest accuracy figures(in bold) and the accuracy of the individual models are statistically significant at 95% confidence (using bootstrap resampling). 4.4 Overall Performance Evaluation The last comparison we provide is between the performance provided by our framework and previously-reported performance results (Table 3). We are able to provide this comparison based on the TAU figures reported in (Barzilay and Lee, 2004). The training and test data for both genres is the same, and therefore the figures can be directly compared. These figures account for combined model and search performance.","We first note that, unfortunately, we failed to accurately reproduce the model of Barzilay and Lee (2004). Our reproduction has an average TAU figure of only .39 versus the original figure of .81 for EARTHQUAKES, and .36 versus .44 for ACCIDENTS. On the other hand, we reproduced successfully the model of Barzilay and Lapata (2005), and the average TAU figureis .19 for EARTHQUAKES, and .12 for ACCIDENTS3",". The large difference on the EARTHQUAKES corpus between the performance of Barzilay and Lee (2004) and our reproduction of their model is responsi-ble for the overall lower performance (0.47) of our log-linear","model and IDL-CH-HB   search algorithm, which is nevertheless higher than that of its component model CM (0.39). On the other hand, we achieve the highest accuracy figure (0.50) on the ACCIDENTS corpus, outperforming the previous-highest figure (0.44) of Barzilay and Lee (2004). These result empirically show that utility-trained log-linear models of discourse coherence outperform each of the individual coherence models considered."]},{"title":"5 Discussion and Conclusions","paragraphs":["We presented a generic framework that is capable of integrating various stochastic models of discourse coherence into a more powerful model that combines the strengths of the individual models. An important ingredient of this framework are the search algorithms based on IDL-expressions, which provide a fle xible way of solving discourse generation problems using stochastic models. Our generation algorithms are fundamentally different from previously-proposed algorithms for discourse generation. The genetic algorithms of Mellish et al. (1998) and Karamanis and Manarung (2002), as well as the greedy algorithm of Lapata (2003), provide no theoretical guarantees on the optimality of the solutions they propose. At the other end of the spectrum, the exhaustive search of Barzilay and Lee (2004), while ensuring optimal solutions, is prohibitively expensive, and cannot be used to perform utility-based training. The linear programming algorithm of Althaus et al. (2005) is the only proposal that achieves both good speed and accuracy. Their algorithm, however, cannot handle models with hidden states, cannot compute","-best lists, and does not have the representation fle xibility provided by","3","Note that these figures cannot be compared directly with the figures reported in (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005), as they use a different type of evaluation.
