Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the different dependence models. The results on the TREC 2003 test set show that the reranking approach with biterm language model, significantly outperforms the one with the bag-of-words model and unigram language model by 14.9% and 12.5% respectively in F-Measure(5)."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In recent years, QA systems in TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) have made remarkable progress (Voorhees, 2002). The task of TREC QA before 2003 has mainly focused on the factoid questions, in which the answer to the question is a number, a person name, or an organization name, or the like.","Questions like “Who is Colin Powell?” or “What is mold?” are definitional questions * This work was finished while the first author was visiting Microsoft Research Asia during March 2005-March 2006 as a component of the project of AskBill Chatbot led by Dr. Ming Zhou. (Voorhees, 2003). Statistics from 2,516 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) extracted from Internet FAQ Archives1","show that around 23.6% are definitional questions. This indicates that definitional questions occur frequently and are important question types. TREC started the evaluation for definitional QA in 2003. The definitional QA systems in TREC are required to extract definitional nuggets/sentences that contain the highly descriptive information about the question target from a given large corpus.","For definitional question, statistical ranking methods based on centroid vector (profile) extracted from external resources, such as the online encyclopedia, are widely adopted in the top systems in TREC 2003 and 2004 (Xu et al., 2003; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2004). In these systems, for a given question, a vector is formed consisting of the most frequent co-occurring terms with the question target as the question profile. Candidate answers extracted from a given large corpus are ranked based on their similarity to the question profile. The similarity is normally the TFIDF score in which both the candidate answer and the question profile are treated as a bag of words in the framework of Vector Space Model (VSM).","VSM is based on an independence assumption, which assumes that terms in a vector are statistically independent from one another. Although this assumption makes the development of retrieval models easier and the retrieval operation tractable, it does not hold in textual data. For example, for question “Who is Bill Gates?” words “born” and “1955” in the candidate answer are not independent.","In this paper, we are interested in considering the term dependence to improve the answer reranking for definitional QA. Specifically, the 1 http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ 1081 language model is utilized to capture the term dependence. A language model is a probability distribution that captures the statistical regularities of natural language use. In a language model, key elements are the probabilities of word sequences, denoted as P(w1, w2, ..., wn) or P (w1,n) for short. Recently, language model has been successfully used for information retrieval (IR) (Ponte and Croft, 1998; Song and Croft, 1998; Lafferty et al., 2001; Gao et al., 2004; Cao et al., 2005). Our natural thinking is to apply language model to rank the candidate answers as it has been applied to rank search results in IR task.","The basic idea of our research is that, given a definitional question q, an ordered centroid OC which is learned from the web and a language model LM(OC) which is trained with it. Candidate answers can be ranked by probability estimated by LM(OC). A series of experiments on standard TREC 2003 collection have been conducted to evaluate bigram and biterm language models. Results show that both these two language models produce promising results by capturing the term dependence and biterm model achieves the best performance. Biterm language model interpolating with unigram model significantly improves the VSM and unigram model by 14.9% and 12.5% in F-Measure(5).","In the rest of this paper, Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 presents details of the proposed method. Section 4 introduces the structure of our experimental system. We show the experimental results in Section 5, and conclude the paper in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Web information has been widely used for answer reranking and validation. For factoid QA task, AskMSR (Brill et al., 2001) ranks the answers by counting the occurrences of candidate answers returned from a search engine. Similarly, DIOGENE (Magnini et al., 2002) applies search engines to validate candidate answers.","For definitional QA task, Lin (2002) presented an approach in which web-based answer reranking is combined with dictionary-based (e.g., WordNet) reranking, which leads to a 25% in-crease in mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Xu et al. (2003) proposed a statistical ranking method based on centroid vector (i.e., vector of words and frequencies) learned from the online encyclopedia (i.e., Wikipedia 2 ) and the web. Candi-2 http://www.wikipedia.org date answers were reranked based on their similarity (TFIDF score) to the centroid vector. Similar techniques were explored in (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2003). In this paper, we explore the dependence among terms in centroid vector for improving the answer reranking for definitional QA.","In recent years, language modeling has been widely employed in IR (Ponte and Croft, 1998; Song and Croft, 1998; Miller and Zhai, 1999; Lafferty and Zhai, 2001). The basic idea is to compute the conditional probability P(Q|D), i.e., the probability of generating a query Q given the observation of a document D. The searched documents are ranked in descending order of this probability.","Song and Croft (1998) proposed a general language model to incorporate word dependence by using bigrams. Srikanth and Srihari (2002) introduced biterm language models similar to the bigram model except that the constraint of order in terms is relaxed and improved performance was observed. Gao et al. (2004) presented a new method of capturing word dependencies, in which they extended state-of-the-art language modeling approaches to information retrieval by introducing a dependence structure that learned from training data. Cao et al. (2005) proposed a novel dependence model to incorporate both relationships of WordNet and co-occurrence with the language modeling framework for IR. In our approach, we propose bigram and biterm models to capture the term dependence in centroid vector.","Applying language modeling for the QA task has not been widely researched. Zhang D. and Lee (2003) proposed a method using language model for passage retrieval for the factoid QA. They trained two language models, in which one was the question-topic language model and the other was passage language model. They utilized the divergence between the two language models to rank passages. In this paper, we focus on reranking answers for definitional questions.","As other ranking approaches, Xu, et al. (2005) formalized ranking definitions as classification problems, and Cui et al. (2004) proposed soft patterns to rank answers for definitional QA."]},{"title":"3 Reranking Answers Using Language Model 3.1 Model background","paragraphs":["In practice, language model is often approximated by N-gram models.","Unigram: 1082","(1) 211 ))...P(w)P(wP(w)P(w n,n =","Bigram:","(2) 11211 )|w)...P(w|w)P(wP(w)P(w n-n,n =","The unigram model makes a strong assumption that each word occurs independently.

It involves: 1) learning a language model from the web; 2) adopting the language model to rerank candidate answers; 3) removing redundancies. Figure 1 shows five main modules. Learning ordered centroid: 1) Query expansion. Definitional questions are normally short (i.e., who is Bill Gates?). Query expansion is used to refine the query intention. First, reformulate query via simply adding clue words to the questions. i.e., for “Who is ...?” question, we add the word “biography”; and for “What is ...?” question, we add the word “is usually”, “refers to”, etc. We learn these clue words using the similar method proposed in (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002). Second, query a web search engine (i.e., Google 4",") with reformulated query and learn top-R (we empirically set R=5) most frequent co-occurring terms with the target from returned snippets as query expansion terms; 2) Learning centroid vector (profile). We query Google again with the target and expanded terms learned in the previous step, download top-N (we empirically set N=500 based on the tradeoff between the snippet number and the time complexity) snippets, and split snippets into sentences. Then, we retain the generated sentences that contain the target, denoted as W. Finally, learn top-M (We empirically set M=350) most frequent co-3 The test data for TREC-13 includes 65 definition questions.

For each sentence in W, we retain the terms in the centroid vector as the ordered centroid list.

Extracting candidate answers: We extract can-didates from AQUAINT corpus. 1) Querying AQUAINT corpus with the target and retrieve relevant documents; 2) Splitting documents into sentences and extracting the sentences containing the target. Here in order to improve recall, simple heuristics rules are used to handle the problem of coreference resolution. If a sentence is deemed to contain the target and its next sentence starts with “he”, “she”, “it”, or “they”, then the next sentence is retained. Training language models: As mentioned above, we train language models using the obtained ordered centroid for each question. Answer reranking: Once the language models and the candidate answers are ready for a given question, candidate answers are reranked based on the probabilities of the language models generating candidate answers.

More details will be shown in the following sections. 5.1 Experiment setup 5.1.1 Dataset We employ the dataset from the TREC 2003 QA task. It includes the AQUAINT corpus of more than 1 million news articles from the New York Times (1998-2000), Associated Press (1998-2000), Xinhua News Agency (1996-2000) and 50 definitional question/answer pairs. In these 50 definitional questions, 30 are for people (e.g., Aaron Copland), 10 are for organizations (e.g., Friends of the Earth) and 10 are for other entities (e.g., Quasars). We employ Lemur 6","to retrieve relevant documents from the AQUAINT corpus. For each query, we return the top 500 documents. 5.1.2 Evaluation metrics We adopt the evaluation metrics used in the TREC definitional QA task (Voorhees, 2003 and 2004). TREC provides a list of essential and acceptable nuggets for answering each question. We use these nuggets to assess our approach. During this progress, two human assessors examine how many essential and acceptable nuggets are covered in the returned answers. Every question is scored using nugget recall (NR) and an approximation to nugget precision (NP) based on answer length. The final score for a definition response is computed using F-Measure. In TREC 2003, the β parameter was set to 5 indicating that recall is 5 times as important as precision (Voorhees, 2003). 6 A free IR tool, http://www.lemurproject.org/ (14)",")15( 5 )5( 2 2 NRNP NRNP F","++ ∗∗ ==β in which,","(15) uggetsl answer n# essentia returnedl nuggets # essentia","NR =","(16) )(otherwise , 1 )( ,1     < = lengthallowance)(length - -","allowancelength NP where allowance = 100 * (# essential + # acceptable nuggets returned) and length = # nonwhite space characters in strings returned. 5.1.3 Baseline system We employ the TFIDF heuristics algorithm-based approach as our baseline system, in which the candidate answers and the centroid are treated as a bag of words.","(17) ln","iiiii","DFNTFIDFTFweight ∗=∗= where TFi gives the occurrences of term i.

The main difference is that we only concern unigram probability P(ti|OC) in unigram-based scoring function.","For all systems, we empirically set the threshold of answer length to 12 sentences for people targets (i.e., Aaron Copland), and 10 sentences for other targets (i.e., Quasars). 5.2 Performance evaluation As the first evaluation, we assess the performance obtained by our language model method against the baseline system without query expansion (QE).

The unigram slightly outperform the baseline. We also notice that the biterm model improves slightly over the bigram model since it ignores the order of term-occurrence. This observation coincides with the experimental results of Srikanth and Srihari (2002). These results show that the bigram and biterm models outperform the VSM model and the unigram model dramatically. It is a clear indication that the language model which takes into account the term dependence among centroid vector is an effective way to rerank answers.","As mentioned above, QE is involved in our system. In the second evaluation, we assess the performance obtained by the language model method against the baseline system with QE. We list the evaluation results in Table 2.

Furthermore, the bigram and biterm perform significantly better than the unigram by 9.7% (p=0.07) and 12.5% (p=0.02) in F(5) respectively. This indicates that the term dependence is effective in keeping improving the performance. It is easy to observe that the baseline is close to the unigram model since both two systems are based on the independent assumption. We also notice that the biterm model improves slightly over the bigram model. At the same time, all of the four systems improve the performance against the correspond-ing system without QE. The main reason is that the qualities of the centroid vector can be enhanced with QE. We are interested in the performance comparison with or without QE for each system. Through comparison it is found that the baseline system relies on QE more heavily than our approach does.
