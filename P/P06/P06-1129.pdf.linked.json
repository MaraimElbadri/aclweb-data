Such statistics indicate that a good query speller is crucial to search engine in improving web search relevance, because there is little opportunity that a search engine can retrieve many relevant contents with misspelled terms.","The problem of designing a spelling correction program for web search queries, however, poses special technical challenges and cannot be well solved by general purpose spelling correction methods. Cucerzan and Brill (2004) discussed in detail specialties and difficulties of a query spell checker, and illustrated why the existing methods could not work for query spelling correction. They also identified that no single evidence, either a conventional spelling lexicon or term frequency in the query logs, can serve as criteria for validate queries.","To address these challenges, we concentrate on the problem of learning improved query spelling correction model by integrating distributional similarity information automatically derived from query logs. The key contribution of our work is identifying that we can successfully use the evidence of distributional similarity to achieve better spelling correction accuracy. We present two methods that are able to take advantage of distributional similarity information. The first method extends a string edit-based error model with confusion probabilities within a generative source channel model. The second method explores the effectiveness of our approach within a discriminative maximum entropy model framework by integrating distributional similarity-based features. Experimental results demonstrate that both methods can significantly outperform their baseline systems in the spelling correction task for web search queries. 1025","The rest of the paper is structured as follows: after a brief overview of the related work in Section 2, we discuss the motivations for our approach, and describe two methods that can make use of distributional similarity information in Section 3. Experiments and results are presented in Section 4. The last section contains summaries and outlines promising future work."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["The method for web query spelling correction proposed by Cucerzan and Brill (2004) is essentially based on a source channel model, but it requires iterative running to derive suggestions for very-difficult-to-correct spelling errors. Word bigram model trained from search query logs is used as the source model, and the error model is approximated by inverse weighted edit distance of a correction candidate from its original term. The weights of edit operations are interactively optimized based on statistics from the query logs. They observed that an edit distance-based error model only has less impact on the overall accuracy than the source model. The paper reports that un-weighted edit distance will cause the overall accuracy of their speller’s output to drop by around 2%. The work of Ahmad and Kondrak (2005) tried to employ an unsupervised approach to error model estimation. They designed an EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm to optimize the probabilities of edit operations over a set of search queries from the query logs, by exploiting the fact that there are more than 10% misspelled queries scattered throughout the query logs. Their method is concerned with single character edit operations, and evaluation was performed on an isolated word spelling correction task.","There are two lines of research in conventional spelling correction, which deal with non-word errors and real-word errors respectively. Non-word error spelling correction is concerned with the task of generating and ranking a list of possible spelling corrections for each query word not found in a lexicon. While traditionally candidate ranking is based on manually tuned scores such as assigning weights to different edit operations or leveraging candidate frequencies, some statistical models have been proposed for this ranking task in recent years. Brill and Moore (2000) presented an improved error model over the one proposed by Kernigham et al. (1990) by allowing generic string-to-string edit operations, which helps with modeling major cognitive errors such as the confusion between le and al. Toutanova and Moore (2002) further explored this via explicit modeling of phonetic information of English words. Both these two methods require misspelled/correct word pairs for training, and the latter also needs a pronunciation lexicon. Real-word spelling correction is also referred to as context sensitive spelling correction, which tries to detect incorrect usage of valid words in certain contexts (Golding and Roth, 1996; Mangu and Brill, 1997).","Distributional similarity between words has been investigated and successfully applied in many natural language tasks such as automatic semantic knowledge acquisition (Dekang Lin, 1998) and language model smoothing (Essen and Steinbiss, 1992; Dagan et al., 1997). An investigation on distributional similarity functions can be found in (Lillian Lee, 1999)."]},{"title":"3 Distributional Similarity-Based Models for Query Spelling Correction","paragraphs":["3.1 Motivation Most of the previous work on spelling correction concentrates on the problem of designing better error models based on properties of character strings. This direction ever evolves from simple Damerau-Levenshtein distance (Damerau, 1964; Levenshtein, 1966) to probabilistic models that estimate string edit probabilities from corpus (Church and Gale, 1991; Mayes et al, 1991; Ristad and Yianilos, 1997; Brill and Moore, 2000; and Ahmad and Kondrak, 2005). In the mentioned methods, however, the similarities between two strings are modeled on the average of many misspelling-correction pairs, which may cause many idiosyncratic spelling errors to be ignored. Some of those are typical word-level cognitive errors. For instance, given the query term adventura, a character string-based error model usually assigns similar similarities to its two most probable corrections adventure and aventura. Taking into account that adventure has a much higher frequency of occurring, it is most likely that adventure would be generated as a suggestion. However, our observation into the query logs reveals that adventura in most cases is actually a common misspelling of aventura. Two annotators were asked to judge 36 randomly sampled queries that contain more than one term, and they agreed upon that 35 of them should be aventura.","To solve this problem, we consider alternative methods to make use of the information beyond a 1026 term’s character strings. Distributional similarity provides such a dimension to view the possibility that one word can be replaced by another based on the statistics of words co-occuring with them. Distributional similarity has been proposed to perform tasks such as language model smoothing and word clustering, but to the best of our knowledge, it has not been explored in estimat-ing similarities between misspellings and their corrections. In this section, we will only involve the consine metric for illustration purpose.","Query logs can serve as an excellent corpus for distributional similarity estimation. This is because query logs are not only an up-to-date term base, but also a comprehensive spelling error repository (Cucerzan and Brill, 2004; Ahmad and Kondrak, 2005). Given enough size of query logs, some misspellings, such as adventura, will occur so frequently that we can obtain reliable statistics of their typical usage. Essential to our method is the observation of high distributional similarity between frequently occurring spelling errors and their corrections, but low between irrelevant terms. For example, we observe that adventura occurred more than 3,300 times in a set of logged queries that spanned three months, and its context was similar to that of aventura. Both of them usually appeared after words like peurto and lyrics, and were followed by mall, palace and resort. Further computation shows that, in the tf (term frequency) vector space based on surrounding words, the cosine value between them is approximately 0.8, which indicates these two terms are used in a very similar way among all the users trying to search aventura. The cosine between adventura and adventure is less than 0.03 and basically we can conclude that they are two irrelevant terms, although their spellings are similar.","Distributional similarity is also helpful to address another challenge for query spelling correction: differentiating valid OOV terms from frequently occurring misspellings.","","InLex Freq Cosine vaccum No 18,430 vacuum Yes 158,428 0.99 seraphin No 1,718 seraphim Yes 14,407 0.30","Table 1. Statistics of two word pairs with similar spellings  Table 1 lists detailed statistics of two word pairs, each of pair of words have similar spelling, lexicon and frequency properties. But the distributional similarity between each pair of words provides the necessary information to make correction classification that vacuum is a spelling error while seraphin is a valid OOV term. 3.2 Problem Formulation In this work, we view the query spelling correction task as a statistical sequence inference problem. Under the probabilistic model framework, it can be conceptually formulated as follows. Given a correction candidate set C for a query string q: }),(|{ d<= cqEditDistcC in which each correction candidate c satisfies the constraint that the edit distance between c and q is less than a given threshold δ, the model is to find c* in C with the highest probability:",")|(maxarg* qcPc Cc=̨ (1)","In practice, the correction candidate set C is not generated from the entire query string directly. Correction candidates are generated for each term of a query first, and then C is constructed by composing the candidates of individual terms. The edit distance threshold δ is set for each term proportionally to the length of the term. 3.3 Source Channel Model Source channel model has been widely used for spelling correction (Kernigham et al., 1990; Mayes, Damerau et al., 1991; Brill and More, 2000; Ahmad and Kondrak, 2005). Instead of directly optimize (1), source channel model tries to solve an equivalent problem by applying Bayes’s rule and dropping the constant denominator:",")()|(maxarg* cPcqPc Cc=̨ (2)","In this approach, two component generative models are involved: source model P(c) that generates the user’s intended query c and error model P(q|c) that generates the real query q given c. These two component models can be independently estimated.","In practice, for a multi-term query, the source model can be approximated with an n-gram statistical language model, which is estimated with tokenized query logs. Taking bigram model for example, c is a correction candidate containing n terms, ncccc ...21= , then P(c) can be written as the product of consecutive bigram probabilities: -= )|()( 1ii ccPcP 1027","Similarly, the error model probability of a query is decomposed into generation probabilities of individual terms which are assumed to be independently generated:","= )|()|( ii cqPcqP","Previous proposed methods for error model estimation are all based on the similarity between the character strings of qi and ci as described in 3.1.

Compared to other similarity measures such as cosine or Euclidean distance, confusion probability is of interest because it defines a probabilistic distribution rather than a generic measure. This property makes it more theoretically sound to be used as error model probability in the Bayesian framework of the source channel model. Thus it can be applied and evaluated independently. However, before using confusion probability as our error model, we have to solve two problems: probability renormalization and smoothing.","Unlike string edit-based error models, which distribute a major portion of probability over terms with similar spellings, confusion probability distributes probability over the entire vocabulary in the training data. This property may cause the problem of unfair comparison between different correction candidates if we directly use (3) as the error model probability. This is because the synonyms of different candidates may share different portion of confusion probabilities. This problem can be solved by re-normalizing the probabilities only over a term’s possible correction candidates and itself. To obtain better estimation, here we also require that the frequency of a correction candidate should be higher than that of the query term, based on the observation that correct spellings generally occur more often in query logs.

The maximum entropy model (Berger et al., 1996) provides us with a well-founded framework for this purpose, which has been extensively used in natural lan guage processing tasks ranging from part-of-speech tagging to machine translation.","For our task, the maximum entropy model defines a posterior probabilistic distribution",")|( qcP over a set of feature functions fi (q, c) defined on an input query q and its correction candidate c:"]},{"title":"∑ ∑∑","paragraphs":["=","=","= c N i ii N i ii qcf qcf qcP 1 1 ),(exp ),(exp )|( l l (6) 1028 where λs are feature weights, which can be optimized by maximizing the posterior probability on the training set:"]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["̨ = TDqt qtP","),( )|(logmaxarg* l ll where TD denotes the set of training samples in the form of query-truth pairs presented to the training algorithm.","We use the Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS) algorithm (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972) to learn the model parameter λs of the maximum entropy model. GIS training requires normalization over all possible prediction classes as shown in the denominator in equation (6). Since the potential number of correction candidates may be huge for multi-term queries, it would not be practical to perform the normalization over the entire search space. Instead, we use a method to approximate the sum over the n-best list (a list of most probable correction candidates). This is similar to what Och and Ney (2002) used for their maximum entropy-based statistical machine transla-tion training. 3.4.1 Features Features used in our maximum entropy model are classified into two categories I) baseline features and II) features supported by distributional similarity evidence.

For each query identified to contain spelling errors, corrections were given by the annotators independently. From the annotation results that both annotators agreed upon 3,061 queries were extracted, which were further divided into a test set containing 1,031 queries and a training set containing 2,030 queries. In the test set there are 171 queries identified containing spelling errors with an error rate of 16.6%. The numbers on the training set is 312 and 15.3%, respectively. The average length of queries on training set is 2.8 terms and on test set it is 2.6. 1029","In our experiments, a term bigram model is used as the source model. The bigram model is trained with query log data of MSN Search dur-ing the period from October 2004 to June 2005.

For source channel model, we compared the confusion probability-based error model (SC-SimCM) against two baseline error model settings, which are source model only (SC-NoCM) and the heuristic string edit-based error model (SC-EdCM) we just described. Two maximum entropy models were trained with different feature sets. ME-NoSim is the model trained only with baseline features. It serves as the baseline for ME-Full, which is trained with all the features described in 3.4.1. In training ME-Full, cosine distance is used as the similarity measure examined by feature functions.","In all the experiments we used the standard viterbi algorithm to search for the best output of source channel model. The n-best list for maximum entropy model training and testing is generated based on language model scores of correction candidates, which can be easily obtained by running the forward-viterbi backward-A* algorithm. On a 3.0GHZ Pentium4 personal computer, the system can process 110 queries per second for source channel model and 86 queries per second for maximum entropy model, in which 20 best correction candidates are used."," Model Accuracy Recall Precision SC-NoCM 79.7% 63.3% 40.2% SC-EdCM 84.1% 62.7% 47.4% SC-SimCM 88.2% 57.4% 58.8% ME-NoSim 87.8% 52.0% 60.0% ME-Full 89.0% 60.4% 62.6% Table 2. Performance results for different models ","Table 2 details the performance scores for the experiments, which shows that both of the two distributional similarity-based models boost accuracy over their baseline settings. SC-SimCM achieves 26.3% reduction in error rate over SC-EdCM, which is significant to the 0.001 level (paired t-test). ME-Full outperforms ME-NoSim in all three evaluation measures, with 9.8% reduction in error rate and 16.2% improvement in recall, which is significant to the 0.01 level.","It is interesting to note that the accuracy of SC-SimCM is slightly better than ME-NoSim, although ME-NoSim makes use of a rich set of features. ME-NoSim tends to keep queries with frequently misspelled terms unchanged (e.g. caffine extractions from soda) to reduce false alarms (e.g. bicycle suggested for biocycle).","We also investigated the performance of the models discussed above at different recall.
