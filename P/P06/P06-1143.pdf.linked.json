Abbas Malik Department of Linguistics Denis Diderot, University of Paris 7 Paris, France abbas.malik@gmail.com    Abstract","paragraphs":["Machine Transliteration is to transcribe a word written in a script with approximate phonetic equivalence in another language. It is useful for machine translation, cross-lingual information retrieval, multilingual text and speech processing. Punjabi Machine Transliteration (PMT) is a special case of machine transliteration and is a process of converting a word from Shahmukhi (based on Arabic script) to Gurmukhi (derivation of Landa, Shardha and Takri, old scripts of Indian subcontinent), two scripts of Punjabi, irrespective of the type of word. The Punjabi Machine Transliteration System uses transliteration rules (character mappings and dependency rules) for transliteration of Shahmukhi words into Gurmukhi. The PMT system can transliterate every word written in Shahmukhi."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Punjabi is the mother tongue of more than 110 million people of Pakistan (66 million), India (44 million) and many millions in America, Canada and Europe. It has been written in two mutually incomprehensible scripts Shahmukhi and Gurmukhi for centuries. Punjabis from Pakistan are unable to comprehend Punjabi written in Gurmukhi and Punjabis from India are unable to comprehend Punjabi written in Shahmukhi. In contrast, they do not have any problem to understand the verbal expression of each other. Punjabi Machine Transliteration (PMT) system is an effort to bridge the written communication gap between the two scripts for the benefit of the millions of Punjabis around the globe.","Transliteration refers to phonetic translation across two languages with different writing systems (Knight & Graehl, 1998), such as Arabic to English (Nasreen & Leah, 2003). Most prior work has been done for Machine Translation (MT) (Knight & Leah, 97; Paola & Sanjeev, 2003; Knight & Stall, 1998) from English to other major languages of the world like Arabic, Chinese, etc. for cross-lingual information retrieval (Pirkola et al, 2003), for the development of multilingual resources (Yan et al, 2003; Kang & Kim, 2000) and for the development of cross-lingual applications.","PMT is a special kind of machine transliteration. It converts a Shahmukhi word into a Gurmukhi word irrespective of the type constraints of the word. It not only preserves the phonetics of the transliterated word but in contrast to usual transliteration, also preserves the meaning.","Two scripts are discussed and compared. Based on this comparison and analysis, character mappings between Shahmukhi and Gurmukhi are drawn and transliteration rules are discussed. Finally, architecture and process of the PMT system are discussed. When it is applied to Punjabi Unicode encoded text especially designed for testing, the results were complied and analyzed. PMT system will provide basis for Cross-Scriptural Information Retrieval (CSIR) and Cross-Scriptural Application Development (CSAD)."]},{"title":"2 Punjabi Machine Transliteration","paragraphs":["According to Paola (2003), “When writing a foreign name in one’s native language, one tries to preserve the way it sounds, i.e. one uses an or-thographic representation which, when read aloud by the native speaker of the language, sounds as it would when spoken by a speaker of the foreign language – a process referred to as Transliteration”. Usually, transliteration is referred to phonetic translation of a word of some 1137 specific type (proper nouns, technical terms, etc) across languages with different writing systems. Native speakers may not understand the meaning of transliterated word.","PMT is a special type of Machine Transliteration in which a word is transliterated across two different writing systems used for the same language.

It is a right-to-left script and the shape assumed by a character in a word is context sensitive, i.e. the shape of a character is different depending whether the position of the character is at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of the word.

One is Arabic based cursive and the other is syllabic. But both of them represent the phonetic repository of Punjabi. These phonetic sounds are used to determine the relation between the characters of two scripts. On the basis of this idea, character mappings are determined.","For the analysis and comparison, both scripts are subdivided into different group on the basis of types of characters e.g. consonants, vowels, diacritical marks, etc. 4.1 Consonant Mapping Consonants can be further subdivided into two groups:","Aspirated Consonants: There are sixteen aspirated consonants in Punjabi (Malik, 2005). Ten of these aspirated consonants (JJ[bh], JJ[ph], JJ[ṱh], JJ[ʈh], bY[ʤh], bb[ʧh], |e[ḓh], |e[ɖh], ÏÏ[kh], ÏÏ[gh]) are very frequently used in Punjabi as compared to the remaining six aspirates (|g[rh], |h[ɽh], Ïà[lh], Jb[mh], JJ[nh], |z[vh]). In Shahmukhi, aspirated consonants are represented by the combination of a consonant (to be aspirated) and HEH-DOACHASHMEE (|). For example [ [b] + | [h] = JJ [bh] and ̀[ʤ] + | [h] = Yb [ʤh].","In Gurmukhi, each frequently used aspirated-consonant is represented by a unique character. But, less frequent aspirated consonants are represented by the combination of a consonant (to be aspirated) and sub-joined PAIREEN HAAHAA e.g. ਲ [l] + ◌੍ + ਹ [h] = ਲ (Ïà) [lh] and ਵ [v] + ◌੍ + ਹ [h] = ਵ )|z( [vh], where ◌੍ is the sub-joiner. The sub-joiner character (◌੍) tells that the following ਹ [h] is going to change the shape of PAIREEN HAAHHA.","The mapping of ten frequently used aspirated consonants is given in Table 1.

On the other hand there are more then one characters for a single sound in Shahmukhi. For example, Seh 1138 (_), Seen (k) and Sad (m) represent [s] and [s] has one equivalent in Gurmukhi i.e. Sassaa (ਸ). Similarly other characters like ਅ [a], ਤ [ṱ], ਹ [h] and ਜ਼ [z] have multiple equivalents in Shahmukhi. Non-aspirated consonants mapping is given in Table 2.

In Shahmukhi, these vowels are represented with help of four long vowels (Alef Madda (W), Alef (Z), Vav (z) and Choti Yeh (~)) and three short vowels (Arabic Fatha – Zabar (F◌), Arabic Damma – Pesh (E◌) and Arabic Kasra – Zer (G◌)). Note that the last two long vowels are also used as consonants. Hamza (Y) is a special character and always comes between two vowel sounds as a place holder. For example, in õGõ66W [ɑsɑɪʃ] (comfort), Hamza (Y) is separating two vowel sounds Alef (Z) and Zer (G◌), in zW [ɑo] (come), Hamza (Y) is separating two vowel sounds Alef Madda (W) [ɑ] and Vav (z) [o], etc. In the first example õGõ66W [ɑsɑɪʃ] (comfort), Hamza (Y) is separating two vowel sounds Alef (Z) and Zer (G◌), but normally Zer (G◌) is dropped by common people. So Hamza (Y) is mapped on ਇ [ɪ] when it is followed by a consonant.","In Gurmukhi, vowels are represented by ten independent vowel characters (ਅ, ਆ, ਇ, ਈ, ਉ, ਊ, ਏ, ਐ, ਓ, ਔ) and nine dependent vowel signs (◌ਾ, ਿ◌, ◌ੀ, ◌ੁ, ◌ੂ, ◌ੇ, ◌ੈ, ◌ੋ, ◌ੌ). When a vowel sound comes at the start of a word or is independent of some consonant in the middle or end of a word, independent vowels are used; other-wise dependent vowel signs are used.

Table 4: Vowels Analysis of Punjabi for PMT 1140 4.3 Sub-Joins (PAIREEN) of Gurmukhi There are three PAIREEN (sub-joins) in Gurmukhi, “Haahaa”, “Vaavaa” and “Raaraa” shown in Table 5. For PMT, if HEH-DOACHASHMEE (|) does come after the less frequently used aspirated consonants then it is transliterated into PAIREEN Haahaa. Other PAIREENS are very rare in their usage and are used only in Sanskrit loan words. In present day writings, PAIREEN Vaavaa and Raaraa are being replaced by normal Vaavaa (ਵ) and Raaraa (ਰ) respectively.

There are sixteen diacritical marks in Shahmukhi and nine dependent vowel sings in Gurmukhi (Malik, 2005). The mapping of diacritical marks is given in Table 6.

But they are sparingly used in writing by common people. In the normal text of Shahmukhi books, newspapers, and magazines etc. one will not find the diacritical marks. The pronunciation of a word and its meaning would be comprehended with the help of the context in which it is used."," For example,"]},{"title":"E} FZ uuu ~ww ~hâa }ZX @ð~ ~hâa }Z wiX","paragraphs":["In the first sentence, the word ~hâa is pronounced as [ʧɔɽi] and it conveys the meaning of ‘wide’.

There should be Zabar (F◌) after Cheh (a) and Pesh (E◌) after Cheh (a) in the first and second words respectively, to remove the ambiguities.","It is clear from the above example that diacritical marks are essential for removing ambiguities, natural language processing and speech synthesis. 4.5 Other Symbols Punctuation marks in Gurmukhi are the same as in English, except the full stop. DANDA (।) and double DANDA (॥) of Devanagri script are used for the full stop instead. In case of Shahmukhi, these are same as in Arabic.

They require certain dependency or contextual rules for producing correct transliteration. The basic idea behind these rules is the same as that of the character mappings. These rules in-clude rules for aspirated consonants, non-aspirated consonants, Alef (Z), Alef Madda (W), Vav (z), Choti Yeh (~) etc. Only some of these rules are discussed here due to space limitations.","Rules for Consonants: Shahmukhi consonants are transliterated into their equivalent 1141 Gurmukhi consonants e.g. k → ਸ [s]. Any diacritical mark except Shadda (H◌) is ignored at this point and is treated in rules for vowels or in rules for diacritical marks. In Shahmukhi, Shadda (H◌) is placed after the consonant but in Gurmukhi, its equivalent Addak (◌ੱ) is placed before the consonant e.g. \\ + H◌ → ◌ੱਪ [pp]. Both Shadda (H◌) and Addak (◌ੱ) double the sound a consonant","after or before which they are placed. This rule is applicable to all consonants in Table 1 and 2 except Ain (q), Noon (y), Noonghunna (y), Vav (z), Heh Gol ({), Dochashmee Heh (|), Choti Yeh (~) and Baree Yeh (}). These characters are treated separately. Rule for Hamza (Y): Hamza (Y) is a special character of Shahmukhi. Rules for Hamza (Y) are: − If Hamza (Y) is followed by Choti Yeh (~), then Hamza (Y) and Choti Yeh (~) will be transliterated into ਈ [i]. − If Hamza (Y) is followed by Baree Yeh (}), then Hamza (Y) and Baree Yeh (}) will be transliterated into ਏ [e]. − If Hamza (Y) is followed by Zer (G◌), then Hamza (Y) and Zer (G◌) will be transliterated into ਇ [ɪ]. − If Hamza (Y) is followed by Pesh (E◌), then Hamza (Y) and Pesh (E◌) will be transliterated into ਉ [ʊ]. In all other cases, Hamza (Y) will be transliterated into ਇ [ɪ]."]},{"title":"5 PMT System 5.1 System Architecture","paragraphs":["The architecture of PMT system and its functionality are described in this section. The system architecture of Punjabi Machine Transliteration System is shown in figure 1.","Unicode encoded Shahmukhi text input is received by the Input Text Parser that parses it into Shahmukhi words by using simple parsing techniques. These words are called Shahmukhi Tokens. Then these tokens are given to the Transliteration Component. This component gives each token to the PMT Token Converter that converts a Shahmukhi Token into a Gurmukhi Token by using the PMT Rules Manager, which consists of character mappings and dependency rules. The PMT Token Converter then gives the Gurmukhi Token back to the Transliteration Component. When all Shahmukhi Tokens are converted into Gurmukhi Tokens, then all Gurmukhi Tokens are passed to the Output Text Generator that generates the output Unicode encoded Gurmukhi text. The main PMT process is done by the PMT Token Converter and the PMT Rules Manager. Figure 1: Architecture of PMT System","PMT system is a rule based transliteration system and is very robust. It is fast and accurate in its working. It can be used in domains involving Information Communication Technology (web, WAP, instant messaging, etc.). 5.2 PMT Process The PMT Process is implemented in the PMT Token Converter and the PMT Rules Manager. For PMT, each Shahmukhi Token is parsed into its constituent characters and the character dependencies are determined on the basis of the occurrence and the contextual placement of the character in the token. In each Shahmukhi Token, there are some characters that bear dependencies and some characters are independent of such contextual dependencies for transliteration. If the character under consideration bears a dependency, then it is resolved and transliterated with the help of dependency rules.

This is done through mapping a character of the Shahmukhi token to its equivalent Gurmukhi character with the help of character mapping tables 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7, which-ever is applicable. In this way, a Shahmukhi Token is transliterated into its equivalent Gurmukhi Token.","Consider some input Shahmukhi text S. First it is parsed into Shahmukhi Tokens (S 1, S2 ... S N).

To consider the historical aspects, two manuscripts, poetry by Maqbal (Maqbal) and Heer by Waris Shah (Waris, 1766) were selected. Geographically Punjab is divided into four parts eastern Punjab (Indian Punjab), central Punjab, southern Punjab and northern Punjab. All these geographical regions represent the major dialects of Punjabi. Hayms of Baba Nanak (eastern Punjab), Heer by Waris Shah (central Punjab), Hayms by Khawaja Farid (southern Punjab) and Saif-ul-Malooq by Mian Muhammad Bakhsh (northern Punjab) were selected for the evaluation of PMT system. All the above selected texts are categorized as classical literature of Punjabi. In modern literature, poetry and short stories of different poets and writers were selected from some issues of Puncham (monthly Punjabi magazine since 1985) and other published books. All of these selected texts were then compiled into Unicode encoded text as none of them were available in this form before.","The main task after the compilation of all the selected texts into Unicode encoded texts is to put all necessary diacritical marks in the text. This is done with help of dictionaries. The accuracy of the PMT system depends upon the necessary diacritical marks. Absence of the necessary diacritical marks affects the accuracy greatly. 6.2 Results After the compilation of selected input texts, they are transliterated into Gurmukhi texts by using the PMT system.
