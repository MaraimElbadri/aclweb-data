CRFs are basically defined as a discriminative model of Markov random fields conditioned on inputs (observations) x. Unlike generative models, CRFs model only the output y’s distribution over x. This allows CRFs to use fle xible features such as complicated functions of multiple observations. The modeling power of CRFs has been of great benefit in several applications, such as shallow pars-ing (Sha and Pereira, 2003) and information extraction (McCallum and Li, 2003).","Since the introduction of CRFs, intensive research has been undertaken to boost their effectiveness. The firstapproach to estimating CRF parameters is the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion over conditional probability p(yjx) itself (Lafferty et al., 2001). The ML criterion, however, is prone to over-fitting the training data, especially since CRFs are often trained with a very large number of correlated features. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion over parameters, λ, given x and y is the natural choice for reducing over-fitting (Sha and Pereira, 2003). Moreover, the Bayes approach, which optimizes both MAP and the prior distribution of the parameters, has also been proposed (Qi et al., 2005). Furthermore, large margin criteria have been employed to optimize the model parameters (Taskar et al., 2004; Tsochantaridis et al., 2005).","These training criteria have yielded excellent results for various tasks. However, real world tasks are evaluated by task-specific evaluation measures, including non-linear measures such as F-score, while all of the above criteria achieve optimization based on the linear combination of average accuracies, or error rates, rather than a given task-specificevaluation measure. For example, sequential segmentation tasks (SSTs), such as text chunking and named entity recognition, are generally evaluated with the segmentation F-score. This inconsistency between the objective function during training and the task evaluation measure might produce a suboptimal result.","In fact, to overcome this inconsistency, an SVM-based multivariate optimization method has recently been proposed (Joachims, 2005). More-over, an F-score optimization method for logistic regression has also been proposed (Jansche, 2005). In the same spirit as the above studies, we firstpropose a generalization framework for CRF training that allows us to optimize directly not only the error rate, but also any evaluation measure. In other words, our framework can incorporate any evaluation measure of interest into the loss function and then optimize this loss function as the training objective function. Our proposed framework is fundamentally derived from an ap-proach to (smoothed) error rate minimization well 217 known in the speech and pattern recognition community, namely the Minimum Classification Error (MCE) framework (Juang and Katagiri, 1992). The framework of MCE criterion training supports the theoretical background of our method. The ap-proach proposed here subsumes the conventional ML/MAP criteria training of CRFs, as described in the following.","After describing the new framework, as an example of optimizing multivariate evaluation measures, we focus on SSTs and introduce a segmentation F-score loss function for CRFs."]},{"title":"2 CRFs and Training Criteria","paragraphs":["Given an input (observation) x2 X and parameter vector λ = fλ1, . . . , λM g, CRFs define the conditional probability p(yjx) of a particular output y 2 Y as being proportional to a product of potential functions on the cliques of a graph, which represents the interdependency of y and x.

The MCE criterion minimizes an empirical loss corresponding to a smooth approximation of the classificationerror. This MCE loss is itself defined in terms of a misclassification measure derived from the discriminant functions of a given task. Via the smoothing parameters, the MCE loss function can be made arbitrarily close to the binary classificationerror. An important property of this framework is that it makes it 218 possible in principle to achieve the optimal Bayes error even under incorrect modeling assumptions. It is easy to extend the MCE framework to use evaluation measures other than the classification error, namely the linear combination of error rates. Thus, it is possible to optimize directly a variety of (smoothed) evaluation measures. This is the ap-proach proposed in this article.","We first introduce a framework for MCE criterion training, focusing only on error rate optimization. Sec. 4 then describes an example of minimizing a different multivariate evaluation measure using MCE criterion training. 3.1 Brief Overview of MCE Let x 2 X be an input, and y 2 Y be an output. The Bayes decision rule decides the most probable output ŷ for x, by using the maximum a posteriori probability, ŷ = arg maxy∈Y p(yjx; λ). In general, p(yjx; λ) can be replaced by a more general discriminant function, that is,","ŷ = arg max y∈Y g(y, x, ). (4)","Using the discriminant functions for the possi-","ble output of the task, the misclassificationmea-","sure d() is definedas follows: d(y∗",",x, ) = −g(y∗",",x, ) + max","y∈Y\\y∗g(y, x, ). (5) where y∗","is the correct output for x. Here it can be noted that, for a given x, d() 0 indicates misclassification. By using d(), the minimization of the error rate can be rewritten as the minimization of the sum of 0-1 (step) losses of the given training data. That is, arg minλ Lλ where Lλ=∑ k","δ(d(y∗k , xk",", )). (6) δ(r) is a step function returning 0 if r<0 and 1 otherwise. That is, δ is 0 if the value of the discriminant function of the correct output g(y∗k",", xk",", λ) is greater than that of the maximum incorrect output g(yk",", xk",", λ), and δ is 1 otherwise.","Eq. 5 is not an appropriate function for optimization since it is a discontinuous function w.r.t. the parameters λ. One choice of continuous misclassification measure consists of substituting ‘max’ with ‘soft-max’, maxk rk log","∑ k exp(rk). As a result","d(y∗ , x, ) = −g∗","+log [ A ∑ y∈Y\\y∗exp(ψg) ] 1 ψ , (7) where g∗","= g(y∗",", x, λ), g = g(y, x, λ), and A =","1 |Y|−1 . ψ is a positive constant that represents Lψ- norm. When ψ approaches 1, Eq. 7 converges to Eq. 5. Note that we can design any misclassification measure, including non-linear measures for d(). Some examples are shown in the Appendices.","Of even greater concern is the fact that the step function δ is discontinuous; minimization of Eq. 6 is therefore NP-complete. In the MCE formalism, δ() is replaced with an approximated 0-1 loss function, l(), which we refer to as a smoothing function. A typical choice for l() is the sigmoid function, lsig","(), which is differentiable and provides a good approximation of the 0-1 loss when the hyper-parameter α is large (see Eq. 8). Another choice is the (regularized) logistic function, llog","(), that gives the upper bound of the 0-1 loss. Logistic loss is used as a conventional CRF loss function and provides convexity while the sigmoid function does not. These two smoothing functions can be written as follows:","lsig = (1 + exp(−α · d(y∗",", x, ) − β))−1","llog = α−1","· log(1 + exp(α · d(y∗",", x, ) + β)), (8) where α and β are the hyper-parameters of the training.","We can introduce a regularization term to reduce over-fitting,which is derived using the same sense as in MAP, Eq. 2. Finally, the objective function of the MCE criterion with the regularization term can be rewritten in the following form: LMCE λ = Fl,d,g,λ [","{(xk",", y∗k",")}N","k=1 ] + || ||φ φC . (9) Then, the objective function of the MCE criterion that minimizes the error rate is Eq. 9 and FMCE l,d,g,λ = 1 N N ∑ k=1","l(d(y∗k , xk",", )) (10) is substituted for Fl,d,g,λ. Since N is constant, we can eliminate the term 1/N in actual use. 3.2 Formalization We simply substitute the discriminant function of the CRFs into that of the MCE criterion: g(y, x, ) = log p(y|x; ) ∝ · F (y, x) (11)","Basically, CRF training with the MCE criterion optimizes Eq. 9 with Eq. 11 after the selection of an appropriate misclassificationmeasure, d(), and 219 smoothing function, l(). Although there is no restriction on the choice of d() and l(), in this work we select sigmoid or logistic functions for l() and Eq. 7 for d().","The gradient of the loss function Eq. 9 can be decomposed by the following chain rule:","∇LMCE λ = ∂F() ∂l() · ∂l() ∂d() · ∂d() ∂ +","||λ||φ−1 C . The derivatives of l() w.r.t. d() given in Eq.","8 are written as: ∂lsig","/∂d = α lsig","(1 lsig",") and","∂llog /∂d = lsig",". The derivative of d() of Eq. 7 w.r.t. parameters","λ is written in this form: ∂d() ∂ = −","Zλ(x, ψ)","Zλ(x, ψ)−exp(ψg∗",") ·F (y∗",", x) + ∑ y∈Y [ exp(ψg)","Zλ(x, ψ)−exp(ψg∗",") ·F (y, x) ] (12) where g = λ F (y, x), g∗","= λ F (y∗",", x), and Zλ(x, ψ)=∑","y∈Y exp(ψg).","Note that we can obtain exactly the same loss function as ML/MAP with appropriate choices of F (), l() and d(). The details are provided in the Appendices. Therefore, ML/MAP can be seen as one special case of the framework proposed here. In other words, our method provides a generalized framework of CRF training. 3.3 Optimization Procedure With linear chain CRFs, we can calculate the objective function, Eq. 9 combined with Eq. 10, and the gradient, Eq. 12, by using the variant of the forward-backward and Viterbi algorithm described in (Sha and Pereira, 2003). Moreover, for the parameter optimization process, we can simply exploit gradient descent or quasi-Newton methods such as L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) as well as ML/MAP optimization.","If we select ψ = 1 for Eq. 7, we only need to evaluate the correct and the maximum incorrect output. As we know, the maximum output can be efficiently calculated with the Viterbi algorithm, which is the same as calculating Eq. 1. Therefore, we can find the maximum incorrect output by using the A* algorithm (Hart et al., 1968), if the maximum output is the correct output, and by using the Viterbi algorithm otherwise. It may be feared that since the objective function is not differentiable everywhere for ψ = 1, problems for optimization would occur. However, it has been shown (Le Roux and McDermott, 2005) that even simple gradient-based (first-order) optimization methods such as GPD and (approximated) second-order methods such as QuickProp (Fahlman, 1988) and BFGS-based methods have yielded good experimental optimization results."]},{"title":"4 Multivariate Evaluation Measures","paragraphs":["Thus far, we have discussed the error rate version of MCE. Unlike ML/MAP, the framework of MCE criterion training allows the embedding of not only a linear combination of error rates, but also any evaluation measure, including non-linear measures.","Several non-linear objective functions, such as F-score for text classification (Gao et al., 2003), and BLEU-score and some other evaluation measures for statistical machine translation (Och, 2003), have been introduced with reference to the framework of MCE criterion training. 4.1 Sequential Segmentation Tasks (SSTs) Hereafter, we focus solely on CRFs in sequences, namely the linear chain CRF. We assume that x and y have the same length: x=(x1, . . . , xn) and y=(y1, . . . , yn). In a linear chain CRF, yi depends only on yi−1.","Sequential segmentation tasks (SSTs), such as text chunking (Chunking) and named entity recognition (NER), which constitute the shared tasks of the Conference of Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) 2000, 2002 and 2003, are typical CRF applications. These tasks require the extrac-tion of pre-defined segments, referred to as target segments, from given texts. Fig. 1 shows typical examples of SSTs. These tasks are generally treated as sequential labeling problems incorporating the IOB tagging scheme (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995). The IOB tagging scheme, where we only consider the IOB2 scheme, is also shown in Fig. 1. B-X, I-X and O indicate that the word in question is the beginning of the tag ‘X’, inside the tag ‘X’, and outside any target segment, respectively. Therefore, a segment is defined as a sequence of a few outputs. 4.2 Segmentation F-score Loss for SSTs The standard evaluation measure of SSTs is the segmentation F-score (Sang and Buchholz, 2000): Fγ = (γ2","+ 1) · T P","γ2","· F N + F P + (γ2","+ 1) · T P (13) 220 He reckons the current account deficit will narrow to only # 1.8 billion .NP VP NP VP PP NP B-NP B-VP B-NP I-NP I-NP I-NP B-VP I-VP B-PP B-NP I-NP I-NP I-NP O x: y: Seg.: United Nation official Ekeus Smith heads for Baghdad .

We need to define a segment-wise loss, in contrast to the standard CRF loss, which is sometimes referred to as an (entire) sequential loss (Kakade et al., 2002; Altun et al., 2003). First, we consider the point-wise decision w.r.t. Eq. 1, that is, ŷi = arg maxyi∈Y1 g(y, x, i, λ). The point-wise discriminant function can be written as follows:","g(y, x, i, ) = max","y′ ∈Y |y|[y","i] · F (y′",", x) (14) where Yj represents a set of all y whose length is j, and Y[yi] represents a set of all y that contain yi in the i’th position. Note that the same output ŷ can be obtained with Eqs. 1 and 14, that is, ŷ = (ŷ1, . . . , ŷn). This point-wise discriminant function is different from that described in (Kakade et al., 2002; Altun et al., 2003), which is calculated based on marginals.","Let ysj be an output sequence corresponding to the j-th segment of y, where sj represents a sequence of indices of y, that is, sj = (sj,1, . . . , sj,|sj|). An example of the Chunking data shown in Fig. 1, ys4 is (B-VP, I-VP) where s4 = (7, 8). Let Y[ysj ] be a set of all outputs whose positions from sj,1 to sj,|sj| are ysj = (ysj,1 , . . . , ysj,|s","j| ). Then, we can define a segment-wise discriminant function w.r.t. Eq. 1. That is,","g(y, x, sj, ) = max y′ ∈Y","|y|[ys j ]","· F (y′ , x). (15) Note again that the same output ŷ can be obtained using Eqs. 1 and 15, as with the piece-wise discriminant function described above. This property is needed for evaluating segments since we do not know the correct segments of the test data; we can maintain consistency even if we use Eq. 1 for test-ing and Eq. 15 for training. Moreover, Eq. 15 obviously reduces to Eq. 14 if the length of all segments is 1. Then, the segment-wise misclassification measure d(y∗",", x, s","j, λ) can be obtained simply by replacing the discriminant function of the entire sequence g(y, x, λ) with that of segment-wise g(y, x, sj, λ) in Eq. 7. Let s∗k","be a segment sequence corresponding to the correct output y∗k","for a given xk",", and S(xk",") be all possible segments for a given xk",". Then, approximated evaluation functions of T P , F P and F N can be definedas follows: T Pl = ∑ k ∑ s∗ j ∈s∗k [","1−l(d(y∗k , xk , s∗","j , )) ]","·δ(s∗ j ) F Pl = ∑ k ∑","s′","j∈S(xk",")\\s∗kl(d(y∗k , xk",", s′","j, ))·δ(s′","j) F Nl = ∑ k ∑ s∗ j ∈s∗k","l(d(y∗k",", xk , s∗","j , ))·δ(s∗","j ) where δ(sj) returns 1 if segment sj is a target segment, and returns 0 otherwise. For the NER data shown in Fig. 1, ‘ORG’, ‘PER’ and ‘LOC’ are the target segments, while segments that are labeled ‘O’ in y are not. Since T Pl should not have a value of less than zero, we select sigmoid loss as the smoothing function l().","The second summation of T Pl and F Nl performs a summation over correct segments s∗",". In contrast, the second summation in F Pl takes all possible segments into account, but excludes the correct segments s∗",". Although an efficientway to evaluate all possible segments has been proposed in the context of semi-Markov CRFs (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004), we introduce a simple alternative method. If we select ψ = 1 for d() in Eq. 7, we only need to evaluate the segments corresponding to the maximum incorrect output ỹ to calculate F Pl. That is, s′","j 2 S(xk",")ns∗k","can be reduced to s′","j 2 s̃k",", where s̃k","represents segments corresponding to the maximum incorrect output ỹ. In practice, this reduces the calculation cost and so we used this method for our experiments described in the next section.","Maximizing the segmentation Fγ-score, Eq. 13, 221","is equivalent to minimizing γ2 ·F N+F P (γ2 +1)·T P , since Eq.","13 can also be written as Fγ = 1 1+ γ2","·FN+FP","(γ2","+1)·TP . Thus, an objective function closely reflecting the segmentation Fγ-score based on the MCE criterion can be written as Eq. 9 while replacing Fl,d,g,λ with: FMCE-F l,d,g,λ = γ2 · F Nl + F Pl (γ2","+ 1) · T Pl .

The same numerical optimization methods described in Sec. 3.3 can be employed for this optimization."]},{"title":"5 Experiments","paragraphs":["We used the same Chunking and ‘English’ NER task data used for the shared tasks of CoNLL-2000 (Sang and Buchholz, 2000) and CoNLL-2003 (Sang and De Meulder, 2003), respectively.","Chunking data was obtained from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus: sections 15-18 as training data (8,936 sentences and 211,727 tokens), and section 20 as test data (2,012 sentences and 47,377 tokens), with 11 different chunk-tags, such as NP and VP plus the ‘O’ tag, which represents the outside of any target chunk (segment).","The English NER data was taken from the Reuters Corpus21",".

We expanded the basic features by using bigram combinations of the same types of features, such as words and part-of-speech tags, within window size 5.","In contrast to the above, we used the original feature set for NER.

However, we proposed a general framework for designing these loss function that included non-linear loss functions, which has not been considered in previous work.","With Chunking, (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) reported the best F-score of 93.91 with the vot-ing of several models trained by Support Vector Machine in the same experimental settings and with the same feature set. MCE-F with the MAP parameter initialization achieved an F-score of 94.03, which surpasses the above result without manual parameter tuning.","With NER, we cannot make a direct comparison with previous work in the same experimental settings because of the different feature set, as described in Sec. 5.2. However, MCE-F showed the better performance of 85.29 compared with (McCallum and Li, 2003) of 84.04, which used the MAP training of CRFs with a feature selection architecture, yielding similar results to the MAP results described here. 223"]},{"title":"7 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We proposed a framework for training CRFs based on optimization criteria directly related to target multivariate evaluation measures. We first provided a general framework of CRF training based on MCE criterion. Then, specifically focusing on SSTs, we introduced an approximate segmentation F-score objective function. Experimental results showed that eliminating the inconsistency between the task evaluation measure and the objective function used during training improves the overall performance in the target task without any change in feature set or model."]},{"title":"Appendices Misclassificationmeasures","paragraphs":["Another type of misclassification measure using soft-max is (Katagiri et al., 1991):","d(y, x, ) = −g∗ + [ A ∑ y∈Y\\y∗ gψ ] 1 ψ .
