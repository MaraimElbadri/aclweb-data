Although templates are widely used in many practical systems (Seneff and Polifroni, 2000; Theune, 2003), we derive syntactic structures to represent the potential realizations, in order to allow aggregation, and other syntactic transformations of utterances, as well as context specific prosody assignment (Walker et al., 2003; Moore et al., 2004).","The method is outlined briefly in Fig. 1 and described below. It comprises the following steps: 1. Collect user reviews on the web to create a","population of utterances U . 2. To derive semantic representations R(U ): • Identify distinguished attributes and","construct a domain ontology; • Specify lexicalizations of attributes; • Scrape webpages’ structured data for","named-entities; • Tag named-entities.","3.

Add mappings (U , R, S) to dictionary. 2.1 Creating the corpus We created a corpus of restaurant reviews by scraping 3,004 user reviews of 1,810 restaurants posted at we8there.com (http://www.we8there.com/), where each individual review includes a 1-to-5 Likert-scale rating of different restaurant attributes. The corpus consists of 18,466 sentences. 2.2 Deriving semantic representations The distinguished attributes are extracted from the webpages for each restaurant entity. They include attributes that the users are asked to rate, i.e. food, service, atmosphere, value,andover-all, which have scalar values. In addition, other attributes are extracted from the webpage, such as the name, foodtype and location of the restaurant, which have categorical values. The name attribute is assumed to correspond to the restaurant entity. Given the distinguished attributes, a Dist. Attr.

Thus, the domain ontology consists of the relations:","","  RESTAURANT has foodquality RESTAURANT has servicequality RESTAURANT has valuequality RESTAURANT has atmospherequality RESTAURANT has overallquality RESTAURANT has foodtype RESTAURANT has location","We assume that, although users may discuss other attributes of the entity, at least some of the utterances in the reviews realize the relations specified in the ontology. Our problem then is to identify these utterances. We test the hypothesis that, if an utterance U contains named-entities corresponding to the distinguished attributes, that R for that utterance includes the relation concerning that attribute in the domain ontology.","We define named-entities for lexicalizations of the distinguished attributes, starting with the seed word for that attribute on the webpage (Table 1).1 For named-entity recognition, we use GATE (Cunningham et al., 2002), augmented with named-entity lists for locations, food types, restaurant names, and food subtypes (e.g. pizza), scraped from the we8there webpages.","We also hypothesize that the rating given for the distinguished attribute specifies the scalar value of the relation. For example, a sentence containing food or meal is assumed to realize the relation ‘RESTAURANT has foodquality.’,andthe value of the foodquality attribute is assumed to be the value specified in the user rating for that attribute, e.g. ‘RESTAURANT has foodquality = 5’ in Fig. 1. Similarly, the other relations in Fig. 1 are assumed to be realized by the utterance “The best Spanish food in New York” because it contains 1","In future, we will investigate other techniques for bootstrapping these lexicalizations from the seed word on the webpage. 266 filter filtered retained No Relations Filter 7,947 10,519 Other Relations Filter 5,351 5,168 Contextual Filter 2,973 2,195 Unknown Words Filter 1,467 728 Parsing Filter 216 512 Table 2: Filtering statistics: the number of sentences filtered and retained by each filter. one FOODTYPE named-entity and one LOCATION named-entity. Values of categorical attributes are replaced by variables representing their type before the learned mappings are added to the dictionary, as shown in Fig. 1. 2.3 Parsing and DSyntS conversion We adopt Deep Syntactic Structures (DSyntSs) as a format for syntactic structures because they can be realized by the fast portable realizer RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997). Since DSyntSs are a type of dependency structure, we first process the sentences with Minipar (Lin, 1998), and then convert Minipar’s representation into DSyntS. Since user reviews are different from the newspaper articles on which Minipar was trained, the output of Minipar can be inaccurate, leading to failure in conversion. We check whether conversion is successful in the filtering stage. 2.4 Filtering The goal of filtering is to identify U that realize the distinguished attributes and to guarantee high precision for the learned mappings. Recall is less important since systems need to convey requested information as accurately as possible. Our procedure for deriving semantic representations is based on the hypothesis that if U contains named-entities that realize the distinguished attributes, that R will include the relevant relation in the domain ontology. We also assume that if U contains named-entities that are not covered by the domain ontology, or words indicating that the meaning of U depends on the surrounding context, that R will not completely characterizes the meaning of U ,andso U should be eliminated. We also require an accurate S for U . Therefore, the filters described below eliminate U that (1) realize semantic relations not in the ontology; (2) contain words indicating that its meaning depends on the context; (3) contain unknown words; or (4) cannot be parsed accurately.","No Relations Filter: The sentence does not contain any named-entities for the distinguished attributes.","Other Relations Filter: The sentence contains named-entities for food subtypes, person","Rating Dist.Attr. 1234 5Total food 5 8 6 18 57 94 service 15 3 6 17 56 97 atmosphere 033831 45 value 001812 21 overall 3 2 5 15 45 70 Total 23 15 21 64 201 327 Table 3: Domain coverage of single scalar-valued relation mappings. names, country names, dates (e.g., today, to-morrow, Aug. 26th) or prices (e.g., 12 dollars), or POS tag CD for numerals. These in-dicate relations not in the ontology.","Contextual Filter: The sentence contains indexicals such as I, you, that or cohesive markers of rhetorical relations that connect it to some part of the preceding text, which means that the sentence cannot be interpreted out of context. These include discourse markers, such as list item markers with LS as the POS tag, that signal the organization structure of the text (Hirschberg and Litman, 1987), as well as discourse connectives that signal semantic and pragmatic relations of the sentence with other parts of the text (Knott, 1996), such as coordinating conjunctions at the beginning of the utterance like and and but etc., and conjunct adverbs such as however, also, then.","Unknown Words Filter: The sentence contains words not in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) (which includes typographical errors), or POS tags contain NN (Noun), which may in-dicate an unknown named-entity, or the sentence has more than a fixed length of words,2 indicating that its meaning may not be estimated solely by named entities.","Parsing Filter: The sentence fails the parsing to DSyntS conversion. Failures are automatically detected by comparing the original sentence with the one realized by RealPro taking the converted DSyntS as an input. We apply the filters, in a cascading manner, to the 18,466 sentences with semantic representations. As a result, we obtain 512 (2.8%) mappings of (U , R, S). After removing 61 duplicates, 451 distinct (2.4%) mappings remain.

Table 3 shows the distribution of the 327 mappings realizing a single scalar-valued relation, categorized by the associated rating score.3","For example, there are 57 mappings with R of ‘RESTAURANT has foodquality=5,’ and a large number of mappings for both the foodquality and servicequality relations. Although we could not obtain mappings for some relations such as price={1,2}, coverage for expressing a single relation is fairly complete.","There are also mappings that express several relations. Table 4 shows the counts of mappings for multi-relation mappings, with those containing a food or service relation occurring more frequently as in the single scalar-valued relation mappings. We found only 21 combinations of relations, which is surprising given the large potential number of combinations (There are 50 combinations if we treat relations with different scalar values differently). We also find that most of the mappings have two or three relations, perhaps suggesting that system utterances should not express too many relations in a single sentence. 3.2 Linguistic Variation We also wish to assess whether the linguistic variation of the learned mappings was greater than what we could easily have generated with a hand-crafted dictionary, or a hand-crafted dictionary augmented with aggregation operators, as in 3 There are two other single-relation but not scalar-valued","mappings that concern LOCATION in our mappings. (Walker et al., 2003). Thus, we first categorized the mappings by the patterns of the DSyntSs. Table 5 shows the most common syntactic patterns (more than 10 occurrences), indicating that 30% of the learned patterns consist of the simple form “X is ADJ”whereADJ is an adjective, or “X is RB ADJ,” where RB is a degree modifier. Furthermore, up to 55% of the learned mappings could be generated from these basic patterns by the application of a combination operator that coordinates multiple adjectives, or coordinates predications over distinct attributes. However, there are 137 syntactic patterns in all, 97 with unique syntactic structures and 21 with two occurrences, accounting for 45% of the learned mappings. Table 6 shows examples of learned mappings with distinct syntactic structures. It would be surprising to see this type of variety in a hand-crafted generation dictionary. In addition, the learned mappings contain 275 distinct lexemes, with a minimum of 2, maximum of 15, and mean of 4.63 lexemes per DSyntS, indicating that the method extracts a wide variety of expressions of varying lengths.","Another interesting aspect of the learned mappings is the wide variety of adjectival phrases (APs)inthecommonpatterns. Tables7and8 show the APs in single scalar-valued relation mappings for food and service categorized by the associated ratings. Tables for atmosphere, value and overall can be found in the Appendix. Moreover, the meanings for some of the learned APs are very specific to the particular attribute, e.g. cold and burnt associated with foodquality of 1, attentive and prompt for servicequality of 5, silly and inattentive for servicequality of 1. and mellow for atmosphere of 5. In addition, our method places the adjectival phrases (APs) in the common patterns on a more fine-grained scale of 1 to 5, similar to the strength classifications in (Wilson et al., 2004), in contrast to other automatic methods that classify expressions into a binary positive or negative polarity (e.g. (Turney, 2002)). 3.3 Generativity Our motivation for deriving syntactic representations for the learned expressions was the possibility of using an off-the-shelf sentence planner to derive new combinations of relations, and apply aggregation and other syntactic transformations. We examined how many of the learned DSyntSs can be combined with each other, by taking every pair of DSyntSs in the mappings and apply-ing the built-in merge operation in the SPaRKy generator (Walker et al., 2003). We found that only 306 combinations out of a potential 81,318 268 # syntactic pattern example utterance count ratio accum. 1 NN VB JJ The atmosphere is wonderful. 92 20.4% 20.4% 2 NN VB RB JJ The atmosphere was very nice. 52 11.5% 31.9% 3 JJ NN Bad service. 36 8.0% 39.9% 4 NN VB JJ CC JJ The food was flavorful but cold. 25 5.5% 45.5% 5 RB JJ NN Very trendy ambience. 22 4.9% 50.3% 6 NN VB JJ CC NN VB JJ The food is excellent and the atmosphere is great. 13 2.9% 53.2% 7 NN CC NN VB JJ The food and service were fantastic. 10 2.2% 55.4% Table 5: Common syntactic patterns of DSyntSs, flattened to a POS sequence for readability.

Table 6: Acquired generation patterns (with shorthand for relations in square brackets) whose syntactic patterns occurred only once. combinations (0.37%) were successful. This is because the merge operation in SPaRKy requires that the subjects and the verbs of the two DSyntSs are identical, e.g. the subject is RESTAURANT and verb is has, whereas the learned DSyntSs often place the attribute in subject position as a definite noun phrase. However, the learned DSyntS can be incorporated into SPaRKy using the semantic representations to substitute learned DSyntSs into nodes in the sentence plan tree. Figure 2 shows some example utterances generated by SPaRKy with its original dictionary and example utterances when the learned mappings are incorporated. The resulting utterances seem more natural and colloquial; we examine whether this is true in the next section."]},{"title":"4 Subjective Evaluation","paragraphs":["We evaluate the obtained mappings in two respects: the consistency between the automatically derived semantic representation and the realiza-","food=1 awful, bad, burnt, cold, very ordinary","food=2 acceptable, bad, flavored, not enough, very bland, very good","food=3 adequate, bland and mediocre, flavorful but cold, pretty good, rather bland, very good","food=4 absolutely wonderful, awesome, decent, excellent, good, good and generous, great, outstanding, rather good, really good, traditional, very fresh and tasty, very good, very very good","food=5 absolutely delicious, absolutely fantastic, absolutely great, absolutely terrific, ample, well seasoned and hot, awesome, best, delectable and plentiful, delicious, delicious but simple, excellent, exquisite, fabulous, fancy but tasty, fantastic, fresh, good, great, hot, incredible, just fantastic, large and satisfying, outstanding, plentiful and outstanding, plentiful and tasty, quick and hot, simply great, so delicious, so very tasty, superb, terrific, tremendous, very good, wonderful Table 7: Adjectival phrases (APs) in single scalar-valued relation mappings for foodquality. tion, and the naturalness of the realization.","For comparison, we used a baseline of hand-crafted mappings from (Walker et al., 2003) except that we changed the word decor to atmosphere and added five mappings for overall.

RESTAURANT is filled with the name of a restaurant at runtime. For example, ‘RESTAURANT has foodquality=1’ is realized as “RESTAURANT has mediocre food quality.” The location and food type relations are mapped to “RESTAURANT is located in LOCATION” and “RESTAURANT is a FOODTYPE restaurant.”","The learned mappings include 23 distinct semantic representations for a single-relation (22 for scalar-valued relations and one for location) and 50 for multi-relations. Therefore, using the hand-crafted mappings, we first created 23 utterances for the single-relations.

Only 14 of the learned utterances (shown in Tab. 10) have a mean consistency score lower than 3, which indicates that, by and large, the human judges felt that the inferred semantic representations were consistent with the meaning of the learned expressions.

However, these studies find a set of sentences with the same meaning, but do not associate a specific meaning with the sentences.

For example, Hu and Liu (2005) use reviews to find adjectives to describe products, and Popescu and Etzioni (2005) automatically find features of a product together with the polarity of adjectives used to describe them. They both aim at summarizing reviews so that users can make decisions easily. Our method is also capable of finding polarities of modifying expressions including adjectives, but on a more fine-grained scale of 1 to 5. However, it might be possible to use their approach to create rating information for raw review texts as in (Pang and Lee, 2005), so that we can create mappings from reviews without ratings."]},{"title":"6 Summary and Future Work","paragraphs":["We proposed automatically obtaining mappings between semantic representations and realizations from reviews with individual ratings. The results show that: (1) the learned mappings provide good coverage of the domain ontology and exhibit good linguistic variation; (2) the consistency between the semantic representations and realizations is high; and (3) the naturalness of the realizations are significantly higher than the baseline.","There are also limitations in our method. Even though consistency is rated highly by human subjects, this may actually be a judgement of whether the polarity of the learned mapping is correctly placed on the 1 to 5 rating scale. Thus, alternate ways of expressing, for example foodquality=5, shown in Table 7, cannot be guaranteed to be synonymous, which may be required for use in spoken language generation. Rather, an examina-tion of the adjectival phrases in Table 7 shows that different aspects of the food are discussed. For example ample and plentiful refer to the portion size, fancy may refer to the presentation, and delicious describes the flavors. This suggests that perhaps the ontology would benefit from representing these sub-attributes of the food attribute, and sub-attributes in general. Another problem with consistency is that the same AP, e.g. very good in Table 7 may appear with multiple ratings. For example, very good is used for every foodquality rating from 2 to 5. Thus some further automatic or by-hand analysis is required to refine what is learned before actual use in spoken language generation. Still, our method could reduce the amount of time a system designer spends developing the spoken language generator, and increase the naturalness of spoken language generation.","Another issue is that the recall appears to be quite low given that all of the sentences concern the same domain: only 2.4% of the sentences could be used to create the mappings. One way to increase recall might be to automatically aug-ment the list of distinguished attribute lexicalizations, using WordNet or work on automatic identification of synonyms, such as (Lin and Pantel, 2001). However, the method here has high precision, and automatic techniques may introduce noise. A related issue is that the filters are in some cases too strict. For example the contextual filter is based on POS-tags, so that sentences that do not require the prior context for their interpreta-tion are eliminated, such as sentences containing subordinating conjunctions like because, when, if, whose arguments are both given in the same sentence (Prasad et al., 2005). In addition, recall is affected by the domain ontology, and the automatically constructed domain ontology from the review webpages may not cover all of the domain. In some review domains, the attributes that get individual ratings are a limited subset of the domain ontology. Techniques for automatic feature identification (Hu and Liu, 2005; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) could possibly help here, although these techniques currently have the limitation that they do not automatically identify different lexicalizations of the same feature.","A different type of limitation is that dialogue systems need to generate utterances for information gathering whereas the mappings we obtained 271 can only be used for information presentation. Thus these would have to be constructed by hand, as in current practice, or perhaps other types of corpora or resources could be utilized. In addi-tion, the utility of syntactic structures in the mappings should be further examined, especially given the failures in DSyntS conversion. An alternative would be to leave some sentences unparsed and use them as templates with hybrid generation techniques (White and Caldwell, 1998). Finally, while we believe that this technique will apply across domains, it would be useful to test it on domains such as movie reviews or product reviews, which have more complex domain ontologies."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank the anonymous reviewers for their help-ful comments.
