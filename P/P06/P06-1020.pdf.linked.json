Such sublexical units make it possible to expose the internal structure of words with multiple derivations to the grammar rules in a uniform manner. This in turn leads to more succinct and manageable rules. Further, the semantics of the derivations can also be systematically reflected in a compositional way by constructing PRED values on the fly. We illustrate how we use sublexical units for handling simple productive derivational morphology and more interesting cases such as causativization, etc., which change verb valency. Our priority is to handle several linguistic phenomena in order to observe the effects of our approach on both the c-structure and the f-structure representation, and grammar writing, leaving the coverage and evaluation issues aside for the moment."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["This paper presents highlights of a large scale lexical functional grammar for Turkish that is being developed in the context of the ParGram project1 In order to incorporate in a manageable way, the complex morphology and the syntactic relations mediated by morphological units, and to handle lexical representations of very productive derivations, we have opted to develop the grammar using sublexical units called inflectional groups.","Inflectional groups (IGs hereafter) represent the inflectional properties of segments of a complex","1","http://www2.parc.com/istl/groups/nltt/ pargram/ word structure separated by derivational boundaries. An IG is typically larger than a morpheme but smaller than a word (except when the word has no derivational morphology in which case the IG corresponds to the word). It turns out that it is the IGs that actually define syntactic relations between words. A grammar for Turkish that is based on words as units would have to refer to information encoded at arbitrary positions in words, making the task of the grammar writer much harder. On the other hand, treating morphemes as units in the grammar level implies that the grammar will have to know about morphotactics making either the morphological analyzer redundant, or repeat-ing the information in the morphological analyzer at the grammar level which is not very desirable. IGs bring a certain form of normalization to the lexical representation of a language like Turkish, so that units in which the grammar rules refer to are simple enough to allow easy access to the information encoded in complex word structures.","That IGs delineate productive derivational processes in words necessitates a mechanism that reflects the effect of the derivations to semantic representations and valency changes. For instance, English LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) represents derivations as a part of the lexicon; both happy and happiness are separately lexicalized. Lexicalized representations of adjectives such as easy and easier are related, so that both lexicalized and phrasal comparatives would have the same feature structure; easier would have the feature structure (1)       PRED ‘easy’ ADJUNCT  PRED ‘more’  DEG-DIM pos DEGREE comparative      ","Encoding derivations in the lexicon could be applicable for languages with relatively unproductive derivational phenomena, but it certainly is not 153 possible to represent in the grammar lexicon,2","all derived forms as lexemes for an agglutinative language like Turkish. Thus one needs to incorporate such derivational processes in a principled way along with the computation of the effects on derivations on the representation of the semantic information.","Lexical functional grammar (LFG) (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) is a theory representing the syntax in two parallel levels: Constituent structures (c-structures) have the form of context-free phrase structure trees. Functional structures (f-structures) are sets of pairs of attributes and values; attributes may be features, such as tense and gender, or functions, such as subject and object. C-structures define the syntactic representation and f-structures define more semantic representation. Therefore c-structures are more language specific whereas f-structures of the same phrase for different languages are expected to be similar to each other.","The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related work both on Turkish, and on issues similar to those addressed in this paper. Section 3 motivates and presents IGs while Section 4 explains how they are employed in a LFG setting. Section 5 summarizes the architecture and the current status of the our system. Finally we give conclusions in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Güngördü and Oflazer (1995) describes a rather extensive grammar for Turkish using the LFG formalism. Although this grammar had a good coverage and handled phenomena such as free-constituent order, the underlying implementation was based on pseudo-unification. But most crucially, it employed a rather standard approach to represent the lexical units: words with multiple nested derivations were represented with complex nested feature structures where linguistically relevant information could be embedded at unpredictable depths which made access to them in rules extremely complex and unwieldy.","Bozsa̧hin (2002) employed morphemes overtly as lexical units in a CCG framework to account for a variety of linguistic phenomena in a prototype implementation. The drawback was that morphotactics was explicitly raised to the level of the sentence grammar, hence the categorial lexicon accounted for both constituent order and the morpheme order with no distinction. Oflazer’s dependency parser (2003) used IGs as units between which dependency relations were established. An-other parser based on IGs is Eryiğit and Oflazer’s","2","We use this term to distinguish the lexicon used by the morphological analyzer. (2006) statistical dependency parser for Turkish. Çakıcı (2005), used relations between IG-based representations encoded within the Turkish Treebank (Oflazer et al., 2003) to automatically induce a CCG grammar lexicon for Turkish.","In a more general setting, Butt and King (2005) have handled the morphological causative in Urdu as a separate node in c-structure rules using LFG’s restriction operator in semantic construction of causatives. Their approach is quite similar to ours yet differs in an important way: the rules explicitly use morphemes as constituents so it is not clear if this is just for this case, or all morphology is handled at the syntax level."]},{"title":"3 Inflectional Groups as Sublexical Units","paragraphs":["Turkish is an agglutinative language where a sequence of inflectional and derivational morphemes get affixed to a root (Oflazer, 1994). At the syntax level, the unmarked constituent order is SOV, but constituent order may vary freely as demanded by the discourse context. Essentially all constituent orders are possible, especially at the main sentence level, with very minimal formal constraints. In written text however, the unmarked order is dominant at both the main sentence and embedded clause level.","Turkish morphotactics is quite complicated: a given word form may involve multiple derivations and the number of word forms one can generate from a nominal or verbal root is theoretically infinite. Turkish words found in typical text average about 3-4 morphemes including the stem, with an average of about 1.23 derivations per word, but given that certain noninflecting function words such as conjuctions, determiners, etc. are rather frequent, this number is rather close to 2 for in-flecting word classes. Statistics from the Turkish Treebank indicate that for sentences ranging between 2 words to 40 words (with an average of about 8 words), the number of IGs range from 2 to 55 IGs (with an average of 10 IGs per sentence) (Eryiğit and Oflazer, 2006).","The morphological analysis of a word can be represented as a sequence of tags corresponding to the morphemes. In our morphological analyzer output, the tag D̂B denotes derivation boundaries that we also use to define IGs. If we represent the morphological information in Turkish in the following general form:","root+IG","","DB+IG","","DB+","","DB+IG",". then each IG","denotes the relevant sequence of inflectional features including the part-of-speech for the root (in IG",") and for any of the derived forms. A given word may have multiple such representations depending on any morphological ambiguity brought about by alternative segmentations of the 154 Figure 1: Modifier-head relations in the NP eski kitaplarımdaki hikayeler","word, and by ambiguous interpretations of mor-","phemes.

The second IG indicates a derivation into a verb whose semantics is “to acquire” the preceding noun. The third IG indicates that a causative verb (equivalent to “to punish” in English), is derived from the previous verb. The fourth IG indicates the derivation of a passive verb with positive polarity from the previous verb. Finally the last IG represents a derivation into future participle which will function as a modifier in the sentence.","The simple phrase eski kitaplarımdaki hikayeler (the stories in my old books) in Figure 1 will help clarify how IGs are involved in syntactic relations: Here, eski (old) modifies kitap (book) and not hikayeler (stories),4","and the locative phrase eski","3","The morphological features other than the obvious part-of-speech features are: +A3sg: 3sg number-person agreement, +Pnon: no possesive agreement, +Nom: Nominative case, +Acquire: acquire verb, +Caus: causative verb, +Pass: passive verb, +FutPart: Derived future participle, +Pos: Positive Polarity.","4","Though looking at just the last POS of the words one sees an +Adj +Adj +Noun sequence which may imply that both adjectives modify the noun hikayeler kitaplarımda (in my old books) modifies hikayeler with the help of derivational suffix -ki.

Within the tree representation, each IG corresponds to a separate node. Thus, the LFG grammar rules constructing the c-structures are coded using IGs as units of parsing. If an IG contains the root morpheme of a word, then the node corresponding to that IG is named as one of the syntactic category symbols. The rest of the IGs are given the node name DS (to indicate derivational suffix), no matter what the content of the IG is.","The semantic representation of derivational suffixes plays an important role in f-structure construction. In almost all cases, each derivation that is induced by an overt or a covert affix gets a OBJ feature which is then unified with the f-structure of the preceding stem already constructed, to obtain the feature structure of the derived form, with the PRED of the derived form being constructed on the fly. A PRED feature thus constructed however is not meant to necessarily have a precise lexical semantics. Most derivational suffixes have a consistent (lexical) semantics6",", but some don’t, that is, the precise additional lexical semantics that the derivational suffix brings in, depends on the stem it is affixed to. Nevertheless, we represent both cases in the same manner, leaving the determina-tion of the precise lexical semantics aside.","If we consider Figure 2 in terms of dependency relations, the adjective mavi (blue) modifies the noun renk (color) and then the derivational suffix -li (with) kicks in although the -li is attached to renk only. Therefore, the semantics of the phrase should be with(blue color), not blue with(color). With the approach we take, this difference can easily be represented in both the f-structure as in the leftmost branch in Example (5)","6","e.g., the “to acquire” example earlier and the c-structure as in the middle ADJUNCT f-structure in Example (6). Each DS in c-structure gives rise to an OBJject in c-structure. More precisely, a derived phrase is always represented as a binary tree where the right daughter is always a DS. In f-structure DS unifies with the mother f-structure and inserts PRED feature which subcategorizes for a OBJ. The left daughter of the binary tree is the original form of the phrase that is derived, and it unifies with the OBJ of the mother f-structure.

The final f-structure is for a noun phrase, which now is the object of the matrix verb, as shown in Example (9). Since the participle IG has the right set of syntactic features of a noun, no new rules are needed to incorporate the derived f-structure to the rest of the grammar, that is, the derived phrase can be used as if it is a simple NP within the rules. The same mechanism is used for all kinds of verbal derivations into infinitives, adverbial adjuncts, including those derivations encoded by lexical reduplications identified by multi-word construct processors.

Relative clauses in Turkish are gapped sentences which function as modifiers of nominal heads. Turkish relative clauses have been previously studied (Barker et al., 1990; Güngördü and Engdahl, 1998) and found to pose interesting issues for linguistic and computational modeling. Our aim here is not to address this problem in its generality but show with a simple example, how our treatment of IGs encoding derived forms handle the mechanics of generating f-structures for such cases.","Kaplan and Zaenen (1988) have suggested a general approach for handling long distance dependencies. They have extended the LFG notation and allowed regular expressions in place of simple attributes within f-structure constraints so that phenomena requiring infinite disjunctive enumeration can be described with a finite expression. We basically follow this approach and once we derive the participle phrase we unify it with the appropriate argument of the verb using rules based on functional uncertainty. Example (10) shows a relative clause where a participle form is used as a modifier of a head noun, adam in this case.","(10) Manavın Grocer-GEN kızın girl-GEN [] obj-gap aradığını call-PASTPART-ACC söylediği say-PASTPART adam man-NOM ‘The man the grocer said the girl called’","This time, the sentence is parsed with a gap with an appropriate functional uncertainty constraint, and when the participle IG is encountered the sentence f-structure is derived into an adjective and the gap in the derived form, the object here, is then unified with the head word as marked with co-indexation in Example (11).","The example sentence (10) includes Example (8) as a relative clause with the object extracted, hence the similarity in the f-structures can be observed easily.

The object of the causative (causee - that who is caused by the causer – the subject of the causative verb) is unified with the subject the inner f-structure. If the original verb is transitive, the object of the original verb is further unified with the OBJTH of the causative verb. All of grammatical functions in the inner f-structure, namely XCOMP, are also represented in the mother f-structure and are placed as arguments of caus since the flat representation is required to enable free word order in sentence level.","Though not explicit in the sample f-structures, the important part is unifying the object and for-mer subject with appropriate case markers, since the functions of the phrases in the sentence are decided with the help of case markers due to free word order. If the verb that is causativized subcategorizes for an direct object in accusative case, after causative formation, the new object unified with the subject of the causativized verb should be in dative case (Example 15). But if the verb in question subcategorizes for a dative or an ablative oblique object, then this object will be transformed into a direct object in accusative case after causativization (Example 16). That is, the causativation will select the case of the object of the causative verb, so as not to “interfere” with the object of the verb that is causativized. In causativized intransitive verbs the causative object is always in accusative case. 158","(15) a. adam man-NOM kadını woman-ACC aradı. call-PAST ‘the man called the woman’","b. adama man-DAT kadını woman-ACC arattı. call-CAUS-PAST","‘(s/he) made the man call the woman’","(16) a. adam man-NOM kadına woman-DAT vurdu. hit-PAST ‘the man hit the woman’","b. adamı man-ACC kadına woman-DAT vurdurdu. hit-CAUS-PAST","‘(s/he) made the man hit the woman’ All other derivational phenomena can be solved in a similar way by establishing the appropriate semantic representation for the derived IG and its effect on the semantic representation."]},{"title":"5 Current Implementation","paragraphs":["The implementation of the Turkish LFG grammar is based on the Xerox Linguistic Environment (XLE) (Maxwell III and Kaplan, 1996), a grammar development platform that facilitates the integration of various modules, such as tokenizers, finite-state morphological analyzers, and lexicons.
