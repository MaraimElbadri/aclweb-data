This often leads to considerable ambiguity since several words that have different diacritic patterns may appear identical in a diacritic-less setting. Educated modern Arabic speakers are able to accurately restore diacritics in a document. This is based on the context and their knowledge of the grammar and the lexicon of Arabic. However, a text without diacritics becomes a source of confusion for beginning readers and people with learning disabilities. A text without diacritics is also problematic for applications such as text-to-speech or speech-to-text, where the lack of diacritics adds another layer of ambiguity when processing the data. As an example, full vocalization of text is required for text-to-speech applications, where the mapping from graphemes to phonemes is simple compared to languages such as English and French; where there is, in most cases, one-to-one relationship. Also, using data with diacritics shows an improvement in the accuracy of speech-recognition applications (Afify et al., 2004). Currently, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and other applications use data where diacritics are placed manually, which is a tedious and time consuming excercise. A diacritization system that restores the diacritics of scripts, i.e. supply the full diacritical markings, would be of interest to these applications. It also would greatly benefit nonnative speakers, sufferers of dyslexia and could assist in restoring diacritics of children’s and poetry books, a task that is currently done manually. We propose in this paper a statistical approach that restores diacritics in a text document. The proposed approach is based on the maximum entropy framework where several diverse sources of information are employed. The model implicitly learns the correlation between these types of information and the output diacritics. In the next section, we present the set of diacritics to be restored and the ambiguity we face when processing a non-diacritized text. Section 3 gives a brief summary of previous related works. Section 4 presents our diacritization model; we explain the training and decoding process as well as the different feature categories employed to restore the diacritics. Section 5 describes a clearly defined and replicable split of the LDC’s Arabic Treebank Part 3 corpus, used to built and evaluate the system, so that the reproduction of the results and future comparison can accurately be established. Section 6 presents the experimental results. Section 7 reports a comparison of our approach to the finite state machine modeling technique that showed promissing results in (Nelken and Shieber, 2005).

Short vowels are written as symbols either above or below the letter in text with diacritics, and dropped all together in text without diacritics.

Similar to short vowels, there are three different diacritics for tanween: tanween al-fatha, tanween al-damma, and tanween al-kasra.

Another, rule-based grapheme to sound conversion approach was appeared in 2003 by Y. El-Imam (El-Imam, 2003). The main drawbacks of these rule based methods is that it is difficult to maintain the rules up-to-date and extend them to other Arabic dialects. Also, new rules are required due to the changing nature of any “living” language. More recently, there have been several new studies that use alternative approaches for the diacritization problem. In (Emam and Fisher, 2004) an example based hierarchical top-down approach is proposed. First, the training data is searched hierarchically for a matching sentence. If there is a matching sentence, the whole utterance is used. Otherwise they search for matching phrases, then words to restore diacritics. If there is no match at all, character n-gram models are used to diacritize each word in the utterance. In (Vergyri and Kirchhoff, 2004), diacritics in conversational Arabic are restored by combining morphological and contextual information with an acoustic signal. Diacritization is treated as an unsupervised tagging problem where each word is tagged as one of the many possible forms provided by the Buckwalter’s morphological analyzer (Buckwalter, 2002). The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to learn the tag sequences. Y. Gal in (Gal, 2002) used a HMM-based diacritization approach. This method is a white-space delimited word based approach that restores only vowels (a subset of all diacritics). Most recently, a weighted finite state machine based algorithm is proposed (Nelken and Shieber, 2005). This method employs characters and larger morphological units in addition to words. Among all the previous studies this one is more sophisticated in terms of integrating multiple information sources and formulating the problem as a search task within a unified framework. This approach also shows competitive results in terms of accuracy when compared to previous studies. In their algorithm, a character based generative diacritization scheme is enabled only for words that do not occur in the training data. It is not clearly stated in the paper whether their method predict the diacritics shedda and sukuun. Even though the methods proposed for diacritic restoration have been maturing and improving over time, they are still limited in terms of coverage and accuracy. In the approach we present in this paper, we propose to restore the most comprehensive list of the diacritics that are used in any Arabic text. Our method differs from the previous approaches in the way the diacritization problem is formulated and because multiple information sources are integrated. We view the diacritic restoration problem as sequence classification, where given a sequence of characters our goal is to assign diacritics to each character. Our appoach is based on Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt henceforth) technique (Berger et al., 1996). MaxEnt can be used for sequence classification, by converting the activation scores into probabilities (through the soft-max function, for instance) and using the standard dynamic programming search algorithm (also known as Viterbi search). We find in the literature several other approaches of sequence classification such as (Mc-Callum et al., 2000) and (Lafferty et al., 2001). The conditional random fields method presented in (Lafferty et al., 2001) is essentially a MaxEnt model over the entire sequence: it differs from the Maxent in that it models the sequence information, whereas the Maxent makes a decision for each state independently of the other states. The approach presented in (McCallum et al., 2000) combines Maxent with Hidden Markov models to allow observations to be presented as arbitrary overlapping features, and define the probability of state sequences given observation sequences. We report in section 7 a comparative study between our approach and the most competitive diacritic restoration method that uses finite state machine algorithm (Nelken and Shieber, 2005). The MaxEnt framework was successfully used to combine a diverse collection of information sources and yielded a highly competitive model that achieves a 5.1% DER."]},{"title":"4 Automatic Diacritization","paragraphs":["The performance of many natural language processing tasks, such as shallow parsing (Zhang et al., 2002) and named entity recognition (Florian et al., 2004), has been shown to depend on integrating many sources of information. Given the stated focus of integrating many feature types, we selected the MaxEnt classifier. MaxEnt has the ability to integrate arbitrary types of information and make a classification decision by aggregating all information available for a given classification. 4.1 Maximum Entropy Classifiers We formulate the task of restoring diacritics as a classification problem, where we assign to each character in the text a label (i.e., diacritic). Before formally describing the method1",", we introduce some notations: let Y = { y1, . . . , yn} be the set of diacritics to predict or restore, X be the example space and F = { 0, 1} m","be a feature space.

Given these weights, the model computes the probability distribution over labels for a particular example x as follows: P (y| x) = 1 Z(x) m ∏ j=1 α fj(x) ij , Z(x) = ∑ i ∏ j α fj(x) ij where Z(X ) is a normalization factor. To estimate the optimal αj values, we train our MaxEnt model using the sequential conditional generalized iterative scaling (SCGIS) technique (Goodman, 2002). While the MaxEnt method can nicely integrate multiple feature types seamlessly, in certain cases it is known to overestimate its confidence in especially low-frequency features. To overcome this problem, we use the regularization method based on adding Gaussian priors as described in (Chen and Rosenfeld, 2000). After computing the class probability distribution, the chosen diacritic is the one with the most aposteriori probability. The decoding algorithm, described in section 4.2, performs sequence classification, through dynamic programming. 4.2 Search to Restore Diacritics We are interested in finding the diacritics of all characters in a script or a sentence. These diacritics have strong interdependencies which can-not be properly modeled if the classification is performed independently for each character. We view this problem as sequence classification, as contrasted with an example-based classification problem: given a sequence of characters in a sentence x1x2 . . . xL, our goal is to assign diacritics (labels) to each character, resulting in a sequence of diacritics y1y2 . . . yL. We make an assumption that diacritics can be modeled as a limited order Markov sequence: the diacritic associated with the character i depends only on the diacritics associated with the k previous diacritics, where k is usually equal to 3. Given this assumption, and the nota-tion xL","1 = x1 . . . xL, the conditional probability of assigning the diacritic sequence yL","1 to the character","sequence xL 1 becomes p ( yL 1 | xL","1 ) = p (","y1| xL 1 ) p (","y2| xL 1 , y1 ) . . . p (","yL| xL 1 , yL−1","L−k+1 )","(1) and our goal is to find the sequence that maximizes this conditional probability","ŷL","1 = arg max","yL","1 p ( yL 1 | xL","1 ) (2) While we restricted the conditioning on the classification tag sequence to the previous k diacritics, we do not impose any restrictions on the conditioning on the characters – the probability is computed using the entire character sequence xL","1 . To obtain the sequence in Equation (2), we create a classification tag lattice (also called trellis), as follows:","• Let xL","1 be the input sequence of character and S = { s1, s2, . . . , sm} be an enumeration of Yk (m = |Y | k",") - we will call an element sj a state. Every such state corresponds to the labeling of k successive characters. We find it useful to think of an element si as a vector with k elements. We use the notations si [j] for jth element of such a vector (the label associated with the token xi−k+j+1) and si [j1 . . . j2] for the sequence of elements between indices j1 and j2.","• We conceptually associate every character xi, i = 1, . . . , L with a copy of S, Si","={ si 1, . . . , si","m } ; this set represents all the possi-","ble labelings of characters xi","i−k+1 at the stage where xi is examined.","• We then create links from the set Si","to the Si+1",", for all i = 1 . . .

To reduce the search space, we use beam-search. 4.3 Features Employed Within the MaxEnt framework, any type of features can be used, enabling the system designer to experiment with interesting feature types, rather than worry about specific feature interactions. In contrast, with a rule based system, the system designer would have to consider how, for instance, lexical derived information for a particular example interacts with character context information. That is not to say, ultimately, that rule-based systems are in some way inferior to statistical models – they are built using valuable insight which is hard to obtain from a statistical-model-only approach. Instead, we are merely suggesting that the output of such a rule-based system can be easily integrated into the MaxEnt framework as one of the input features, most likely leading to improved performance. Features employed in our system can be divided into three different categories: lexical, segment-based, and part-of-speech tag (POS) features. We also use the previously assigned two diacritics as additional features. In the following, we briefly describe the different categories of features:","• Lexical Features: we include the character n-gram spanning the curent character xi, both preceding and following it in a window of 7: { xi−3, . . . , xi+3} . We use the current word wi and its word context in a window of 5 (forward and backward trigram): { wi−2, . . . , wi+2} . We specify if the character of analysis is at the beginning or at the end of a word. We also add joint features between the above source of information.","• Segment-Based Features : Arabic blank-delimited words are composed of zero or more prefixes, followed by a stem and zero or more suffixes. Each prefix, stem or suffix will be called a segment in this paper. Segments are often the subject of analysis when processing Arabic (Zitouni et al., 2005). Syntactic information such as POS or parse information is usually computed on segments rather than words. As an example, the Arabic white-space delimited word"]},{"title":"DK̊.

The corpus includes complete vocalization (including case-endings). We introduce here a clearly defined and replicable split of the corpus, so that the reproduction of the results or future investigations can accurately and correctly be established. This corpus includes 600 documents from the An Nahar News Text. There are a total of 340,281 words. We split the corpus into two sets: training data and de-velopment test (devtest) data.

The DER is the proportion of incorrectly restored diacritics. The WER is the percentage of incorrectly diacritized white-space delimited words: in order to be counted as incorrect, at least one character in the word must have a diacritization error. The SER is similar to WER but indicates the proportion of incorrectly diacritized segments. A segment can be a prefix, a stem, or a suffix. Segments are often the subject of analysis when processing Arabic (Zitouni et al., 2005). Syntactic information such as POS or parse information is based on segments rather than words. Consequently, it is important to know the SER in cases where the diacritization system may be used to help disambiguate syntactic information. Several modern Arabic scripts contains the consonant doubling “shadda”; it is common for native speakers to write without diacritics except the shadda. In this case the role of the diacritization system will be to restore the short vowels, doubled case ending, and the vowel absence “sukuun”. We run two batches of experiments: a first experiment where documents contain the original shadda and a second one where documents don’t contain any diacritics including the shadda. The diacritization system proceeds in two steps when it has to predict the shadda: a first step where only shadda is restored and a second step where other diacritics (excluding shadda) are predicted. To assess the performance of the system under different conditions, we consider three cases based on the kind of features employed: 1. system that has access to lexical features only;","2. system that has access to lexical and segment-based features;","3. system that has access to lexical, segment-based and POS features.

The system they described in (Nelken and Shieber, 2005) uses lexical, segment-based, and morphological information. Table 2 also shows that, when segment-based information is added to our system, a significant improvement is achieved: 25% for WER (18.8 vs. 25.1), 38% for SER (9.4 vs. 13.0), and 41% for DER (5.8 vs. 8.2). Similar be-havior is observed when the documents contain the original shadda. POS features are also helpful in improving the performance of the system. They improved the WER by 4% (18.0 vs. 18.8), SER by 5% (8.9 vs. 9.4), and DER by 5% (5.5 vs. 5.8). Case-ending in Arabic documents consists of the diacritic attributed to the last character in a white-space delimited word. Restoring them is the most difficult part in the diacritization of a document. Case endings are only present in formal or highly literary scripts. Only educated speakers of modern standard Arabic master their use. Technically, every noun has such an ending, although at the end of a sentence no inflection is pronounced, even in formal speech, because of the rules of ‘pause’. For this reason, we conduct another experiment in which case-endings were stripped throughout the training and testing data without the attempt to restore them. We present in Table 3 the performance of the diacritization system on documents without case-endings. Results clearly show that when case-endings are omitted, the WER declines by 58% (7.2% vs. 17.3%), SER is decreased by 52% (4.0% vs. 8.5%), and DER is reduced by 56% (2.2% vs. 5.1%).

Because they didn’t describe how they split their corpus into training/test sets, we were not able to use the same data for comparison purpose. In this section, we want essentially to duplicate the aforementioned FST result for comparison using the identical training and testing set we use for our experiments. We also propose some new variations on the finite state machine modeling technique which improve performance considerably. The algorithm for FST based vowel restoration could not be simpler: between every pair of characters we insert diacritics if doing so improves the likelihood of the sequence as scored by a statistical n-gram model trained upon the training corpus. Thus, in between every pair of characters we propose and score all possible diacritical insertions. Results reported in Table 4 indicate the error rates of diacritic restoration (including shadda). We show performance using both Kneser-Ney and Katz LMs (Chen and Goodman, 1999) with increasingly large n-grams. It is our opinion that large n-grams effectively duplicate the use of a lexicon. It is unfortunate but true that, even for a rich resource like the Arabic Treebank, the choice of modeling heuristic and the effects of small sample size are considerable. Using the finite state machine modeling technique, we obtain similar results to those reported in (Nelken and Shieber, 2005): a WER of 23% and a DER of 15%. Better performance is reached with the use of Kneser-Ney LM. These results still under-perform those obtained by MaxEnt approach presented in Table 2. When all sources of information are included, the MaxEnt technique outperforms the FST model by 21% (22% vs. 18%) in terms of WER and 39% (9% vs. 5.5%) in terms of DER. The SER reported on Table 2 and Table 3 are based on the Arabic segmentation system we use in the MaxEnt approach. Since, the FST model doesn’t use such a system, we found inappropriate to report SER in this section.","Katz LM Kneser-Ney LM","n-gram size WER DER WER DER 3 63 31 55 28 4 54 25 38 19 5 51 21 28 13 6 44 18 24 11 7 39 16 23 11 8 37 15 23 10 Table 4: Error Rate in % for n-gram diacritic restoration using FST. We propose in the following an extension to the aforementioned FST model, where we jointly de-termines not only diacritics but segmentation into affixes as described in (Lee et al., 2003). Table 5 gives the performance of the extended FST model where Kneser-Ney LM is used, since it produces better results. This should be a much more difficult task, as there are more than twice as many possible insertions. However, the choice of diacritics is related to and dependent upon the choice of segmentation. Thus, we demonstrate that a richer internal representation produces a more powerful model."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We presented in this paper a statistical model for Arabic diacritic restoration. The approach we propose is based on the Maximum entropy framework, which gives the system the ability to integrate different sources of knowledge. Our model has the advantage of successfully combining diverse sources of information ranging from lexical, segment-based and POS features. Both POS and segment-based features are generated by separate statistical systems – not extracted manually – in order to simulate real world applications. The segment-based features are extracted from a statistical morphological analysis system using WFST approach and the POS features are generated by a parsing model"]},{"title":"583","paragraphs":["True Shadda Predicted Shadda","n-gram size Kneser-Ney Kneser-Ney","WER DER WER DER 3 49 23 52 27 4 34 14 35 17 5 26 11 26 12 6 23 10 23 10 7 23 9 22 10 8 23 9 22 10 Table 5: Error Rate in % for n-gram diacritic restoration and segmentation using FST and Kneser-Ney LM.

Evaluation results show that combining these sources of information lead to state-of-the-art performance. As future work, we plan to incorporate Buckwalter morphological analyzer information to extract new features that reduce the search space. One idea will be to reduce the search to the number of hypotheses, if any, proposed by the morphological analyzer. We also plan to investigate additional conjunction features to improve the accuracy of the model."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["Grateful thanks are extended to Radu Florian for his constructive comments regarding the maximum entropy classifier."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["M.
