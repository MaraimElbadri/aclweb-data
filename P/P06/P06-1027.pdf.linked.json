The attractiveness of semi-supervised learning for language tasks is further heightened by the fact that the models learned are large and complex, and generally even thousands of labeled examples can only sparsely cover the parameter space. Moreover, in complex structured prediction tasks, such as parsing or sequence modeling (part-of-speech tagging, word segmentation, named entity recognition, and so on), it is considerably more difficult to obtain labeled training data than for classification tasks (such as document classification), since hand-labeling individual words and word boundaries is much harder than assigning text-level class labels.","Many approaches have been proposed for semi-supervised learning in the past, including: generative models (Castelli and Cover 1996; Cohen and Cozman 2006; Nigam et al. 2000), self-learning (Celeux and Govaert 1992; Yarowsky 1995), co-training (Blum and Mitchell 1998), information-theoretic regularization (Corduneanu and Jaakkola 2006; Grandvalet and Bengio 2004), and graph-based transductive methods (Zhou et al. 2004; Zhou et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 2003). Unfortunately, these techniques have been developed primarily for single class label classification problems, or class label classification with a structured input (Zhou et al. 2004; Zhou et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 2003). Although still highly desirable, semi-supervised learning for structured classification problems like sequence segmentation and labeling have not been as widely studied as in the other semi-supervised settings mentioned above, with the sole exception of generative models.","With generative models, it is natural to include unlabeled data using an expectation-maximization approach (Nigam et al. 2000). However, generative models generally do not achieve the same accuracy as discriminatively trained models, and therefore it is preferable to focus on discriminative approaches. Unfortunately, it is far from obvious how unlabeled training data can be naturally in-corporated into a discriminative training criterion. For example, unlabeled data simply cancels from the objective if one attempts to use a traditional conditional likelihood criterion. Nevertheless, recent progress has been made on incorporating unlabeled data in discriminative training procedures. For example, dependencies can be introduced between the labels of nearby instances and thereby have an effect on training (Zhu et al. 2003; Li and McCallum 2005; Altun et al. 2005). These models are trained to encourage nearby data points to have the same class label, and they can obtain impressive accuracy using a very small amount of labeled data. However, since they model pairwise similarities among data points, most of these approaches require joint inference over the whole data set at test time, which is not practical for large data sets.","In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised training method for conditional random fields (CRFs) that incorporates both labeled and unlabeled sequence data to estimate a discriminative 209 structured predictor. CRFs are a fle xible and powerful model for structured predictors based on undirected graphical models that have been globally conditioned on a set of input covariates (Lafferty et al. 2001). CRFs have proved to be particularly useful for sequence segmentation and labeling tasks, since, as conditional models of the labels given inputs, they relax the independence as-sumptions made by traditional generative models like hidden Markov models. As such, CRFs provide additional fle xibility for using arbitrary over-lapping features of the input sequence to define a structured conditional model over the output sequence, while maintaining two advantages: first, efficient dynamic program can be used for inference in both classification and training, and second, the training objective is concave in the model parameters, which permits global optimization.","To obtain a new semi-supervised training algorithm for CRFs, we extend the minimum entropy regularization framework of Grandvalet and Bengio (2004) to structured predictors. The resulting objective combines the likelihood of the CRF on labeled training data with its conditional entropy on unlabeled training data. Unfortunately, the maximization objective is no longer concave, but we can still use it to effectively improve an initial supervised model. To develop an effective training procedure, we first show how the derivative of the new objective can be computed from the covariance matrix of the features on the unlabeled data (combined with the labeled conditional likelihood). This relationship facilitates the development of an efficient dynamic programming for computing the gradient, and thereby allows us to perform efficient iterative ascent for training. We apply our new training technique to the problem of sequence labeling and segmentation, and demonstrate it specifically on the problem of identifying gene and protein mentions in biological texts. Our results show the advantage of semi-supervised learning over the standard supervised algorithm."]},{"title":"2 Semi-supervised CRF training","paragraphs":["In what follows, we use the same notation as (Lafferty et al. 2001).

The motivation is that minimizing conditional entropy over unlabeled data encourages the algorithm to find putative labelings for the unlabeled data that are mutually reinforcing with the supervised labels; that is, greater certainty on the putative labelings coincides with greater conditional likelihood on the supervised labels, and vice versa. For a single classification variable this criterion has been shown to effectively partition unlabeled data into clusters (Grandvalet and Bengio 2004; Roberts et al. 2000).","To motivate the approach in more detail, consider the overlap between the probability distribu-tion over a label sequence","and the empirical distribution of",""," on the unlabeled data ",".

It is well known that Kullback-Leibler divergence (Cover and Thomas 1991) is positive and increases as the overlap between the two distributions decreases.

However, our contention is that stronger results could be obtained in this domain by exploiting a large corpus of unannotated biomedical text to improve the quality of the predictions, which we now show.","Given a biomedical text, the task of identifying gene mentions can be interpreted as a tagging task, where each word in the text can be labeled with a tag that indicates whether it is the beginning of gene mention (B), the continuation of a gene mention (I), or outside of any gene mention (O).
