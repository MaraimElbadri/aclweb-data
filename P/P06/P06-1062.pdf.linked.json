Based on the Document Object Model (DOM), a web page is represented as a DOM tree. Then a DOM tree alignment model is proposed to identify the translationally equivalent texts and hyperlinks between two parallel DOM trees. By tracing the identified parallel hyperlinks, parallel web documents are recursively mined. Compared with previous mining schemes, the benchmarks show that this new mining scheme improves the mining coverage, reduces mining bandwidth, and enhances the quality of mined parallel sentences."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Parallel bilingual corpora are critical resources for statistical machine translation (Brown 1993), and cross-lingual information retrieval (Nie 1999). Additionally, parallel corpora have been exploited for various monolingual natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as wordsense disambiguation (Ng 2003) and paraphrase acquisition (Callison 2005).","However, large scale parallel corpora are not readily available for most language pairs. Even where resources are available, such as for English-French, the data are usually restricted to government documents (e.g., the Hansard corpus, which consists of French-English translations of debates in the Canadian parliament) or newswire texts. The \"governmentese\" that characterizes these document collections cannot be used on its own to train data-driven machine translation systems for a range of domains and language pairs.","With a sharply increasing number of bilingual web sites, web mining for parallel data becomes a promising solution to this knowledge acquisition problem. In an effort to estimate the amount of bilingual data on the web, (Ma and Liberman 1999) surveyed web pages in the de (German web site) domain, showing that of 150,000 websites in the .de domain, 10% are German-English bilingual. Based on such observations, some web mining systems have been developed to automatically obtain parallel corpora from the web (Nie et al 1999; Ma and Liberman 1999; Chen, Chau and Yeh 2004; Resnik and Smith 2003 Zhang et al 2006 ). These systems mine parallel web documents within bilingual web sites, exploiting the fact that URLs of many parallel web pages are named with apparent patterns to facilitate website maintenance. Hence given a bilingual website, the mining systems use pre-defined URL patterns to discover candidate parallel documents within the site. Then content-based features will be used to verify the translational equivalence of the candidate pairs.","However, due to the diversity of web page styles and website maintenance mechanisms, bilingual websites use varied naming schemes for parallel documents. For example, the United Nation’s website, which contains thousands of parallel pages, simply names the majority of its web pages with some computer generated ad-hoc URLs. Such a website then cannot be mined by the URL pattern-based mining scheme. To further improve the coverage of web mining, other patterns associated with translational parallelism are called for.","Besides, URL pattern-based mining may raise concerns on high bandwidth cost and slow download speed. Based on descriptions of (Nie et al 1999; Ma and Liberman 1999; Chen, Chau and Yeh 2004), the mining process requires a full host crawling to collect URLs before using URL patterns to discover the parallel documents. Since in many bilingual web sites, parallel documents are much sparser than comparable documents, a significant portion of internet bandwidth is wasted on downloading web pages without translational counterparts.","Furthermore, there is a lack of discussion on the quality of mined data. To support machine translation, parallel sentences should be extracted from the mined parallel documents. However, current sentence alignment models, (Brown et al 1991; Gale & Church 1991; Wu 1994; Chen 489 1993; Zhao and Vogel, 2002; etc.) are targeted on traditional textual documents. Due to the noisy nature of the web documents, parallel web pages may consist of non-translational content and many out-of-vocabulary words, both of which reduce sentence alignment accuracy. To improve sentence alignment performance on the web data, the similarity of the HTML tag structures between the parallel web documents should be leveraged properly in the sentence alignment model.","In order to improve the quality of mined data and increase the mining coverage and speed, this paper proposes a new web parallel data mining scheme. Given a pair of parallel web pages as seeds, the Document Object Model 1","(DOM) is used to represent the web pages as a pair of DOM trees. Then a stochastic DOM tree alignment model is used to align translationally equivalent content, including both textual chunks and hyperlinks, between the DOM tree pairs. The parallel hyperlinks discovered are regarded as anchors to new parallel data. This makes the mining scheme an iterative process.","The new mining scheme has three advantages: (i) Mining coverage is increased. Parallel hyperlinks referring to parallel web page is a general and reliable pattern for parallel data mining. Many bilingual websites not supporting URL pattern-based mining scheme support this new mining scheme. Our mining experiment shows that, using the new web mining scheme, the web mining throughput is increased by 32%; (ii) The quality of the mined data is improved. By leveraging the web pages’ HTML structures, the sentence aligner supported by the DOM tree alignment model outperforms conventional ones by 7% in both precision and recall; (iii) The bandwidth cost is reduced by restricting web page downloads to the links that are very likely to be parallel.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we introduce the related work. In Section 3, a new web parallel data mining scheme is presented. Three component technologies, the DOM tree alignment model, the sentence aligner, and the candidate parallel page verification model are presented in Section 4, 5, and 6. Section 7 presents experiments and benchmarks. The paper is finally concluded in Section 8. 1 See http://www.w3.org/DOM/"]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["The parallel data available on the web have been an important knowledge source for machine translation. For example, Hong Kong Laws, an English-Chinese Parallel corpus released by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) is downloaded from the Department of Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region website.","Recently, web mining systems have been built to automatically acquire parallel data from the web. Exemplary systems include PTMiner (Nie et al 1999), STRAND (Resnik and Smith, 2003), BITS (Ma and Liberman, 1999), and PTI (Chen, Chau and Yeh, 2004). Given a bilingual website, these systems identify candidate parallel documents using pre-defined URL patterns. Then content-based features are employed for candidate verification. Particularly, HTML tag similarities have been exploited to verify parallelism between pages. But it is done by simplifying HTML tags as a string sequence instead of a hierarchical DOM tree. Tens of thousands parallel documents have been acquired with accuracy over 90%.","To support machine translation, parallel sentence pairs should be extracted from the parallel web documents. A number of techniques for aligning sentences in parallel corpora have been proposed. (Gale & Church 1991; Brown et al. 1991; Wu 1994) used sentence length as the basic feature for alignment. (Kay & Roscheisen 1993; and Chen 1993) used lexical information for sentence alignment. Models combining length and lexicon information were proposed in (Zhao and Vogel, 2002; Moore 2002). Signal processing techniques is also employed in sentence alignment by (Church 1993; Fung & McKeown 1994). Recently, much research atten-tion has been paid to aligning sentences in comparable documents (Utiyama et al 2003, Munteanu et al 2004).","The DOM tree alignment model is the key technique of our mining approach. Although, to our knowledge, this is the first work discussing DOM tree alignments, there is substantial research focusing on syntactic tree alignment model for machine translation. For example, (Wu 1997; Alshawi, Bangalore, and Douglas, 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001) have studied synchronous context free grammar. This formalism requires isomorphic syntax trees for the source sentence and its translation. (Shieber and Schabes 1990) presents a synchronous tree adjoining grammar (STAG) which is able to align two syn-490 tactic trees at the linguistic minimal units. The synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG) presented in (Hajic etc. 2004) is a simplified version of STAG which allows tree substitution operation, but prohibits the operation of tree adjunction."]},{"title":"3 A New Parallel Data Mining Scheme Supported by DOM Tree Alignment","paragraphs":["Our new web parallel data mining scheme con-","sists of the following steps: ","(1) Given a web site, the root page and web pages directly linked from the root page are downloaded. Then for each of the downloaded web page, all of its anchor texts (i.e. the hyperlinked words on a web page) are compared with a list of predefined strings known to reflect translational equivalence among web pages (Nie et al 1999). Examples of such predefined trigger strings include: (i) trigger words for English translation {English, English Version,  ,  ",", etc.}; and (ii) trigger words for Chinese translation {Chinese, Chinese Version, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese,  ,  ",", etc.}. If both categories of trigger words are found, the web site is considered bilingual, and every web page pair are sent to Step 2 for parallelism verification.","(2) Given a pair of the plausible parallel web pages, a verification module is called to determine if the page pair is truly translationally equivalent.","(3) For each verified pair of parallel web pages, a DOM tree alignment model is called to extract parallel text chunks and hyperlinks.","(4) Sentence alignment is performed on each pair of the parallel text chunks, and the resulting parallel sentences are saved in an output file.","(5) For each pair of parallel hyperlinks, the corresponding pair of web pages is downloaded, and then goes to Step 2 for parallelism verification. If no more parallel hyperlinks are found, stop the mining process. Our new mining scheme is iterative in nature.","It fully exploits the information contained in the","parallel data and effectively uses it to pinpoint","the location holding more parallel data. This ap-","proach is based on our observation that parallel","pages share similar structures holding parallel","content, and parallel hyperlinks refer to new par-","allel pages.","By exploiting both the HTML tag similarity and the content-based translational equivalences, the DOM tree alignment model extracts parallel text chunks. Working on the parallel text chunks instead of the text of the whole web page, the sentence alignment accuracy can be improved by a large margin.","In the next three sections, three component techniques, the DOM tree alignment model, sentence alignment model, and candidate web page pair verification model are introduced."]},{"title":"4 DOM Tree Alignment Model","paragraphs":["The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface for valid HTML documents. Using DOM, the logical structure of a HTML document is represented as a tree where each node belongs to some pre-defined node types (e.g. Document, DocumentType, Element, Text, Comment, ProcessingInstruction etc.). Among all these types of nodes, the nodes most relevant to our purpose are Element nodes (corresponding to the HTML tags) and Text nodes (corresponding to the texts). To simplify the description of the alignment model, minor modifications of the standard DOM tree are made: (i) Only the Element nodes and Text nodes are kept in our document tree model. (ii) The ALT attribute is represented as Text node in our document tree model. The ALT text are textual alternative when images cannot be displayed, hence is helpful to align images and hyperlinks. (iii) the Text node (which must be a leaf) and its parent Element node are combined into one node in order to concise the representation of the alignment model. The above three modifications are exemplified in Fig. 1.","","","Fig. 1 Difference between Standard DOM and Our Document Tree  Despite these minor differences, our document tree is still referred as DOM tree throughout this paper. 491 4.1 DOM Tree Alignment Similar to STSG, our DOM tree alignment model supports node deletion, insertion and substitution. Besides, both STSG and our DOM tree alignment model define the alignment as a tree hierarchical invariance process, i.e. if node A is aligned with node B, then the children of A are either deleted or aligned with the children of B.","But two major differences exist between STSG and our DOM tree alignment model: (i) Our DOM tree alignment model requires the alignment a sequential order invariant process, i.e. if node A is aligned with node B, then the sibling nodes following A have to be either deleted or aligned with the sibling nodes following B. (ii) (Hajic etc. 2004) presents STSG in the context of language generation, while we search for the best alignment on the condition that both trees are given.","To facilitate the presentation of the tree alignment model, the following symbols are introduced: given a HTML document D, D","T refers to the corresponding DOM tree; D","iN refers to the i","th","","node of D","T (here the index of the node is in the","breadth-first order), and D","iT refers to the sub-tree","rooted at D","iN , so D","1N refers to the root of D","T ,","and D T=D","1T ; [ ]D","ji,T refers to the forest consisting","of the sub-trees rooted at nodes from D","iT to D","jT .","t.N D","i refers to the text of node D","iN ; l.N D","i refers to","the HTML tag of the node D iN ; jC.N D","i refers to the j","th","child of the node D","iN ; [ ]nmC ,D","i .N refers to","the consecutive sequence of D iN ’s children nodes","from mC.N D i to nC.N D","i ; the sub-tree rooted at jC.N D","i is represented as jTC.N D","i and the forest rooted at [ ]nmC ,D","i .N is represented as [ ]nmTC ,D","i .N .

And each website is sent to the mining system for English-Chinese parallel data acquisition. To ensure that the whole mining experiment to be finished in schedule, we stipulate that it takes at most 10 hours on mining each website. Totally 11,000 English-Chinese websites are discovered, from which 63,214 pairs of English-Chinese parallel web documents are mined. After sentence alignment, totally 1,069,423 pairs of English-Chinese parallel sentences are extracted.","In order to compare the system performance, 100 English-Chinese bilingual websites are also mined using the URL pattern based mining scheme. Following (Nie et al 1999; Ma and Liberman 1999; Chen, Chau and Yeh 2004), the URL pattern-based mining consists of three steps: (i) host crawling for URL collection; (ii) candidate pair identification by pre-defined URL pattern matching; (iii) candidate pair verification.","Based on these mining results, the quality of the mined data, the mining coverage and mining efficiency are measured.","First, we benchmarked the precision of the mined parallel documents. 3,000 pairs of English-Chinese candidate documents are randomly selected from the output of each mining system, and are reviewed by human annotators.
