It is funded within the Norwegian Research Council program for building national infrastructure for language technology (Fenstad et al., 2006). It is the goal for the program as well as for the project to in-clude various areas of language technology as well as various methods, in particular symbolic and empirical methods. Besides, the project aims at reusing available resources and, in turn, producing re-usable technology.","In spite of signicant progress in statistical approaches to machine translation, we doubt the long-term value of pure statistical (or data-driven) approaches, both practically and scientically. To ensure grammaticality of outputs as well as felicity of the translation both linguistic grammars and deep semantic analysis are needed. The architecture of the LOGON system hence consists of a symbolic backbone system combined with various stochastic components for ranking system hypotheses. In a nutshell, a central research question in LOGON is to what degree state-of-the-art ‘deep’ NLP resources can contribute towards a precision MT system. We hope to engage the conference audience in some reection on this question by means of the interactive presentation."]},{"title":"2 System Design","paragraphs":["The backbone of the LOGON prototype imple-ments a relatively conventional architecture, orga-","∗","This demonstration reects the work of a large group of people whose contributions we gratefully acknowledge.

Event- and instance-type variables (‘ej’ and ‘xk’, respectively) capture semantic linking among EPs, where we assume a small inventory of thematically bleached role labels (ARG0 ... ARGn). These are abbreviated through order-coding in the example above (see § 2 below for details). nized around in-depth grammatical analysis in the source language (SL), semantic transfer of logical-form meaning representations from the source into the target language (TL), and full, grammar-based TL tactical generation. Minimal Recursion Semantics The three core phases communicate in a uniform semantic interface language, Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS; Copestake, Flickinger, Sag, & Pollard, 1999). Broadly speaking, MRS is a at, eventbased (neo-Davidsonian) framework for computational semantics. The abstraction from SL and TL surface properties enforced in our semantic transfer approach facilitates a novel combination of diverse grammatical frameworks, viz. LFG for Norwegian analysis and HPSG for English generation.","While an in-depth introduction to MRS (for MT) is beyond the scope of this project note, Figure 1 presents a simplied example semantics. Norwegian Analysis Syntactic analysis of Norwegian is based on an existing LFG resource grammar, NorGram (Dyvik, 1999), under development on the Xerox Linguistic Environment (XLE) since around 1999. For use in LOGON, the grammar has been modied and extended, and it has been augmented with a module of Minimal Recursion Semantics representations which are computed from LFG f-structures by co-description.","In Norwegian, compounding is a productive morphological process, thus presenting the analysis engine with a steady supply of ‘new’ words, e.g. something like klokkeslettuttrykk meaning ap-53 Norwegian Analysis (LFG) PVM NorGram Lexicon"," Norwegian SEM-I  ","LOGON","Controller PVM English","Generation","(HPSG) ERG Lexicon  English SEM-I   NO → EN Transfer (MRS) PVM  GUI  WWW Figure 2: Schematic system architecture: the three core processing components are managed by a central controller that passes intermediate results (MRSs) through the translation pipeline.

The project uses its own morphological analyzer, compiled off a comprehesive computational lexicon of Norwegian, prior to syntactic analysis. One important feature of this processor is that it decomposes compounds in such a way that they can be compositionally translated downstream.","Current analysis coverage (including well-formed MRSs) on the LOGON corpus (see below) is approaching 80 per cent (of which 25 per cent are ‘fragmented’, i.e. approximative analyses). Semantic Transfer Unlike in parsing and generation, there is less established common wisdom in terms of (semantic) transfer formalisms and algorithms. LOGON follows many of the main Verbmobil ideastransfer as a resource-sensitive rewrite process, where rules replace MRS frag-ments (SL to TL) in a step-wise manner (Wahlster, 2000)b ut adds two innovative elements to the transfer component, viz. (i) the use of typing for hierarchical organization of transfer rules and (ii) a chart-like treatment of transfer-level ambiguity. The general form of MRS transfer rules (MTRs) is as a quadruple:","[ CONTEXT : ] INPUT [ ! FILTER ] → OUTPUT where each of the four components, in turn, is a partial MRS, i.e. triplet of a top handle, bag of EPs, and handle constraints. Left-hand side components are unied against an input MRS M and, when successful, trigger the rule application; elements of M matched by INPUT are replaced with the OUTPUT component, respecting all variable bindings established during unication. The optional CONTEXT and FILTER components serve to condition rule application (on the presence or absence of specic aspects of M ), establish bindings for OUTPUT processing, but do not consume elements of M .

In close analogy to constraint-based grammar, typing facilitates generalizations over transfer regularitieshierarch ies of predicates or common MTR congurations, for exampleand aids development and debugging.","An important tool in the constructions of the transfer rules are the semantic interfaces (called SEM-Is, see below) of the respective grammars. While we believe that hand-crafted lexical transfer is a necessary component in precision-oriented MT, it is also a bottleneck for the development of the LOGON system, with its pre-existing source and target language grammars. We have therefore experimented with the acquistion of transfer rules by analogy from a bi-lingual dictionary, building on hand-built transfer rules as a seed set of tem-plates (Nordgard, Nygaard, Lłnning, & Oepen, 2006). English Generation Realization of post-transfer MRSs in LOGON builds on the pre-existing LinGO English Resource Grammar (ERG; Flickinger, 2000) and LKB generator (Carroll, Copestake, Flickinger, & Poznanski, 1999). The ERG already produced MRS outputs with good coverage in several domains. In LOGON, it has been rened, adopted to the new domain, and semantic representations revised in light of cross-linguistic experiences from MT. Furthermore, chart generation efciency and integration with stochastic realization have been substantially improved (Carroll & Oepen, 2005).

Temporal, directional, and other usages of prepositions give rise to distinct, but potentially related, semantic predicates. Likewise, the SEM-I incorporates some ontological information, e.g. a classication of temporal entities, though crucially only to the extent that is actually grammaticized in the language proper. development corpus: realizations average at a little less than twelve words in length. After addition of domain-specic vocabulary and a small amount of ne-tuning, the ERG provides adequate analyses for close to ninety per cent of the LOGON reference translations. For about half the test cases, all outputs can be generated in less than one cpu second. End-to-End Coverage The current LOGON system will only produce output(s) when all three processing phases succeed. For the LOGON target corpus (see below), this is presently the case in 35 per cent of cases. Averaging over actual outputs only, the system achieves a (respectable) BLEU score of 0.61; averaging over the entire corpus, i.e. counting inputs with processing errors as a zero contribution, the BLEU score drops to 0.21."]},{"title":"3 Stochastic Components","paragraphs":["To deal with competing hypotheses at all processing levels, LOGON incorporates various stochastic processes for disambiguation. In the following, we present the ones that are best developed to date. Training Material A corpus of some 50,000 words of edited, running Norwegian text was gathered and translated by three professional translators. Three quarters of the material are available for system development and also serve as training data for machine learning approaches. Using the discriminant-based Redwoods approach to treebanking (Oepen, Flickinger, Toutanova, & Manning, 2004), a rst 5,000 English reference translations were hand-annotated and released to the public.1","In on-going work on adapting the Redwoods approach to (Norwegian) LFG, we are working to treebank a sizable text segment (Ros·en, Smedt, Dyvik, & Meurer, 2005; Oepen & Lłnning, 2006). Parse Selection The XLE analyzer includes support for stochastic parse selection models, assign-ing likelihood measures to competing analyses 1","See ‘http://www.delph-in.net/redwoods/’ for the LinGO Redwoods treebank in its latest release, dubbed Norwegian Growth. (Riezler et al., 2002). Using a trial LFG treebank for Norwegian (of less than 100 annotated sentences), we have adapted the tools for the current LOGON version and are now working to train on larger data sets and evaluate parse selection performance. Despite the very limited amount of training so far, the model already appears to pick up on plausible, albeit crude preferences (as regards topicalization, for example). Furthermore, to reduce fan-out in exhaustive processing, we collapse analyses that project equivalent MRSs, i.e. syntactic distinctions made in the grammar but not reected in the semantics. Realization Ranking At an average of more than fty English realizations per input MRS (see Table 1), ranking generator outputs is a vital part of the LOGON pipeline. Based on a notion of automatically derived symmetric treebanks, we have trained comprehensive discriminative, log-linear models that (within the LOGON domain) achieve up to 75 per cent exact match accuracy in pick-ing the most likely realization among competing outputs (Velldal & Oepen, 2005). The bestperforming models make use of congurational (in terms of tree topology) as well as of string-level properties (including local word order and constituent weight), both with varied domains of locality. In total, there are around 300,000 features with non-trivial distribution, and we combine the MaxEnt model with a traditional language model trained on a much larger corpus (the BNC). The latter, more standard approach to realization ranking, when used in isolation only achieves around 50 per cent accuracy, however."]},{"title":"4 Implementation","paragraphs":["Figure 2 presents the main components of the LOGON prototype, where all component communica-tion is in terms of sets of MRSs and, thus, can easily be managed in a distributed and (potentially) parallel client server set-up. Both the analysis and generation grammars ‘publish’ their interface to transferi.e. the inventory and synopsis of seman-55 tic predicatesin the form of a Semantic Interface specication (‘SEM-I’; Flickinger, Lłnning, Dyvik, Oepen, & Bond, 2005), such that transfer can operate without knowledge about grammar internals. In practical terms, SEM-Is are an important development tool (facilitating well-formedness testing of interface representations at all levels), but they also have interesting theoret-ical status with regard to transfer. The SEM-Is for the Norwegian analysis and English generation grammars, respectively, provide an exhaustive enumeration of legitimate semantic predicates (i.e. the transfer vocabulary) and ‘terms of use’, i.e. for each predicate its set of appropriate roles, corresponding value constraints, and indication of (semantic) optionality of roles. Furthermore, the SEM-I provides generalizations over classes of predicatese.g. hierarchical relations like those depicted in Figure 3 belowthat play an important role in the organization of MRS transfer rules."]},{"title":"5 Open-Source Machine Translation","paragraphs":["Despite the recognized need for translation, there is no widely used open-source machine translation system. One of the major reasons for this lack of success is the complexity of the task. By association to the international open-source DELPH-IN effort2","and with its strong emphasis on reusability, LOGON aims to help build a repository of open-source precision tools. This means that work on the MT system benets other projects, and work on other projects can improve the MT system (where EBMT and SMT systems provide results that are harder to re-use). While the XLE software used for Norwegian analysis remains proprietary, we have built an open-source bi-directional Japanese English prototype adaptation of the LOGON system (Bond, Oepen, Siegel, Copestake, & Flickinger, 2005).
