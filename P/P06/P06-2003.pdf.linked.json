The commonly accepted criterion that defines the quality of an evaluation metric is its level of correlation with human evaluators. High levels of correlation (Pearson over 0.9) have been attained at the system level (Eck and Hori, 2005). But this is an average effect: the degree of correlation achieved at the sentence level, crucial for an accurate error analysis, is much lower.","We argue that there is two main reasons that explain this fact:","Firstly, current MT evaluation metrics are based on shallow features. Most metrics work only at the lexical level. However, natural languages are rich and ambiguous, allowing for many possible different ways of expressing the same idea. In order to capture this flexibility, these metrics would require a combinatorial number of reference translations, when indeed in most cases only a single reference is available. Therefore, metrics with higher descriptive power are required.","Secondly, there exists, indeed, two different evaluation criteria: (i) Human Acceptability, i.e., to what extent an automatic translation could be considered acceptable by humans; and (ii) Human Likeness, i.e., to what extent an automatic translation could have been generated by a human translator. Most approaches to automatic MT evaluation implicitly assume that both criteria should lead to the same results; but this assumption has not been proved empirically or even discussed.","In this work, we analyze this issue through empirical evidence. First, in Section 2, we investigate to what extent current evaluation metrics are able to distinguish between human and automatic translations (Human Likeness). As individual metrics do not capture such distinction well, in Section 3 we study how to improve the descriptive power of current metrics by means of metric combinations inside the QARLA Framework (Amigó et al., 2005), including a new family of metrics based on syntactic criteria. Second, we claim that the two evaluation criteria (Human Acceptability and Human Likeness) are indeed of a different nature, and may lead to different results (Section 4). However, translations exhibiting a high level of Human Likeness obtain good results in human judges. Therefore, automatic evaluation metrics based on similarity to references should be 17 optimized","over their capacity to represent Human Likeness. See conclusions in Section 5."]},{"title":"2 Descriptive Power of Standard Metrics","paragraphs":["In this section we perform a simple experiment in order to measure the descriptive power of current state-of-the-art metrics, i.e., their ability to capture the features which characterize human translations with respect to automatic ones. 2.1 Experimental Setting We use the data from the Openlab 2006 Initiative1 promoted by the TC-STAR Consortium2",". This test suite is entirely based on European Parliament Proceedings3",", covering April 1996 to May 2005. We focus on the Spanish-to-English translation task. For the purpose of evaluation we use the development set which consists of 1008 sentences. However, due to lack of available MT outputs for the whole set we used only a subset of 504 sentences corresponding to the first half of the development set. Three human references per sentence are available.","We employ ten system outputs; nine are based on Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems (Giménez and Màrquez, 2005; Crego et al., 2005), and one is obtained from the free Systran4","on-line rule-based MT engine. Evaluation results have been computed by means of the IQMT5","Framework for Automatic MT Evaluation (Giménez and Amigó, 2006).","We have selected a representative set of 22 metric variants corresponding to six different families: BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001), NIST (Doddington, 2002), GTM (Melamed et al., 2003), mPER (Leusch et al., 2003), mWER (Nießen et al., 2000) and ROUGE (Lin and Och, 2004a).","2.2 Measuring Descriptive Power of Evaluation Metrics Our main assumption is that if an evaluation metric is able to characterize human translations, then, human references should be closer to each other than automatic translations to other human references. Based on this assumption we introduce two measures (ORANGE and KING) which analyze 1 http://tc-star.itc.it/openlab2006/ 2 http://www.tc-star.org/ 3 http://www.europarl.eu.int/ 4 http://www.systransoft.com. 5 The IQMT Framework may be freely downloaded at","http://www.lsi.upc.edu/ñlp/IQMT. the descriptive power of evaluation metrics from diferent points of view. ORANGE Measure","ORANGE compares automatic and manual translations one-on-one. Let","and","be the sets of automatic and reference translations, respectively, and","an evaluation metric which outputs the quality of an automatic translation by comparison to",". ORANGE measures the descriptive power as the probability that a human reference","is more similar than an automatic translation","to the rest of human references: ","    ORANGE was introduced by Lin and Och (2004b)6","for the meta-evaluation of MT evaluation metrics. The ","","measure provides information about the average behavior of automatic and manual translations regarding an evaluation metric. KING Measure","However, ORANGE does not provide information about how many manual translations are discernible from automatic translations. The measure complements the ORANGE, tackling these two issues by universally quantifying on variable",":","   ","KING represents the probability that, for a given evaluation metric, a human reference is more similar to the rest of human references than any automatic translation 7",".","KING does not depend on the distribution of automatic translations, and identifies the cases for","6","They defined this measure as the average rank of the reference translations within the combined machine and reference translations list.","7","Originally KING is defined over the evaluation metric QUEEN, satisfying some restrictions which are not relevant in our context (Amigó et al., 2005). 18 which","the given metric has been able to discern human translations from automatic ones. That is, it measures how many manual translations can be used as gold-standard for system evaluation/improvement purposes. 2.3 Results Figure 1 shows the descriptive power, in terms of the ORANGE and KING measures, over the test set described in Subsection 2.1. Figure 1: ORANGE and KING values for standard metrics. Figure 2: ORANGE and KING behavior. ORANGE Results","All values of the ORANGE measure are lower than 0.5, which is the ORANGE value that a random metric would obtain (see central representa-tion in Figure 2). This is a rather counterintuitive result. A reasonable explanation, however, is that automatic translations behave as centroids with respect to human translations, because they somewhat average the vocabulary distribution in the manual references; as a result, automatic translations are closer to each manual summary than manual summaries to each other (see leftmost representation in Figure 2).","In other words, automatic translations tend to share (lexical) features with most of the references, but not to match exactly any of them. This is a combined effect of:"," The nature of MT systems, mostly statistical, which compute their estimates based on the number of occurrences of words, tend-ing to rely more on events that occur more often. Consequently, automatic translations typically consist of frequent words, which are likely to appear in most of the references."," The shallowness of current metrics, which are not able to identify the common properties of manual translations with regard to automatic translations. KING Results","KING values, on the other hand, are slightly higher than the value that a random metric would obtain (","","","). This means that every standard metric is able to discriminate a certain number of manual translations from the set of automatic translations; for instance, GTM-3 identifies 19% of the manual references. For the remain-ing 81% of the test cases, however, GTM-3 cannot make the distinction, and therefore cannot be used to detect and improve weaknesses of the automatic MT systems.","These results provide an explanation for the low correlation between automatic evaluation metrics and human judgements at the sentence level. The necessary conclusion is that new metrics with higher descriptive power are required."]},{"title":"3 Improving Descriptive Power","paragraphs":["The design of a metric that is able to capture all the linguistic aspects that distinguish human translations from automatic ones is a difficult path to trace. We approach this challenge by following a ‘divide and conquer’ strategy. We suggest to build a set of specialized similarity metrics devoted to the evaluation of partial aspects of MT quality. The challenge is then how to combine a set of similarity metrics into a single evaluation measure of 19 MT ","quality. The QARLA framework provides a solution for this challenge.","3.1 Similarity Metric Combinations inside QARLA The QARLA Framework permits to combine several similarity metrics into a single quality measure (QUEEN). Besides considering the similarity of automatic translations to human references, the QUEEN measure additionally considers the distribution of similarities among human references.","The QUEEN measure operates under the assumption that a good translation must be similar to human references (",") according to all similarity metrics. QUEEN","is defined as the probability, over",", that for every metric","in a given metric set","the automatic translation","is more similar to a human reference than two other references to each other:","QUEEN  "," ","where","is the automatic translation being eval-","uated,","","","","","are three different human refer-","ences in",", and","stands for the similarity of","","to .","In the case of Openlab data, we can count only","on three human references per sentence. In order","to increase the number of samples for QUEEN es-","timation we can use reference similarities","","","","","","between manual translation pairs from other sen-","tences, assuming that the distances between man-","ual references are relatively stable across exam-","ples. 3.2 Similarity Metrics We begin by defining a set of 22 similarity metrics taken from the list of standard evaluation metrics in Subsection 2.1. Evaluation metrics can be tuned into similarity metrics simply by considering only one reference when computing its value.","Secondly, we explore the possibility of design-ing complementary similarity metrics that exploit linguistic information at levels further than lexical. Inspired in the work by Liu and Gildea (2005), who introduced a series of metrics based on constituent/dependency syntactic matching, we have designed three subgroups of syntactic similarity metrics. To compute them, we have used the dependency trees provided by the MINIPAR dependency parser (Lin, 1998). These metrics compute the level of word overlapping (unigram precision/recall) between dependency trees associated to automatic and reference translations, from three different points of view:","TREE-X overlapping between the words hanging from non-terminal nodes of type","of the tree. For instance, the metric TREE PRED reflects the proportion of word overlapping between subtrees of type ‘pred’ (predicate of a clause).","GRAM-X overlapping between the words with the grammatical category",". For instance, the metric GRAM A reflects the proportion of word overlapping between terminal nodes of type ‘A’ (Adjective/Adverbs).","LEVEL-X overlapping between the words hanging at a certain level","of the tree, or deeper. For instance, LEVEL-1 would consider overlapping between all the words in the sentences.","In addition, we also consider three coarser metrics, namely TREE, GRAM and LEVEL, which correspond to the average value of the finer metrics corresponding to each subfamily. 3.3 Metric Set Selection We can compute KING over combinations of metrics by directly replacing the similarity metric","with the QUEEN measure. This corresponds exactly to the KING measure used in QARLA:","KING  ","  ","QUEEN","","","QUEEN","","","KING represents the probability that, for a given set of human references",", and a set of metrics",", the QUEEN quality of a human reference is greater than the QUEEN quality of any automatic translation in",".","The similarity metrics based on standard evaluation measures together with the two new families of similarity metrics form a set of 104 metrics. Our goal is to obtain the subset of metrics with highest descriptive power; for this, we rely on the KING probability. A brute force exploration of all possible metric combinations is not viable. In order to 20 perform","an approximate search for a local maximum in KING over all the possible metric combinations defined by",", we have used the following greedy heuristic:","1. Individual metrics are ranked by their KING value.","2. In decreasing rank order, metrics are individually added to the set of optimal metrics if, and only if, the global KING is increased.","After applying the algorithm we have obtained the optimal metric set:","GTM-1, NIST-2, GRAM A, GRAM N, GRAM AUX, GRAM BE, TREE, TREE AUX, TREE PNMOD, TREE PRED, TREE REL, TREE S and TREE WHN","which has a KING value of 0.29. This is significantly higher than the maximum KING obtained by any individual standard metric (which was 0.19 for GTM-3).","As to the probability ORANGE that a reference translation attains a higher score than an automatic translation, this metric set obtains a value of 0.49 vs. 0.42. This means that still the metrics are, on average, unable to discriminate between human references and automatic translations. However, the proportion of sentences for which the metrics are able to discriminate (KING value) is significantly higher.","The metric set with highest descriptive power contains metrics at different linguistic levels. For instance, GTM-1 and NIST-2 reward n-gram matches at the lexical level. GRAM A, GRAM N, GRAM AUX and GRAM BE capture word overlapping for nouns, auxiliary verbs, adjectives and adverbs, and auxiliary uses of the verb ‘to be’, respectively. TREE, TREE AUX, TREE PNMOD, TREE PRED, TREE REL, TREE S and TREE WHN reward lexical overlapping over different types of dependency subtrees: surface subjects, relative clauses, predicates, auxiliary verbs, postnominal modifiers, and whn-elements at C-spec positions, respectively.","These results are a clear indication that features from several linguistic levels are useful for the characterization of human translations."]},{"title":"4 Human-like vs. Human Acceptable","paragraphs":["In this section we analyze the relationship between the two different kinds of MT evaluation presented: (i) the ability of MT systems to generate human-like translations, and (ii) the ability of MT systems to generate translations that look acceptable to human judges. 4.1 Experimental Setting The ideal test set to study this dichotomy inside the QARLA Framework would consist of a large number of human references per sentence, and automatic outputs generated by heterogeneous MT systems.","4.2 Descriptive Power vs. Correlation with Human Judgements We use the data and results from the IWSLT04 Evaluation Campaign8",". We focus on the evaluation of the Chinese-to-English (CE) translation task, in which a set of 500 short sentences from the Basic Travel Expressions Corpus (BTEC) were translated (Akiba et al., 2004). For purposes of automatic evaluation, 16 reference translations and outputs by 20 different MT systems are available for each sentence. Moreover, each of these outputs was evaluated by three judges on the basis of adequacy and fluency (LDC, 2002). In our experiments we consider the sum of adequacy and fluency assessments.","However, the BTEC corpus has a serious drawback: sentences are very short (8 word length in average). In order to consider a sentence adequate we are practically forcing it to match exactly some of the human references. To alleviate this effect we selected sentences consisting of at least ten words. A total of 94 sentences (of 13 words length in average) satisfied this constraint.","Figure 3 shows, for all metrics, the relationship between the power of characterization of human references (KING, horizontal axis) and the correlation with human judgements (Pearson correlation, vertical axis). Data are plotted in three different groups: original standard metrics, single metrics inside QARLA (QUEEN measure), and the optimal metric combination according to KING. The optimal set is: ","GRAM N, LEVEL 2, LEVEL 4, NIST-1, NIST-3, NIST-4, and 1-WER","This set suggests that all kinds of n-grams play an important role in the characterization of human 8 http://www.slt.atr.co.jp/IWSLT2004/ 21 translations. ","The metric GRAM N reflects the importance of noun translations. Unlike the Openlab corpus, levels of the dependency tree (LEVEL 2 and LEVEL 4) are descriptive features, but dependency relations are not (TREE metrics). This is probably due to the small average sentence length in IWSLT.","Metrics exhibiting a high level of correlation outside QARLA, such as NIST-3, also exhibit a high descriptive power (KING). There is also a tendency for metrics with a KING value around 0.6 to concentrate at a level of Pearson correlation around 0.5.","But the main point is the fact that the QUEEN measure obtained by the metric combination with highest KING does not yield the highest level of correlation with human assessments, which is obtained by standard metrics outside QARLA (0.5 vs. 0.7). Figure 3: Human characterization vs. correlation with human judgements for IWSLT’04 CE translation task. Figure 4: QUEEN values vs. human judgements for IWSLT’04 CE translation task.","4.3 Human Judgements vs. Similarity to References In order to explain the above results, we have analyzed the relationship between human assessments and the QUEEN values obtained by the best combination of metrics for every individual translation.","Figure 4 shows that high values of QUEEN (i.e., similarity to references) imply high values of human judgements. But the reverse is not true. There are translations acceptable to a human judge but not similar to human translations according to QUEEN. This fact can be understood by in-specting a few particular cases. Table 1 shows two cases of translations exhibiting a very low QUEEN value and very high human judgment score. The two cases present the same kind of problem: there exists some word or phrase absent from all human references. In the first example, the automatic translation uses the expression “seats” to make a reservation, where humans in-variably choose “table”. In the second example, the automatic translation users “rack” as the place to put a bag, while humans choose “overhead bin”, “overhead compartment”, but never “rack”.","Therefore, the QUEEN measure discriminates these automatic translations regarding to all human references, thus assigning them a low value. However, human judges find the translation still acceptable and informative, although not strictly human-like.","These results suggest that inside the set of human acceptable translations, which includes human-like translations, there is also a subset of translations unlikely to have been produced by a human translator. This is a drawback of MT evaluation based on human references when the evaluation criteria is Human Acceptability. The good news are that when Human Likeness increases, Human Acceptability increases as well."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have analyzed the ability of current MT evaluation metrics to characterize human translations (as opposed to automatic translations), and the relationship between MT evaluation based on Human Acceptability and Human Likeness.","The first conclusion is that, over a limited number of references, standard metrics are unable to identify the features that characterize human translations. Instead, systems behave as centroids with 22 respect","to human references. This is due, among other reasons, to the combined effect of the shallowness of current MT evaluation metrics (mostly lexical), and the fact that the choice of lexical items is mostly based on statistical methods. We suggest two complementary ways of solving this problem. First, we introduce a new family of syntax-based metrics covering partial aspects of MT quality. Second, we use the QARLA Framework to combine multiple metrics into a single measure of quality. In the future we will study the design of new metrics working at different linguistic levels. For instance, we are currently developing a new family of metrics based on shallow parsing (i.e., part-of-speech, lemma, and chunk information).","Second, our results suggest that there exists a clear relation between the two kinds of MT evaluation described. While Human Likeness is a sufficient condition to get Human Acceptability, Human Acceptability does not guarantee Human Likeness. Human judges may consider acceptable automatic translations that would never be generated by a human translator.","Considering these results, we claim that improving metrics according to their descriptive power (Human Likeness) is more reliable than improving metrics based on correlation with human judges. First, because this correlation is not granted, since automatic metrics are based on similarity to models. Second, because high Human Likeness ensures high scores from human judges."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Yasuhiro Akiba, Marcello Federico, Noriko Kando, Hiromi Nakaiwa, Michael Paul, and Jun’ichi Tsujii. 2004.
