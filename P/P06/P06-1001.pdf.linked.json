It only requires consistency between training and testing. As a result, there is a wide range of possible preprocessing choices for data used in SMT. This is even more so for morphologically rich languages such as Arabic. We use the term “preprocessing” to describe various input modifications applied to raw training and testing texts for SMT. Preprocessing includes different kinds of tokenization, stemming, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and lemmatization. The ultimate goal of preprocessing is to improve the quality of the SMT output by addressing issues such as sparsity in training data. We refer to a specifickind of preprocessing as a “scheme” and differentiate it from the “technique” used to obtain it. In a previous publication, we presented results describing six preprocessing schemes for Arabic (Habash and Sadat, 2006). These schemes were evaluated against three different techniques that vary in linguistic complexity; and across a learning curve of training sizes. Additionally, we reported on the effect of scheme/technique combination on genre variation between training and testing.","In this paper, we shift our attention to exploring and contrasting additional preprocessing schemes for Arabic and describing and evaluating different methods for combining them. We use a single technique throughout the experiments reported here. We show an improved MT performance when combining different schemes.","Similarly to Habash and Sadat (2006), the set of schemes we explore are all word-level. As such, we do not utilize any syntactic information. We define the word to be limited to written Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) strings separated by white space, punctuation and numbers.","Section 2 presents previous relevant research. Section 3 presents some relevant background on Arabic linguistics to motivate the schemes discussed in Section 4. Section 5 presents the tools and data sets used, along with the results of basic scheme experiments. Section 6 presents combination techniques and their results."]},{"title":"2 Previous Work","paragraphs":["The anecdotal intuition in the field is that reduction of word sparsity often improves translation quality. This reduction can be achieved by increas-ing training data or via morphologically driven preprocessing (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005). Recent publications on the effect of morphology on SMT quality focused on morphologically rich languages such as German (Nießen and Ney, 2004); Spanish, Catalan, and Serbian (Popović 1 and Ney, 2004); and Czech (Goldwater and Mc-Closky, 2005). They all studied the effects of various kinds of tokenization, lemmatization and POS tagging and show a positive effect on SMT quality.","Specifically considering Arabic, Lee (2004) in-vestigated the use of automatic alignment of POS tagged English and affix-stem segmented Arabic to determine appropriate tokenizations. Her results show that morphological preprocessing helps, but only for the smaller corpora. As size increases, the benefits diminish. Our results are comparable to hers in terms of BLEU score and consistent in terms of conclusions. Other research on preprocessing Arabic suggests that minimal preprocessing, such as splitting off the conjunction +","w+ ’and’, produces best results with very large training data (Och, 2005).","System combination for MT has also been in-vestigated by different researchers. Approaches to combination generally either select one of the hypotheses produced by the different systems combined (Nomoto, 2004; Paul et al., 2005; Lee, 2005) or combine lattices/n-best lists from the different systems with different degrees of synthesis or mixing (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994; Bangalore et al., 2001; Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Matusov et al., 2006). These different approaches use various translation and language models in addition to other models such as word matching, sentence and document alignment, system translation confidence,phrase translation lexicons, etc.","We extend on previous work by experimenting with a wider range of preprocessing schemes for Arabic and exploring their combination to produce better results."]},{"title":"3 Arabic Linguistic Issues","paragraphs":["Arabic is a morphologically complex language with a large set of morphological features1",". These features are realized using both concatenative morphology (affixes and stems) and templatic morphology (root and patterns). There is a variety of morphological and phonological adjustments that appear in word orthography and interact with orthographic variations. Next we discuss a subset of these issues that are necessary background for the later sections. We do not address","1","Arabic words have fourteen morphological features: POS, person, number, gender, voice, aspect, determiner proclitic, conjunctive proclitic, particle proclitic, pronominal enclitic, nominal case, nunation, idafa (possessed), and mood. derivational morphology (such as using roots as tokens) in this paper.","","Orthographic Ambiguity: The form of certain letters in Arabic script allows suboptimal orthographic variants of the same word to coexist in the same text. For example, variants of Hamzated Alif, ","or","are often written without their Hamza (","):","A. These variant spellings increase the ambiguity of words. The Arabic script employs diacritics for representing short vowels and doubled consonants. These diacritics are almost always absent in running text, which increases word ambiguity. We assume all of the text we are using is undiacritized.","","Clitics: Arabic has a set of attachable clitics to be distinguished from inflectional features such as gender, number, person, voice, aspect, etc. These clitics are written attached to the word and thus increase the ambiguity of alternative readings. We can classify three degrees of cliticization that are applicable to a word base in a strict order:","[CONJ+ [PART+ [Al+ BASE +PRON]]]","At the deepest level, the BASE can have a definite article (+","Al+ ‘the’) or a member of the class of pronominal enclitics, +PRON, (e.g.","+ +hm ‘their/them’). Pronominal enclitics can attach to nouns (as possessives) or verbs and prepositions (as objects). The definite article doesn’t apply to verbs or prepositions. +PRON and Al+ cannot co-exist on nouns. Next comes the class of particle proclitics (PART+): +","l+ ‘to/for’, +","b+ ‘by/with’, +","k+ ‘as/such’ and +","s+ ‘will/future’. b+ and k+ are only nominal; s+ is only verbal and l+ applies to both nouns and verbs. At the shallowest level of attachment we find the conjunctions (CONJ+) +","w+ ‘and’ and +","f+ ‘so’. They can attach to everything.","","Adjustment Rules: Morphological features that are realized concatenatively (as opposed to templatically) are not always simply concatenated to a word base. Additional morphological, phonological and orthographic rules are applied to the word. An example of a morphological rule is the feminine morpheme,","+p (ta marbuta), which can only be word final. In medial position, it is turned into","t. For example,","+","mktbp+hm appears as","mktbthm ‘their library’. An example of an orthographic rule is the deletion of the Alif (",") of the definitearticle +","Al+ in nouns when preceded by the preposition +","l+ ‘to/for’ but not with any other prepositional proclitic. 2","","Templatic Inflections : Some of the inflectional features in Arabic words are realized templatically by applying a different pattern to the Arabic root. As a result, extracting the lexeme (or lemma) of an Arabic word is not always an easy task and often requires the use of a morphological analyzer. One common example in Arabic nouns is Broken Plurals. For example, one of the plural forms of the Arabic word   kAtb ‘writer’","is  ","ktbp ‘writers’. An alternative non-broken","plural (concatenatively derived) is","","   kAtbwn ‘writers’.","These phenomena highlight two issues related to the task at hand (preprocessing): First, ambiguity in Arabic words is an important issue to address. To determine whether a clitic or feature should be split off or abstracted off requires that we determine that said feature is indeed present in the word we are considering in context – not just that it is possible given an analyzer. Secondly, once a specific analysis is determined, the process of splitting off or abstracting off a feature must be clear on what the form of the resulting word should be. In principle, we would like to have whatever adjustments now made irrelevant (because of the missing feature) to be removed. This ensures reduced sparsity and reduced unnecessary ambiguity. For example, the word  ktbthm has two possible readings (among others) as ‘their writers’ or ‘I wrote them’. Splitting off the pronominal enclitic","+ +hm without normalizing the","t to","p in the nominal reading leads the coexistence of two forms of the noun","  ktbp","and  ","ktbt. This increased sparsity is only worsened by the fact that the second form is also the verbal form (thus increased ambiguity)."]},{"title":"4 Arabic Preprocessing Schemes","paragraphs":["Given Arabic morphological complexity, the number of possible preprocessing schemes is very large since any subset of morphological and orthographic features can be separated, deleted or normalized in various ways. To implement any preprocessing scheme, a preprocessing technique must be able to disambiguate amongst the possible analyses of a word, identify the features addressed by the scheme in the chosen analysis and process them as specified by the scheme. In this section we describe eleven different schemes. 4.1 Preprocessing Technique We use the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (BAMA) (Buckwalter, 2002) to obtain possible word analyses. To select among these analyses, we use the Morphological Analysis and Disambiguation for Arabic (MADA) tool,2","an off-the-shelf resource for Arabic disambiguation (Habash and Rambow, 2005). Being a disambiguation system of morphology, not word sense, MADA some-times produces ties for analyses with the same inflectional features but different lexemes (resolving such ties require word-sense disambiguation). We resolve these ties in a consistent arbitrary manner: firstin a sorted list of analyses.","Producing a preprocessing scheme involves removing features from the word analysis and regenerating the word without the split-off features. The regeneration ensures that the generated form is appropriately normalized by addressing various morphotactics described in Section 3. The generation is completed using the off-the-shelf Arabic morphological generation system Aragen (Habash, 2004).","This preprocessing technique we use here is the best performer amongst other explored techniques presented in Habash and Sadat (2006). 4.2 Preprocessing Schemes Table 1 exemplifiesthe effect of different schemes on the same sentence.","","ST: Simple Tokenization is the baseline preprocessing scheme. It is limited to splitting off punctuations and numbers from words. For example the last non-white-space string in the example sentence in Table 1, “trk yA.” is split into two tokens: “trk yA” and “. ”. An example of splitting numbers from words is the case of the conjunction +","w+ ‘and’ which can prefixnumerals such as when a list of numbers is described: 15","w15 ‘and 15’. This scheme requires no disambiguation. Any diacritics that appear in the input are removed in this scheme. This scheme is used as input to produce the other schemes.","","ON: Orthographic Normalization addresses the issue of sub-optimal spelling in Arabic. We use the Buckwalter answer undiacritized as the or-thographically normalized form. An example of ON is the spelling of the last letter in the firstand 2","The version of MADA used in this paper was trained on the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) part 1 (Maamouri et al., 2004). 3","Table 1: Various Preprocessing Schemes","Input wsynhY Alr ys jwlth bzyArp AlY trkyA.","Gloss and will finish the president tour his with visit to Turkey .","English The president will finish his tour with a visit to Turkey.","Scheme Baseline","ST wsynhY Alr ys jwlth bzyArp AlY trkyA .","ON wsynhy Alr ys jwlth bzyArp","lY trkyA .","D1 w+ synhy Alr ys jwlth bzyArp","lY trkyA .","D2 w+ s+ ynhy Alr ys jwlth b+ zyArp","lY trkyA .","D3 w+ s+ ynhy Al+ r ys jwlp +P","b+ zyArp","lY trkyA .","WA w+ synhy Alr ys jwlth bzyArp","lY trkyA .","TB w+ synhy Alr ys jwlp +P","b+ zyArp","lY trkyA .","MR w+ s+ y+ nhy Al+ r ys jwl +p +h b+ zyAr +p","lY trkyA .","L1","nhY","r","ys","jwlp","zyArp","","lY","trkyA",".","L2","nhY","r","ys","jwlp","zyArp","","lY","","trkyA",".","EN w+ s+","nhY","+S","Al+ r ys","jwlp","+P","b+ zyArp","","lY","","trkyA",". fifthwords in the example in Table 1 (wsynhY and AlY, respectively). Since orthographic normaliza-tion is tied to the use of MADA and BAMA, all of the schemes we use here are normalized.","","D1, D2, and D3: Decliticization (degree 1, 2 and 3) are schemes that split off clitics in the order described in Section 3. D1 splits off the class of conjunction clitics (w+ and f+). D2 is the same as D1 plus splitting off the class of particles (l+, k+, b+ and s+). Finally D3 splits off what D2 does in addition to the definite article Al+ and all pronominal enclitics. A pronominal clitic is represented as its feature representation to preserve its uniqueness. (See the third word in the example in Table 1.) This allows distinguishing between the possessive pronoun and object pronoun which often look similar.","","WA: Decliticizing the conjunction w+. This is the simplest tokenization used beyond ON. It is similar to D1, but without including f+. This is included to compare to evidence in its support as best preprocessing scheme for very large data (Och, 2005).","","TB: Arabic Treebank Tokenization. This is the same tokenization scheme used in the Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et al., 2004). This is similar to D3 but without the splitting off of the definite article Al+ or the future particle s+.","","MR: Morphemes. This scheme breaks up words into stem and affixival morphemes. It is identical to the initial tokenization used by Lee (2004).","","L1 and L2: Lexeme and POS. These reduce a word to its lexeme and a POS. L1 and L2 differ in the set of POS tags they use. L1 uses the simple POS tags advocated by Habash and Rambow (2005) (15 tags); while L2 uses the reduced tag set used by Diab et al. (2004) (24 tags). The latter is modeled after the English Penn POS tag set. For example, Arabic nouns are differentiated for being singular (NN) or Plural/Dual (NNS), but adjectives are not even though, in Arabic, they in-flect exactly the same way nouns do.","","EN: English-like. This scheme is intended to minimize differences between Arabic and English. It decliticizes similarly to D3, but uses Lexeme and POS tags instead of the regenerated word. The POS tag set used is the reduced Arabic Treebank tag set (24 tags) (Maamouri et al., 2004; Diab et al., 2004). Additionally, the subject inflection is indicated explicitly as a separate token. We do not use any additional information to remove specific features using alignments or syntax (unlike, e.g. removing all but one Al+ in noun phrases (Lee, 2004)). 4.3 Comparing Various Schemes Table 2 compares the different schemes in terms of the number of tokens, number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens, and perplexity. These statistics are computed over the MT04 set, which we use in this paper to report SMT results (Section 5). Perplexity is measured against a language model constructed from the Arabic side of the parallel corpus used in the MT experiments (Section 5).","Obviously the more verbose a scheme is, the bigger the number of tokens in the text. The ST, ON, L1, and L2 share the same number of tokens because they all modify the word without splitting off any of its morphemes or features. The increase in the number of tokens is in inverse correlation 4","Table 2: Scheme Statistics Scheme Tokens OOVs Perplexity ST 36000 1345 1164 ON 36000 1212 944 D1 38817 1016 582 D2 40934 835 422 D3 52085 575 137 WA 38635 1044 596 TB 42880 662 338 MR 62410 409 69 L1 36000 392 401 L2 36000 432 460 EN 55525 432 103 with the number of OOVs and perplexity. The only exceptions are L1 and L2, whose low OOV rate is the result of the reductionist nature of the scheme, which does not preserve morphological information."]},{"title":"5 Basic Scheme Experiments","paragraphs":["We now describe the system and the data sets we used to conduct our experiments. 5.1 Portage We use an off-the-shelf phrase-based SMT system, Portage (Sadat et al., 2005). For training, Portage uses IBM word alignment models (models 1 and 2) trained in both directions to extract phrase tables in a manner resembling (Koehn, 2004a). Trigram language models are implemented using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002). Decoding weights are optimized using Och’s algorithm (Och, 2003) to set weights for the four components of the log-linear model: language model, phrase translation model, distortion model, and word-length feature. The weights are optimized over the BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2001). The Portage decoder, Canoe, is a dynamic-programming beam search algorithm resembling the algorithm described in (Koehn, 2004a). 5.2 Experimental data All of the training data we use is available from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). We use an Arabic-English parallel corpus of about 5 million words for translation model training data.3 We created the English language model from the English side of the parallel corpus together 3","The parallel text includes Arabic News (LDC2004T17), eTIRR (LDC2004E72), English translation of Arabic Treebank (LDC2005E46), and Ummah (LDC2004T18). with 116 million words the English Gigaword Corpus (LDC2005T12) and 128 million words from the English side of the UN Parallel corpus (LDC2004E13).4","English preprocessing simply included lowercasing, separating punctuation from words and splitting off “’ s”. The same preprocessing was used on the English data for all experiments. Only Arabic preprocessing was varied. Decoding weight optimization was done using a set of 200 sentences from the 2003 NIST MT evaluation test set (MT03). We report results on the 2004 NIST MT evaluation test set (MT04) The experiment design and choices of schemes and techniques were done independently of the test set. The data sets, MT03 and MT04, include one Arabic source and four English reference translations. We use the evaluation metric BLEU-4 (Papineni et al., 2001) although we are aware of its caveats (Callison-Burch et al., 2006). 5.3 Experimental Results We conducted experiments with all schemes discussed in Section 4 with different training corpus sizes: 1%, 10%, 50% and 100%. The results of the experiments are summarized in Table 3. These results are not English case sensitive. All reported scores must have over 1.1% BLEU-4 difference to be significant at the 95% confidence level for 1% training. For all other training sizes, the difference must be over 1.7% BLEU-4. Error in-tervals were computed using bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004b).","Across different schemes, EN performs the best under scarce-resource condition; and D2 performs as best under large resource conditions. The results from the learning curve are consistent with previous published work on using morphological preprocessing for SMT: deeper morph analysis helps for small data sets, but the effect is diminished with more data. One interesting observation is that for our best performing system (D2), the BLEU score at 50% training (35.91) was higher than the baseline ST at 100% training data (34.59). This relationship is not consistent across the rest of the experiments. ON improves over the baseline","4","The SRILM toolkit has a limit on the size of the training corpus. We selected portions of additional corpora using a heuristic that picks documents containing the word “Arab” only. The Language model created using this heuristic had a bigger improvement in BLEU score (more than 1% BLEU-4) than a randomly selected portion of equal size. 5","Table 3: Scheme Experiment Results (BLEU-4)","Training Data Scheme 1% 10% 50% 100% ST 9.42 22.92 31.09 34.59 ON 10.71 24.3 32.52 35.91 D1 13.11 26.88 33.38 36.06 D2 14.19 27.72 35.91 37.10 D3 16.51 28.69 34.04 34.33 WA 13.12 26.29 34.24 35.97 TB 14.13 28.71 35.83 36.76 MR 11.61 27.49 32.99 34.43 L1 14.63 24.72 31.04 32.23 L2 14.87 26.72 31.28 33.00 EN 17.45 28.41 33.28 34.51 but only statistically significantly at the 1% level.

The TB scheme behaves similarly to D2, the best scheme we have. It outperformed D2 in few instances, but the difference were not statistically significant. L1 and L2 behaved similar to EN across the different training size. However, both were always worse than EN. Neither variant was consistently better than the other."]},{"title":"6 System Combination","paragraphs":["The complementary variation in the behavior of different schemes under different resource size conditions motivated us to investigate system combination. The intuition is that even under large resource conditions, some words will occur very infrequently that the only way to model them is to use a technique that behaves well under poor resource conditions.","We conducted an oracle study into system combination. An oracle combination output was created by selecting for each input sentence the output with the highest sentence-level BLEU score. We recognize that since the brevity penalty in BLEU is applied globally, this score may not be the highest possible combination score. The oracle combination has a 24% improvement in BLEU score (from 37.1 in best system to 46.0) when combining all eleven schemes described in this paper. This shows that combining of output from all schemes has a large potential of improvement over all of the different systems and that the different schemes are complementary in some way.","In the rest of this section we describe two successful methods for system combination of different schemes: rescoring-only combination (ROC) and decoding-plus-rescoring combination (DRC). All of the experiments use the same training data, test data (MT04) and preprocessing schemes described in the previous section. 6.1 Rescoring-only Combination This “shallo w” approach rescores all the one-best outputs generated from separate scheme-specific systems and returns the top choice. Each scheme-specific system uses its own scheme-specific preprocessing, phrase-tables, and decoding weights. For rescoring, we use the following features:"," The four basic features used by the decoder: trigram language model, phrase translation model, distortion model, and word-length feature."," IBM model 1 and IBM model 2 probabilities in both directions. We call the union of these two sets of features standard."," The perplexity of the preprocessed source sentence (PPL) against a source language model as described in Section 4.3."," The number of out-of-vocabulary words in the preprocessed source sentence (OOV)."," Length of the preprocessed source sentence (SL)."," An encoding of the specific scheme used (SC). We use a one-hot coding approach with 11 separate binary features, each correspond-ing to a specificscheme.","Optimization of the weights on the rescoring features is carried out using the same max-BLEU algorithm and the same development corpus described in Section 5.","Results of different sets of features with the ROC approach are presented in Table 4. Using standard features with all eleven schemes, we obtain a BLEU score of 34.87 – a significant drop from the best scheme system (D2, 37.10). Using different subsets of features or limiting the number of systems to the best four systems (D2, TB, D1 and WA), we get some improvements. The best results are obtained using all schemes with standard features plus perplexity and scheme coding. The improvements are small; however they are statistically significant(see Section 6.3). 6","Table 4: ROC Approach Results Combination All Schemes 4 Best Schemes standard 34.87 37.12 +PPL+SC 37.58 37.45 +PPL+SC+OOV 37.40 +PPL+SC+OOV+SL 37.39 +PPL+SC+SL 37.15 6.2 Decoding-plus-Rescoring Combination This “deep” approach allows the decoder to consult several different phrase tables, each generated using a different preprocessing scheme; just as with ROC, there is a subsequent rescoring stage. A problem with DRC is that the decoder we use can only cope with one format for the source sentence at a time. Thus, we are forced to designate a particular scheme as privileged when the system is carrying out decoding. The privileged preprocessing scheme will be the one applied to the source sentence. Obviously, words and phrases in the preprocessed source sentence will more frequently match the phrases in the privileged phrase table than in the non-privileged ones. Nevertheless, the decoder may still benefitfrom having access to all the tables. For each choice of a privileged scheme, optimization of log-linear weights is carried out (with the version of the development set preprocessed in the same privileged scheme).","The middle column of Table 5 shows the results for 1-best output from the decoder under different choices of the privileged scheme. The best-performing system in this column has as its privileged preprocessing scheme TB. The decoder for this system uses TB to preprocess the source sentence, but has access to a log-linear combination of information from all 11 preprocessing schemes.","The final column of Table 5 shows the results of rescoring the concatenation of the 1-best outputs from each of the combined systems. The rescoring features used are the same as those used for the ROC experiments. For rescoring, a privileged preprocessing scheme is chosen and applied to the development corpus. We chose TB for this (since it yielded the best result when chosen to be privileged at the decoding stage). Applied to 11 schemes, this yields the best result so far: 38.67 BLEU. Combining the 4 best pre-processing schemes (D2, TB, D1, WA) yielded a lower BLEU score (37.73).
