It computes the probability of producing a given word w1 given all the words that precede it in the sentence. An n-gram language model is an n-th order Markov model where the probability of generating a given word depends only on the last n 1 words immediately preceding it and is given by the following equation:","P (wk 1 ) = P (w1)P (w2jw1) P (wnjwn−1","1 ) (1)","where k >= n.","N -gram language models have been successfully used in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) as was firstproposed by (Bahl et al., 1983). They play an important role in selecting among several candidate word realization of a given acoustic signal. N -gram language models have also been used in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) as proposed by (Brown et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1993). The run-time search procedure used to findthe most likely translation (or transcription in the case of Speech Recognition) is typically referred to as decoding.","There is a fundamental difference between decoding for machine translation and decoding for speech recognition. When decoding a speech signal, words are generated in the same order in which their corresponding acoustic signal is consumed. However, that is not necessarily the case in MT due to the fact that different languages have different word order requirements. For example, in Spanish and Arabic adjectives are mainly noun post-modifiers,whereas in English adjectives are noun pre-modifiers. Therefore, when translating between Spanish and English, words must usually be reordered.","Existing statistical machine translation decoders have mostly relied on language models to select the proper word order among many possible choices when translating between two languages. In this paper, we argue that a language model is not sufficient to adequately address this issue, especially when translating between languages that have very different word orders as suggested by our experimental results in Section 5. We propose a new distortion model that can be used as an additional component in SMT decoders. This new model leads to significant improvements in MT quality as measured by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002). The experimental results we report in this paper are for Arabic-English machine translation of news stories.","We also present a novel method for measuring word order similarity (or differences) between any given pair of languages based on word alignments as described in Section 3.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of related work. In Section 3 we propose a method for measuring the distortion between any given pair of languages. In Section 4, we present our proposed distortion model. In Section 5, we present some empirical results that show the utility of our distortion model for statistical machine translation systems. Then, we conclude this paper with a discussion in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Different languages have different word order require-ments.

Trying all possible word reordering is an NP-Complete problem as shown in (Knight, 1999), which makes search-ing for the optimal solution among all possible permutations computationally intractable. Therefore, SMT decoders typically limit the number of permutations considered for efficiency reasons by placing reordering restrictions. Reordering restrictions for word-based SMT decoders were introduced by (Berger et al., 1996) and (Wu, 1996). (Berger et al., 1996) allow only reordering of at most n words at any given time. (Wu, 1996) propose using contiguity restrictions on the reordering. For a comparison and a more detailed discussion of the two approaches see (Zens and Ney, 2003).","A different approach to allow for a limited reordering is to reorder the input sentence such that the source and the target sentences have similar word order and then proceed to monotonically decode the reordered source sentence.","Monotone decoding translates words in the same order they appear in the source language. Hence, the input and output sentences have the same word order. Monotone decoding is very efficientsince the optimal decoding can be found in polynomial time. (Tillmann et al., 1997) proposed a DP-based monotone search algorithm for SMT. Their proposed solution to address the necessary word reordering is to rewrite the input sentence such that it has a similar word order to the desired target sentence. The paper suggests that reordering the input reduces the translation error rate. However, it does not provide a methodology on how to perform this reordering.","(Xia and McCord, 2004) propose a method to automatically acquire rewrite patterns that can be applied to any given input sentence so that the rewritten source and target sentences have similar word order. These rewrite patterns are automatically extracted by pars-ing the source and target sides of the training parallel corpus. Their approach show a statistically-significant improvement over a phrase-based monotone decoder. Their experiments also suggest that allowing the decoder to consider some word order permutations in addition to the rewrite patterns already applied to the source sentence actually decreases the BLEU score.","Rewriting the input sentence whether using syntactic rules or heuristics makes hard decisions that can not be undone by the decoder. Hence, reordering is better handled during the search algorithm and as part of the optimization function.","Phrase-based monotone decoding does not directly address word order issues. Indirectly, however, the phrase dictionary1","in phrase-based decoders typically captures local reorderings that were seen in the training data. However, it fails to generalize to word reorderings that were never seen in the training data. For example, a phrase-based decoder might translate the Ara-1 Also referred to in the literature as the set of blocks or","clumps. bic phrase AlwlAyAt AlmtHdp2","correctly into English as the United States if it was seen in its training data, was aligned correctly, and was added to the phrase dictionary. However, if the phrase Almmlkp AlmtHdp is not in the phrase dictionary, it will not be translated correctly by a monotone phrase decoder even if the in-dividual units of the phrase Almmlkp and AlmtHdp, and their translations (Kingdom and United, respectively) are in the phrase dictionary since that would require swapping the order of the two words.","(Och et al., 1999; Tillmann and Ney, 2003) relax the monotonicity restriction in their phrase-based decoder by allowing a restricted set of word reorderings. For their translation task, word reordering is done only for words belonging to the verb group. The context in which they report their results is a Speech-to-Speech translation from German to English.","(Yamada and Knight, 2002) propose a syntax-based decoder that restrict word reordering based on reordering operations on syntactic parse-trees of the input sentence. They reported results that are better than word-based IBM4-like decoder. However, their decoder is outperformed by phrase-based decoders such as (Koehn, 2004), (Och et al., 1999), and (Tillmann and Ney, 2003) . Phrase-based SMT decoders mostly rely on the language model to select among possible word order choices. However, in our experiments we show that the language model is not reliable enough to make the choices that lead to a better MT quality. This observation is also reported by (Xia and McCord, 2004).We argue that the distortion model we propose leads to a better translation as measured by BLEU.","Distortion models were firstproposed by (Brown et al., 1993) in the so-called IBM Models. IBM Models 2 and 3 definethe distortion parameters in terms of the word positions in the sentence pair, not the actual words at those positions. Distortion probability is also conditioned on the source and target sentence lengths. These models do not generalize well since their parameters are tied to absolute word position within sentences which tend to be different for the same words across sentences. IBM Models 4 and 5 alleviate this limita-tion by replacing absolute word positions with relative positions. The latter models define the distortion parameters for a cept (one or more words). This models phrasal movement better since words tend to move in blocks and not independently. The distortion is conditioned on classes of the aligned source and target words. The entire source and target vocabularies are reduced to a small number of classes (e.g., 50) for the purpose of estimating those parameters.","Similarly, (Koehn et al., 2003) propose a relative distortion model to be used with a phrase decoder. The model is definedin terms of the difference between the position of the current phrase and the position of the previous phrase in the source sentence.

Conditioning on the source words allows for a much more fine-grainedmodel. For instance, words that tend to act as modifers (e.g., adjectives) would have a different distribution than verbs or nouns. Our model’s parameters are directly estimated from word alignments as we will further explain in Section 4. We will also show how to generalize this word distortion model to a phrase-based model.","(Och et al., 2004; Tillman, 2004) propose orientation-based distortion models lexicalized on the phrase level. There are two important distinctions between their models and ours. First, they lexicalize their model on the phrases, which have many more parameters and hence would require much more data to estimate reliably. Second, their models consider only the direction (i.e., orientation) and not the relative jump.","We are not aware of any work on measuring word order differences between a given language pair in the context of statistical machine translation."]},{"title":"3 Measuring Word Order Similarity Between Two Language","paragraphs":["In this section, we propose a simple, novel method for measuring word order similarity (or differences) between any given language pair. This method is based on word-alignments and the BLEU metric.","We assume that we have word-alignments for a set of sentence pairs. We first reorder words in the target sentence (e.g., English when translating from Arabic to English) according to the order in which they are aligned to the source words as shown in Table 1. If a target word is not aligned, then, we assume that it is aligned to the same source word that the preceding aligned target word is aligned to.","Once the reordered target (here English) sentences are generated, we measure the distortion between the language pair by computing the BLEU3","score between the original target and reordered target, treating the original target as the reference.","Table 2 shows these scores for Arabic-English and","3","the BLEU scores reported throughout this paper are for case-sensitive BLEU.

The word alignments we use are both annotated manually by human annotators. The Arabic-English test set is the NIST MT Evaluation 2003 test set. It contains 663 segments (i.e., sentences). The Arabic side consists of 16,652 tokens and the English consists of 19,908 tokens. The Chinese-English test set contains 260 segments. The Chinese side is word segmented and consists of 4,319 tokens and the English consists of 5,525 tokens.","As suggested by the BLEU scores reported in Table 2, Arabic-English has more word order differences than Chinese-English. The difference in n-gPrec is bigger for smaller values of n, which suggests that Arabic-English has more local word order differences than in Chinese-English."]},{"title":"4 Proposed Distortion Model","paragraphs":["The distortion model we are proposing consists of three components: outbound, inbound, and pair distortion.

Do we tend to translate words that precede it or succeed it? Which word position to translate next?","Our distortion parameters are directly estimated from word alignments by simple counting over alignment links in the training data.

Therefore, we need to generalize the distortion cost in order to use it in a phrase-based decoder. This generalization is definedin terms of the internal word alignment within phrases (we used the Viterbi word alignment). We illustrate this with an example: Suppose the last position translated in the source sentence so far is n and we are to cover a source phrase p=wlAyp wA$nTn that begins at position m in the source sentence. Also, suppose that our phrase dictionary provided the translation Washington State, with internal word alignment a = (a1 = 2, a2 = 1) (i.e., a=(<Washington,wA$nTn>, <State,wlAyp>), then the outbound phrase cost is definedas:","Co(p, n, m, a) =Co(δ = (m n)jfn)+ l−1 ∑ i=1 Co(δ = (ai+1 ai) jfai) (6)","where l is the length of the target phrase, a is the internal word alignment, fn is source word at position n (in the sentence), and fai is the source word that is aligned to the i-th word in the target side of the phrase (not the sentence).","The inbound and pair distortion costs (i..e, Ci(p, n, m, a) and Cp(p, n, m, a)) can be defined in a similar fashion.","The above distortion costs are used in conjunction with other cost components used in our decoder.

The beam search algorithm attempts to findthe translation (i.e., hypothesis that covers all source words) with the minimum cost as in (Tillmann and Ney, 2003) and (Koehn, 2004) . The distortion cost is added to the log-linear mixture of the hypothesis extension in a fashion similar to the language model cost.","A hypothesis covers a subset of the source words.

The cost of the new hypothesis C(hnew) = C(h) + C(e), where C(e) is the cost of this extension. The main components of the cost of extension e can be definedby the following equation: C(e) = λ1CLM (e) + λ2CT M (e) + λ3CD(e)","where CLM (e) is the language model cost, CT M (e) is the translation model cost, and CD(e) is the distortion cost.

The second parameter is the window width w, which is definedas the distance (in number of source words) between the left-most uncovered source word and the right-most covered source word.","To illustrate these restrictions, let us assume the input sentence consists of the following sequence (f1, f2, f3, f4).
