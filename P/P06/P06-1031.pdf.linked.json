To be precise, it is hard to write rules for distinguishing mass and count nouns which are particularly important in detecting these errors (Kawai et al., 1984). The major reason for this is that whether a noun is a mass noun or a count noun greatly depends on its meaning or its surrounding context (refer to Allan (1980) and Bond (2005) for details of the mass count distinction).","The above errors are very common among Japanese learners of English (Kawai et al., 1984; Izumi et al., 2003). This is perhaps because the Japanese language does not have a mass count distinction system similar to that of English. Thus, it is favorable for error detection systems aiming at Japanese learners to be capable of detecting these errors. In other words, such systems need to some-how distinguish mass and count nouns.","This paper proposes a method for distinguishing mass and count nouns in context to complement the conventional rules for detecting grammatical errors. In this method, rst, training data, which consist of instances of mass and count nouns, are automatically generated from a corpus. Then, decision lists for distinguishing mass and count nouns are learned from the training data. Finally, the decision lists are used with the conventional rules to detect the target errors.","The proposed method requires a corpus to learn decision lists for distinguishing mass and count nouns. General corpora such as newspaper articles can be used for the purpose. However, a drawback to it is that there are differences in character between general corpora and the writing of non-native learners of English (Granger, 1998; Chodorow and Leacock, 2000). For instance, Chodorow and Leacock (2000) point out that the word concentrate is usually used as a noun in a general corpus whereas it is a verb 91% of the time in essays written by non-native learners of English. Consequently, the differences affect the performance of the proposed method.","In order to reduce the drawback, the proposed method is augmented by feedback; it takes as feedback learners’ essays whose errors are corrected by a teacher of English (hereafter, referred to as the feedback corpus). In essence, the feedback corpus could be added to a general corpus to generate training data. Or, ideally training data could be generated only from the feedback corpus just as 241 from a general corpus. However, this causes a serious problem in practice since the size of the feedback corpus is normally far smaller than that of a general corpus. To make it practical, this paper discusses the problem and explores its solution.","The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the method for detecting the target errors based on the mass count distinction. Section 3 explains how the method is augmented by feedback. Section 4 discusses experiments conducted to evaluate the proposed method."]},{"title":"2 Method for detecting the target errors 2.1 Generating training data","paragraphs":["First, instances of the target noun that head their noun phrase (NP) are collected from a corpus with their surrounding words. This can be simply done by an existing chunker or parser.","Then, the collected instances are tagged with mass or count by the following tagging rules. For example, the underlined chicken: ... are a lot of chickens in the roost ... is tagged as ... are a lot of chickens/count in the roost ... because it is in plural form.","We have made tagging rules based on linguistic knowledge (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002). Figure 1 and Table 1 represent the tagging rules. Figure 1 shows the framework of the tagging rules. Each node in Figure 1 represents a question applied to the instance in question. For example, the root node reads Is the instance in question plural?. Each leaf represents a result of the classication. For example, if the answer is yes at the root node, the instance in question is tagged with count. Otherwise, the question at the lower node is applied and so on. The tagging rules do not classify instances as mass or count in some cases. These unclassied instances are tagged with the symbol ?. Unfortunately, they cannot readily be included in training data. For simplicity of implementation, they are excluded from training data1",".","Note that the tagging rules can be used only for generating training data. They cannot be used to distinguish mass and count nouns in the writing of learners of English for the purpose of detecting","1","According to experiments we have conducted, approximately 30% of instances are tagged with ? on average. It is highly possible that performance of the proposed method will improve if these instances are included in the training data. the target errors since they are based on the articles and the distinction between singular and plural.","Finally, the tagged instances are stored in a le with their surrounding words. Each line of it consists of one of the tagged instances and its surrounding words as in the above chicken example. 2.2 Learning Decision Lists In the proposed method, decision lists are used for distinguishing mass and count nouns. One of the reasons for the use of decision lists is that they have been shown to be effective to the word sense disambiguation task and the mass count distinction is highly related to word sense as we will see in this section. Another reason is that rules for distinguishing mass and count nouns are observable in decision lists, which helps understand and improve the proposed method.","A decision list consists of a set of rules. Each rule matches the template as follows:","If a condition is true, then a decision (1)","To dene the template in the proposed method, let us have a look at the following two examples: 1. I read the paper. 2. The paper is made of hemp pulp. The underlined papers in both sentences cannot simply be classied as mass or count by the tagging rules presented in Section 2.1 because both are singular and modied by the denite article. Nevertheless, we can tell that the former is a count noun and the latter is a mass noun from the contexts. This suggests that the mass count distinction is often determined by words surrounding the target noun. In example 1, we can tell that the paper refers to something that can be read such as a newspaper or a scientic paper from read, and therefore it is a count noun. Likewise, in example 2, we can tell that the paper refers to a certain substance from made and pulp, and therefore it is a mass noun.","Taking this observation into account, we dene the template based on words surrounding the target noun. To formalize the template, we will use a random variable ","that takes either","or","","to denote that the target noun is a mass noun","or a count noun, respectively. We will also use"," and","to denote a word and a certain context around the target noun, respectively. We dene 242                             yes yes yes yes no no no no         "," yes no COUNT modied by a little?"]},{"title":"?","paragraphs":["COUNT MASS"]},{"title":"?","paragraphs":["MASS plural?","modied by one of the words in Table 1(a)?","modied by one of the words in Table 1(b)?","modied by one of the words in Table 1(c)?

It consisted of 47 essays (3180 words) on the topic traveling. A native speaker of English who was a professional rewriter of English recognized 105 target errors in it.","The written part of the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 1995) was used to learn decision lists.

As a preprocessing, spelling errors were corrected using a spell checker. The results of the detection were compared to those done by the native-speaker of English. From the comparison, recall and precision were calculated.","Then, the feedback-augmented method was evaluated on the same target essays. Each target essay in turn was left out, and all the remaining target essays were used as a feedback corpus. The target errors in the left-out essay were detected using the feedback-augmented method. The results of all 47 detections were integrated into one to calculate overall performance. This way of feedback can be regarded as that one uses revised essays previously written in a class to detect errors in essays on the same topic written in other classes.","Finally, the above two methods were compared with their seven variants shown in Table 5. DL in Table 5 refers to the nine decision list based methods (the above two methods and their seven variants). The words in brackets denote the corpora used to learn decision lists; the symbol +FB means that the feedback corpus was simply added to the general corpus. The subscripts  and ","indicate that the feedback was done by using Equation (8) and Equation (9), respectively.","In addition to the seven variants, two kinds of earlier method were used for comparison. One was one (Kawai et al., 1984) of the rule-based methods. It judges singular head nouns with no determiner to be erroneous since missing articles are most common in the writing of Japanese learners of English. In the experiments, this was implemented by treating all nouns as count nouns and applying the same detection rules as in the proposed method to the countability.","The other was a web-based method (Lapata and Keller, 2005)12","for generating articles. It retrieves web counts for queries consisting of two words preceding the NP that the target noun head, one of the articles ( ","a/an, the,","), and the core NP to generate articles. All queries are performed as exact matches using quotation marks and submitted to the Google search engine in lower case. For example, in the case of *She is good student., it retrieves web counts for she is a good student,","12","There are other statistical methods that can be used for comparison including Lee (2004) and Minnen (2000). Lapata and Keller (2005) report that the web-based method is the best performing article generation method. 246 she is the good student, and she is good student. Then, it generates the article that maximizes the web counts. We extended it to make it capable of detecting our target errors. First, the singular/plural distinction was taken into account in the queries (e.g., she is a good students, she is the good students, and she is good students in addition to the above three queries). The one(s) that maximized the web counts was judged to be correct; the rest were judged to be erroneous. Second, if determiners other than the articles modify head nouns, only the distinction between singular and plural was taken into account (e.g., he has some book vs he has some books). In the case of much/many, the target noun in singular form modied by much and that in plural form modied by many were compared (e.g., he has much furniture vs he has many furnitures). Finally, some rules were used to detect literal errors. For example, plural head nouns modied by this were judged to be erroneous. 4.3 Experimental Results and Discussion Table 5 shows the experimental results. Rule-based and Web-based in Table 5 refer to the rule-based method and the web-based method, respectively. The other symbols are as already explained in Section 4.2.","As we can see from Table 5, all the decision list based methods outperform the earlier methods. The rule-based method treated all nouns as count nouns, and thus it did not work well at all on mass nouns. This caused a lot of false-positives and false-negatives. The web-based method suffered a lot from other errors than the target errors since Table 5: Experimental results Method Recall Precision DL (BNC) 0.66 0.65 DL (BNC+FB) 0.66 0.65 DL"," (BNC) 0.66 0.65","DL ","(BNC) 0.69 0.70 DL (EDR) 0.70 0.68 DL (EDR+FB) 0.71 0.69 DL"," (EDR) 0.71 0.70","DL ","(EDR) 0.71 0.72 DL (FB) 0.43 0.76 Rule-based 0.59 0.39 Web-based 0.49 0.53 it implicitly assumed that there were no errors except the target errors. Contrary to this assumption, not only did the target essays contain the target errors but also other errors since they were written by Japanese learners of English. This indicate that the queries often contained the other errors when web counts were retrieved. These errors made the web counts useless, and thus it did not perform well. By contrast, the decision list based methods did because they distinguished mass and count nouns by one of the words around the target noun that was most likely to be effective according to the log-likelihood ratio13","; the best performing decision list based method (DL","","(EDR)) is signicantly superior to the best performing14","non-decision list based method (Web-based) in both recall and precision at the 99% condence level.","Table 5 also shows that the feedback-augmented methods benet from feedback. Only an exception is DL","","(BNC). The reason is that the size of BNC is far larger than that of the feedback corpus and thus it did not affect the performance. This also explains that simply adding the feedback corpus to the general corpus achieved little or no improvement as DL (EDR+FB) and DL (BNC+FB) show. Unlike these, both DL"," (BNC) and DL","","(EDR) benet from feedback since the effect of the general corpus is limited to some extent by the log function in Equation (9). Because of this, both benet from feedback despite the differences in size between the feedback corpus and the general corpus.","Although the experimental results have shown that the feedback-augmented method is effective to detecting the target errors in the writing of Japanese learners of English, even the best performing method (DL","","(EDR)) made 30 false-negatives and 29 false-positives. About 70% of the false-negatives were errors that required other sources of information than the mass count distinction to be detected. For example, extra definite articles (e.g., *the traveling) cannot be detected even if the correct mass count distinction is given. Thus, only a little improvement is expected in recall however much feedback corpus data be-come available. On the other hand, most of the","13","Indeed, words around the target noun were effective.

From the results, we conclude that the feedback-augmented method is effective to detecting errors concerning the articles and singular plural usage in the writing of Japanese learners of English.","Although it is not taken into account in this paper, the feedback corpus contains further useful information. For example, we can obtain training data consisting of instances of errors by comparing the feedback corpus with its original corpus. Also, comparing it with the results of detection, we can know performance of each rule used in the detection, which make it possible to increase or decrease their log-likelihood ratios according to their performance. We will investigate how to exploit these sources of information in future work."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The authors would like to thank Sekine Satoshi who has developed the OAK System.
