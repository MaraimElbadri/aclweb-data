Through two experiments, three methods for constructing word vectors, i.e., LSA-based, cooccurrence-based and dictionary-based methods, were compared in terms of the ability to represent two kinds of similarity, i.e., taxonomic similarity and associative similarity. The result of the comparison was that the dictionary-based word vectors better reflect taxonomic similarity, while the LSA-based and the cooccurrence-based word vectors better reflect associative similarity."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Recently, geometric models have been used to represent words and their meanings, and proven to be highly useful both for many NLP applications associated with semantic processing (Widdows, 2004) and for human modeling in cognitive science (Gärdenfors, 2000; Landauer and Dumais, 1997). There are also good reasons for studying geometric models in the fieldof computational linguistics. First, geometric models are cost-effective in that it takes much less time and less effort to construct large-scale geometric representation of word meanings than it would take to construct dictionaries or thesauri. Second, they can represent the implicit knowledge of word meanings that dictionaries and thesauri cannot do. Finally, geometric representation is easy to revise and extend.","A vector space model is the most commonly used geometric model for the meanings of words. The basic idea of a vector space model is that words are represented by high-dimensional vectors, i.e., word vectors, and the degree of semantic similarity between any two words can be easily computed as a cosine of the angle formed by their vectors.","A number of methods have been proposed for constructing word vectors. Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is the most well-known method that uses the frequency of words in a fraction of documents to assess the coordinates of word vectors and singular value decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimension. LSA was originally put forward as a document indexing technique for automatic in-formation retrieval (Deerwester et al., 1990), but several studies (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) have shown that LSA successfully mimics many human behaviors associated with semantic processing. Other methods use a variety of other information: cooccurrence of two words (Burgess, 1998; Schütze, 1998), occurrence of a word in the sense definitions of a dictionary (Kasahara et al., 1997; Niwa and Nitta, 1994) or word association norms (Steyvers et al., 2004).","However, despite the fact that there are different kinds of similarity between words, or different relations underlying word similarity such as a synonymous relation and an associative relation, no studies have ever examined the relationship between methods for constructing word vectors and the type of similarity involved in word vectors in a systematic way. Some studies on word vectors have compared the performance among different methods on some specific tasks such as semantic disambiguation (Niwa and Nitta, 1994) and cued/free recall (Steyvers et al., 2004), but it is not at all clear whether there are essential differences in the quality of similarity among word vectors constructed by different methods, and if so, what kind of similarity is involved in what kind of word vectors. Even in the field of cognitive psychology, although geometric models of similarity such as multidimensional scaling have long been studied and debated (Nosofsky, 1992), the possibility that different methods for word vectors may cap-858 ture different kinds of word similarity has never been addressed.","This study, therefore, aims to examine the relationship between the methods for constructing word vectors and the type of similarity in a systematic way. Especially this study addresses three methods, LSA-based, cooccurrence-based, and dictionary-based methods, and two kinds of similarity, taxonomic similarity and associative similarity. Word vectors constructed by these methods are compared in the performance of two tasks, i.e., multiple-choice synonym test and word association, which measure the degree to which they reflect these two kinds of similarity."]},{"title":"2 Two Kinds of Similarity","paragraphs":["In this study, we divide word similarity into two categories: taxonomic similarity and associative similarity. Taxonomic similarity, or categorical similarity, is a kind of semantic similarity between words in the same level of categories or clusters of the thesaurus, in particular synonyms, antonyms, and other coordinates. Associative similarity, on the other hand, is a similarity between words that are associated with each other by virtue of semantic relations other than taxonomic one such as a collocational relation and a proximity relation. For example, the word writer and the word author are taxonomically similar because they are synonyms, while the word writer and the word book are associatively similar because they are associated by virtue of an agent-subject relation.","This dichotomy of similarity is practically important. Some tasks such as automatic thesaurus updating and paraphrasing need assessing taxonomic similarity, while some other tasks such as affective Web search and semantic disambiguation require assessing associative similarity rather than taxonomic similarity. This dichotomy is also psychologically motivated. Many empirical studies on word searches and speech disorders have revealed that words in the mind (i.e., mental lexicon) are organized by these two kinds of similarity (Aitchison, 2003). This dichotomy is also essential to some cognitive processes. For example, metaphors are perceived as being more apt when their constituent words are associatively more similar but categorically dissimilar (Utsumi et al., 1998). These psychological findingssuggest that people distinguish between these two kinds of similarity in certain cognitive processes."]},{"title":"3 Constructing Word Vectors 3.1 Overview","paragraphs":["In this study, word vectors (or word spaces) are constructed in the following way. First, all content words ti in a corpus are represented as m-dimensional feature vectors wi. wi = (wi1, wi2, · · · , wim) (1) Each element wij is determined by statistical analysis of the corpus, whose methods will be described in Section 3.3. A matrix M is then constructed using n feature vectors as rows. M = ( w 1 ... wn ) (2) Finally, the dimension of row vectors wi is reduced from m to k by means of a SVD technique. As a result, any words are represented as k-dimensional vectors. 3.2 Corpus In this study, we employ three kinds of Japanese corpora: newspaper articles, novels and a dictionary. As a newspaper corpus, we use 4 months’ worth of Mainichi newspaper articles published in 1999. They consist of 500,182 sentences in 251,287 paragraphs, and words vectors are constructed for 53,512 words that occur three times or more in these articles. Concerning a corpus of novels, we use a collection of 100 Japanese novels “Shin cho Bunko No 100 Satsu” consisting of 475,782 sentences and 230,392 paragraphs. Word vectors are constructed for 46,666 words that occur at least three times. As a Japanese dictionary, we use “Super Nihongo Daijiten” published by Gakken, from which 89,007 words are extracted for word vectors. 3.3 Methods for Computing Vector Elements LSA-based method (LSA)","In the LSA-based method, a vector element wij is assessed as a tf-idf score of a word ti in a piece sj of document. wij = tfij × ( log m dfi + 1 ) (3) In this formula, tfij denotes the number of times the word ti occurs in a piece of text sj, and dfi denotes the number of pieces in which the word ti occurs. As a unit of text piece sj, we consider 859 a sentence and a paragraph. Hence, for example, when a sentence is used as a unit, the dimension of feature vectors wi is equal to the number of sentences in a corpus. We also use two corpora, i.e., newspapers and novels, and thus we obtain four different word spaces by the LSA-based method. Cooccurrence-based method (COO)","In the cooccurrence-based method, a vector element wij is assessed as the number of times words ti and tj occur in the same piece of text, and thus M is an n × n symmetric matrix. As in the case of the LSA-based method, we use two units of text piece (i.e., a sentence or a paragraph) and two corpora (i.e., newspapers or novels), thus resulting in four different word spaces.","Note that this method is similar to Schütze’s (1998) method for constructing a semantic space in that both are based on the word cooccurrence, not on the word frequency. However they are different in that Schütze’s method uses the cooccurrence with frequent content words chosen as in-dicators of primitive meanings. Burgess’s (1998) “Hyper space Analogue to Language (HAL)” is also based on the word cooccurrence but does not use any technique of dimensionality reduction. Dictionary-based method (DIC)","In the dictionary-based method, a vector element wij is assessed by the following formula: wij =  fij + α √ ∑ k fikfkj + βfji  × log n dfj","(4) where fij denotes the number of times the word tj occurs in the sense definitions of the word ti, and dfj denotes the number of words whose sense definitions contain the word tj. The second term in parentheses in Equation (4) means the square root of the number of times the word tj occurs in a collection of sense definitions for any words that are included in the sense definitions of the word ti, while the third term means the number of times ti occurs in the sense definitions of tj. The parameters α and β are positive real constants express-ing the weights for these information. (Following Kasahara et al. (1997), these parameters are set to 0.2 in this paper.)","Equation (4) was originally put forward by Kasahara et al. (1997), but our dictionary-based method differs from their method in terms of how the dimensions are reduced. Their method groups together the dimensions for words in the same category of a thesaurus, but our method uses SVD as we will described next. 3.4 Reducing Dimensions Using a SVD technique, a matrix M is factorized as the product of three matrices U ΣV T",", where the diagonal matrix Σ consists of r singular values that are arranged in nonincreasing order such that r is the rank of M . When we use a k × k matrix Σk consisting of the largest k singular values, the matrix M is approximated by UkΣkV T","k , where the i-th row of Uk corresponds to a k-dimensional “redu ced word vector” for the word ti."]},{"title":"4 Experiment 1: Synonym Judgment 4.1 Method","paragraphs":["In order to compare different word vectors in terms of the ability to judge taxonomic similarity between words, we conducted a synonym judgment experiment using a standard multiple-choice synonym test. Each item of a synonym test consisted of a stem word and five alternative words from which the test-taker was asked to choose one with the most similar meaning to the stem word.","In the experiment, we used 32 items from the synonym portions of Synthetic Personality In-ventory (SPI) test, which has been widely used for employment selection in Japanese companies. These items were selected so that all the vector spaces could contain the stem word and at least four of the five alternative words. For comparison purpose, we also used 38 antonym test items chosen from the same SPI test. Furthermore, in order to obtain a more reliable, unbiased result, we automatically constructed 200 test items in such a way that we chose the stem word randomly, one correct alternative word randomly from words in the same deepest category of a Japanese thesaurus as the stem word, and other four alternatives from words in other categories. As a Japanese thesaurus, we used “Goi-Taikei” (Ikehara et al., 1999).","In the computer simulation, the computer’s choices were determined by computing cosine similarity between the stem word and each of the five alternative words using the vector spaces and choosing the word with the highest similarity. 4.2 Results and Discussion For each of the nine vector spaces, the synonym judgment simulation described above was con-860 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8","  "," "," "," ","",""," ","","",""]},{"title":"+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +                                        ","paragraphs":["LSA"]},{"title":"+ +","paragraphs":["COO","  ","DIC Number of Dimensions Correct Rate (a) SPI test items 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7"," "," "," ",""," ","","",""," ","",""," "]},{"title":"+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +                                       ","paragraphs":["Number of Dimensions Correct Rate (b) Computer-generated test items Figure 1: Correct rates of synonym tests ducted and the percentage of correct choices was calculated.

Concerning the LSA-based method (denoted by LSA) and the cooccurrence-based method (denoted by COO), Figure 1 plots the correct rates for the word vectors derived from the paragraphs of the newspaper corpus. (Such combination of corpus and text unit was optimal among all combinations, which will be justified later in this section.) The most important result shown in Figure 1 is that, regardless of the number of dimensions, the dictionary-based word vectors outperformed the other kinds of vectors on both SPI and computer-generated test items. This result thus suggests that the dictionary-based vector space reflec ts taxonomic similarity between words better than the LSA-based and the correlation-based spaces.","Another interesting finding is that there was no clear peak in the graphs of Figure 1.

Our finding of the absence of any obvious optimal dimensions is in a sharp contrast to Landauer and Dumais’s (1997) finding that the LSA word vectors with 300 dimensions achieved the maximum performance of 53% correct rate in a similar multiple-choice synonym test. Note that their maximum performance was a little better than that of our LSA vectors, but still worse than that of our dictionary-based vectors.","Figure 2 shows the performance of the LSA-based and the dictionary-based methods in antonym judgment, together with the result of synonym judgment. (Since the performance of the cooccurrence-based method did not differ from that of the LSA-based method, the correct rates of the cooccurrence-based method are not plotted in this figure.) The dictionary-based method also outperformed the LSA-based method in antonym judgment but their difference was much smaller than that of synonym judgment; at 200 or lower dimensions LSA-based method was better than the dictionary-based method. Interestingly, the dictionary-based word vectors yielded better performance in synonym judgment than in antonym judgment, while the LSA-based vectors showed better performance in antonym judgment. These contrasting results may be attributed to the difference of corpus characteristics. Dictionary’s definitions for antonymous words are likely to involve different words so that the differences between their meanings can be made clear. On the other hand, in newspaper articles (or literary texts), con-text words with which antonymous words occur are likely to overlap because their meanings are about the same domain.","Finally, we show the results of comparison among four combinations of corpora and text units for the LSA-based and the cooccurrence-based 861 Table 1: Comparison of mean correct rate among the combinations of two corpora and two text units","Newspaper Novel Method Para Sent Para Sent SPI test LSA 0.383 0.366 0.238 0.369 COO 0.413 0.369 0.255 0.280 Computer-generated test LSA 0.410 0.377 0.346 0.379 COO 0.375 0.363 0.311 0.310 Note.

This free-association database was developed based on the responses of 1,000 students to 210 stimulus words. For example, when given the word writer as a stimulus, students listed the words shown in Table 2. (Table 2 also shows the original words in Japanese.)","For the simulation experiment, we selected 176 stimulus words that all the three corpora contained. These stimuli had 27 associate words on average. We then removed any associate words that were synonymous with the stimulus word (e.g., author in Table 2), since the purpose of this experiment was to examine the ability to assess associative similarity between words. Whether or not each associate is synonymous with the stimulus was determined according to whether they be-long to the same deepest category of a Japanese thesaurus “Goi-Taikei” (Ikehara et al., 1999).","In the computer simulation, cosine similarity Table 2: Associates for the stimulus word writer Stimulus: writer ","Associates:","novel pen literary work painter","","","","","book author best-seller money","","","","write literature play art work"," ","","","popular human book paper pencil"," ","","","lucrative writing mystery music","",""," between the stimulus word and each of all the other words included in the vector space was computed, and all the words were sorted in descending order of similarity. The top i words were then chosen as associates.","The ability of word spaces to mimic human word association was evaluated on mean precision. Precision is the ratio of the number of human-produced associates chosen by computer to the number i of computer-chosen associates. A precision score was calculated every time a new human-produced associate was found in the top i words when i was incremented by 1, and after that mean precision was calculated as the average of all these precision scores. It must be noted here that, in order to eliminate the bias caused by the difference in the number of contained words among word spaces, we conducted the simulation using 46,000 words that we randomly chose for each corpus so that they could include all the human-produced associates.","Although this computational method of produc-ing associates is sufficient for the present purpose, it may be inadequate to model the psychological process of free association. Some empirical studies of word association (Nelson et al., 1998) revealed that frequent or familiar words were highly likely to be produced as associates, but our methods for constructing word vectors may not directly address such frequency effect on word association. Hence, we conducted an additional experiment in which only familiar words were used for computing similarity to a given stimulus word, i.e., less familiar words were not used as candidates of as-862 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 9001000 0 0.005 0.010 0.015 0.020 0.025 0.030                  ","","  ","","","","","","  ","","","","","","  ",""," · ·","···","···· ···","··","······  ",""," ","",""," ","  ","","  ",""," ",""]},{"title":"+ + + ++++++ ++++++++++ +                                         ","paragraphs":["LSA (Ave)","  ","LSA (Max)"]},{"title":"+ +","paragraphs":["COO (Ave) ··COO (Max)","  ","DIC Number of Dimensions Mean Precision Figure 3: Mean precision of word association judgment sociates.

The overall result was that the dictionary-based word vectors yielded the worst performance, as opposed to the result of synonym judgment.

Although the score of the dictionary-based vectors increased as the dimension of the vectors increased as in the case of synonym judgment, the scores of both LSA-based and cooccurrence-based vectors had a peak around 200 dimensions, as Landauer and Dumais (1997) demonstrated. This finding seems to suggest that some hundred dimensions may be enough to represent the knowledge of associative similarity.","Figure 4 shows the result of the additional experiment in which familiarity effects were taken into account. As compared to the result without familiarity filtering, there was a remarkable improvement of the performance of the dictionary-based method; the dictionary-based method outperformed the LSA-based method at 350 or higher dimensions and the cooccurrence-based method at 800 or higher dimensions. This may be because word occurrence in the sense definitions of a dictionary does not reflect the actual frequency or familiarity of words, and thus the dictionary-based method may possibly overestimate the similarity of infrequent or unfamiliar words. On the other hand, since the corpus of newspaper articles or novels is likely to reflect actual word frequency, the vector spaces derived from these corpora represent the similarity of infrequent words as appropriately as that of familiar words. 2","The result that the cooccurrence-based word 863 Table 3: Comparison of mean precision among the combinations of two corpora and two text units","Newspaper Novel Method Para Sent Para Sent All associates LSA 0.016 0.017 0.015 0.015 COO 0.023 0.018 0.012 0.008 Familiar associates LSA 0.0261 0.0258 0.024 0.023 COO 0.033 0.027 0.018 0.014 Note.

The listed values are mean precisions averaged over all the 20 numbers of dimensions. As in the case of synonym judgment experiment, word vectors constructed from newspaper paragraphs achieved the best performance, although only the LSA-based vectors had the highest precision when they were derived from sentences of newspaper articles. As in the case of synonym judgment, the newspaper corpus showed better performance than the novel corpus, and especially the cooccurrence-based method showed a fairly large difference in performance between two corpora.

They found that three kinds of semantic networks — WordNet, Roget’s thesaurus, and word associations — had a small-world structure and a scale-free pattern of connectivity, but semantic networks constructed from the LSA-based vector spaces did not have these properties. They interpreted this findingas indicating a limitation of the vector space model such as LSA to model human knowledge of word meanings.","However, we can interpret their findingin a different way by considering a possibility that different semantic networks may capture different kinds of word similarity. Scale-free networks have a common characteristic that a small number of nodes are connected to a very large number of other nodes (Barabási and Albert, 1999). In the semantic networks, such “hub ” nodes correspond to basic and highly polysemous words such as make and money, and these words are likely to be taxonomically similar to many other words. Hence if semantic networks reflect in large part taxonomic similarity between words, they are likely to have a scale-free structure. On the other hand, since it is less likely to assume that only a few words are associatively similar to a large number of other words, semantic networks reflecti ng associative similarity may not have a scale-free structure. Taken together, Steyvers and Tenenbaum’s (2005) finding can be reinterpreted as suggesting that WordNet and Roget’s thesaurus better reflect taxonomic similarity, while the LSA-based word vectors better reflect associative similarity, which is consistent with our finding."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Through two simulation experiments, we obtained the following findings:","• The dictionary-based word vectors better reflect the knowledge of taxonomic similarity, while the LSA-based and the cooccurrence-based word vectors better reflect the knowledge of associative similarity.

Vector negation (Widdows, 2003) may be a useful technique for this purpose. At the same time we are also interested in a method for combining different word spaces into one space, e.g., combining the dictionary-based and the LSA-based spaces into one coherent word space.
