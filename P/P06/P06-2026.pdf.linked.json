During translating or writing foreign language articles, people usually encounter terms, but they cannot obtain native translations after many lookup efforts. Some skilled users perhaps resort to a Web search engine, but a large amount of retrieved irrelevant pages and redundant information hamper them to acquire effective information. Thus, it is necessary to provide a system to automatically mine translation knowledge of terms using abundant Web information so as to help users accurately read or write foreign language articles.","The system of Web-based term translation mining has many applications. 1) Read-ing/writing assistant. 2) The construction tool of bilingual or multilingual dictionary for machine translation. The system can not only provide translation candidates for compiling a lexicon, but also rescore the candidate list of the dictionary. We can also use English as a medium language to build a lexicon translation bridge between two languages with few bilingual annotations (e.g., Japanese and Chinese). 3) Provide the translations of unknown queries in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). 4) As one of the typical application paradigms of the combination of CLIR and Web mining.","Automatic acquisition of bilingual translations has been extensively researched in the literature. The methods of acquiring translations are usually summarized as the following six categories. 1) Acquiring translations from parallel corpora. To reduce the workload of manual annotations, researchers have proposed different methods to automatically collect parallel corpora of different language versions from the Web (Kilgarriff, 2003). 2) Acquiring translations from nonparallel corpora (Fung, 1997; Rapp, 1999). It is based on the clue that the context of source term is very similar to that of target translation in a large amount of corpora. 3) Acquiring translations from a combination of translations of constituent words (Li et al., 2003). 4) Acquiring translations using cognate matching (Gey, 2004) 199 or transliteration (Seo et al., 2004). This method is very suitable for the translation between two languages with some intrinsic relationships, e.g., acquiring translations from Japanese to Chinese or from Korean to English. 5) Acquiring translations using anchor text information (Lu et al., 2004). 6) Acquiring translations from the Web. When people use Asia language (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) to write, they often annotate associated English meanings after terms. With the development of Web and the open of accessible electronic documents, digital library, and scientific articles, these resources will become more and more abundant. Thus, acquiring term translations from the Web is a feasible and effective way. Nagata et al. (2001) proposed an empirical function of the byte distance between Japanese and English terms as an evaluation criterion to extract translations of Japanese words, and the results could be used as a Japanese-English dictionary.","Cheng et al. (2004) utilized the Web as the corpus source to translate English unknown queries for CLIR. They proposed context-vector and chi-square methods to determine Chinese translations for unknown query terms via mining of top 100 search-result pages from Web search engines.","Zhang and Vines (2004) proposed using a Web search engine to obtain translations of Chinese out-of-vocabulary terms from the Web to improve CLIR performance. The method used Chinese as query items, and retrieved previous 100 document snippets by Google, and then estimated possible translations using co-occurrence information.","From the review above, we know that previous related researches didn’t concern the issue how to obtain effective Web pages with bilingual annotations, and they mainly utilized the frequency feature as the clue to mine the translation. In fact, previous 100 Web results seldom contain effective English equivalents. Apart from the frequency information, there are some other features such as distribution, length ratio, distance, keywords, key symbols and boundary information which have very important impacts on term translation mining. In this paper, the approach based on semantic prediction is proposed to obtain effective Web pages; for acquiring a correct translation list, the evaluation strategy in the weighted sum of multi-features is employed to rank the candidates.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give an overview of the system. Section 3 proposes effective Web page collection. In Section 4, we introduce translation candidate construction and noise solution. Section 5 presents candidate evaluation based on multi-features. Section 6 shows experimental results. The conclusion is drawn in the last sec-tion."]},{"title":"2 System Overview","paragraphs":["The C-E term translation mining system based on semantic prediction is illustrated in Figure 1.             ","Figure 1. The Chinese-English term translation mining system based on semantic prediction","","The system consists of two parts: Web page handling and term translation mining. Web page handling includes effective Web page collection and HTML analysis. The function of effective Web page collection is to collect these Web pages with bilingual annotations using semantic prediction, and then these pages are inputted into HTML analysis module, where possible features and text information are extracted. Term translation mining includes candidate unit construction, candidate noise solution, and rank&sort candidates. Translation candidates are formed through candidate unit construction module, and then we analyze their noises and propose the corresponding methods to handle them. At last, the approach using multi-features is employed to rank these candidates.","Correctly exploring all kinds of bilingual annotation forms on the Web can make a mining system extract comprehensive translation results. After analyzing a large amount of Web page examples, translation distribution forms is summarized as six categories in Figure 2: 1) Direct annotation (a). some have nothing (a1), and some have symbol marks (a2, a3) between the pair; 2) Separate annotation.

However, in a general Web search engine, when you input a Chinese technical term, the number of retrieved relevant Web pages is very large. It is infeasible to download all the Web pages because of a huge time-consuming process. If only the 100 abstracts of Web pages are used for the translation estima-tion just as in the previous work, effective English equivalent words are seldom contained for most Chinese terms in our experiments, for example: “三国演义, 三好学生, 百慕大三角, 车牌 号”. In this paper, a feasible method based on semantic prediction is proposed to automatically acquire effective Web pages. In the proposed method, possible English meanings of every constituent unit of a Chinese term are predicted and further expanded by using semantically relevant knowledge, and these expansion units with the original query are inputted to search bilingual Web pages. In the retrieved top-20 Web pages, feedback learning is employed to extract more semantically-relevant terms by frequency and average length. The refined expansion terms, together with the original query, are once more sent to retrieve effective relevant Web pages. 3.1 Term expansion Term expansion is to use predictive semantically-relevant terms of target language as the expansion of queries, and therefore resolve the issue that top retrieved Web pages seldom contain effective English annotations. Our idea is based on the assumption that the meanings of Chinese technical terms aren’t exactly known just through their constituent characters and words, but the closely related semantics and vocabulary information may be inferred and predicted. For example, the corresponding unit translations of a term “三国演义” are respectively: three(三), country, nation(国), act, practice(演), and meaning, justice(义). As seen from these English translations, we have a general impression of “things about three countries”. After expanding, the query item for the example above becomes \"三国演义\"+ (three | country | nation | act | practice | meaning | justice). The whole procedure consists of three steps: unit segmentation, item translation knowledge base construction, and expansion knowledge base evaluation.","Unit segmentation. Getting the constituent units of a technical term is a segmentation procedure. Because most Chinese terms consist of out-of-vocabulary words or meaningless characters, the performance using general word segmentation programs is not very desirable. In this paper, a segmentation method is employed to handle term segmentation so that possible meaningful constituent units are found. In the inner structure of proper nouns or terms, the rightmost unit usually contains a headword to reflect the major meaning of the term. Sometimes, the modifier starts from the leftmost point of a term to form a multi-character unit. As a result, forward maximum matching and backward maximum matching are respectively conducted on the term, and all the overlapped segmented units are added to candidate items. For example, for the term “abcd”, forward segmented units are “ab cd”, backward are “a bcd”, so “ab cd a bcd” will be viewed as our segmented items.","Item translation knowledge base construction. Because the segmented units of a technical term or proper name often consist of abbreviation items with shorter length, limited translations provided by general dictionaries often cannot satisfy the demand of translation prediction. Here, a semantic expansion based method is proposed to construct item translation knowledge base. In this method, we only keep these nouns or adjec-tive items consisting of 1-3 characters in the dictionary. If an item length is greater than two characters and contains any item in the knowledge base, its translation will be added as translation candidates of this item. For example, the Chinese term “流通股” can be segmented into the units “流通” and “股”, where “股” has only two English meanings “section, thigh” in the dictionary. However, we can derive its meaning us- (a1) (a2) (a3) (b1) (b2) (b3) (c) (d) (e) (f) 201 ing the longer word including this item such as “股东, 股票”. Thus, their respective translations “stock, stockholder” are added into the knowledge base list of “股” (see Figure 3).       Figure 3. An expansion example in the dictionary","knowledge base","Expansion knowledge base evaluation. To avoid over-expanding of translations for one item, using the retrieved number from the Web as our scoring criterion is employed to remove irrelevant expansion items and rank those possible candidates. For example, “股” and its expansion translation “stock” are combined as a new query “股 stock –股票”. It is sent to a general search engine like Google to obtain the count number, where only the co-occurrence of “ 股 ” and “stock” excluding the word “股票” is counted. The retrieved number is about 316000. If the occurrence number of an item is lower than a certain threshold (100), the evaluated translation will not be added to the item in the knowledge base. Those expanded candidates for the item in the dictionary are sorted through their retrieved number. 3.2 Feedback learning Though pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) has been successfully used in the information retrieval (IR), whether PRF in single-language IR or pre-translation PRF and post-translation PRF in CLIR, the feedback results are from source language to source language or target language to target language, that is, the language of feedback units is same as the retrieval language. Our novel is that the input language (Chinese) is different from the feedback target language (English), that is, realizing the feedback from source language to target language, and this feedback technique is also first applied to the term mining field.","After the expansion of semantic prediction, the predicted meaning of an item has some devia-tions with its actual sense, so the retrieved documents are perhaps not our expected results. In this paper, a PRF technique is employed to acquire more accurate, semantically relevant terms. At first, we collect top-20 documents from search results after term expansion, and then select target language units from these documents, get language units from these documents, which are highly related with the original query in source language. However, how to effectively select these units is a challenging issue. In the literature, researchers have proposed different methods such as Rocchio’s method or Robertson’s probabilistic method to solve this problem. After some experimental comparisons, a simple evaluation method using term frequency and average length is presented in this paper. The evaluation method is defined as follows: 1)( 1 )()( +∆ += ttftw , where N tsD t","N","i i∑","=∆ =1 ),(",")( (1)","Δ(t) represents the average length between the source word s and the target candidate t. If the greater that the average length is, the relevance degree between source terms and candidates will become lower. The purpose of adding Δ(t) to 1 is to avoid the divide overflow in the case that the average length is equal to zero. Di(s,t) denotes the byte distance between source words and target candidates, and N represents the total number of candidate occurrences in the estimated Web pages. This evaluation method is very suitable for the discrimination of these words with lower, but same term frequencies. In the ranked candidates after PRF feedback, top-5 candidates are selected as our refined expansion items. In the previous example, the refined expansion items are: Kingdoms, Three, Romance, Chinese, Traditional. These refined expansion terms, together with the original query, \"三国演义\"+(Kingdoms | Three | Romance | Chinese | Traditional) are once more sent to retrieve relevant results, which are viewed as effective Web pages used in the process of the following estimation."]},{"title":"4 Translation candidate construction and noise solution","paragraphs":["The goal of translation candidate construction is to construct and mine all kinds of possible translation forms of terms from the Web, and effectively estimate their feature information such as frequency and distribution. In the transferred text, we locate the position of a query keyword, and then obtain a 100-byte window with keyword as the center. In this window, each English word is built as a beginning index, and then string candidates are constructed with the increase of string in the form of one English word unit. String candidates are indexed in the database with hash and binary search method. If there exists the same item as the inputted candidate, its frequency is increased by 1, otherwise, this candidate is added 股股股股 股股股股票 股股股股东 202 to this position of the database. After handling one Web page, the distribution information is also estimated at the same time. In the programming implementation, the table of stop words and some heuristic rules of the beginning and end with respect to the keyword position are employed to accelerate the statistics process.","The aim of noise solution is to remove these irrelevant items and redundant information formed in the process of mining. These noises are defined as the following two categories.","1) Subset redundancy. The characteristic is that this item is a subset of one item, but its frequency is lower than that item. For example, “车 牌号:License plate number (6), License plate (5)”, where the candidate “License plate” belongs to subset redundancy. They should be removed.","2) Affix redundancy. The characteristic is that this item is the prefix or suffix of one item, but its frequency is greater than that item. For example, 1. “三国演义: Three Kingdoms (30), Romance of the Three Kingdoms (22), The Romance of Three Kingdoms (7)”, 2. “蓝筹股: Blue Chip (35), Blue Chip Economic Indicators (10)”. In Example 1, the item “Three Kingdoms” is suffix redundancy and should be removed. In Example 2, the term “Blue Chip” is in accord with the definition of prefix redundancy information, but this term is a correct translation candidate. Thus, the problem of affix redundancy information is so complex that we need an evaluation method to decide to retain or drop the candidate.","To deal with subset redundancy and affix redundancy information, sort-based subset deletion and mutual information methods are respectively proposed. More details refer to our previous paper (Fang et al., 2005)."]},{"title":"5 Candidate evaluation based on multi-features 5.1 Possible features for translation pairs","paragraphs":["Through analyzing mass Web pages, we obtain the following possible features that have important influences on term translation mining. They include: 1) candidate frequency and its distribution in different Web pages, 2) length ratio between source terms and target candidates (S-T), 3) distance between S-T, and 4) keywords, key symbols and boundary information between S-T. 1) Candidate frequency and its distribution","Translation candidate frequency is the most important feature and is the basis of decisionmaking. Only the terms whose frequencies are greater than a certain threshold are further considered as candidates in our system. Distribution feature reflects the occurrence information of one candidate in different Webs. If the distribution is very uniform, this candidate will more possibly become as the translation equivalent with a greater weight. This is also in accord with our intuition. For example, the translation candidates of the term “认股期权” include “put option” and “short put”, and their frequencies are both 5. However, their distributions are “1, 1, 1, 1, 1” and “2, 2, 1”. The distribution of “put option” is more uniform, so it will become as a translation candidate of “认股期权” with a greater weight. 2) Length ratio between S-T","The length ratio between S-T should satisfy certain constraints. Only the word number of a candidate falls within a certain range, the possibility of becoming a translation is great.","To estimate the length ratio relation between S-T, we conduct the statistics on the database with 5800 term translation pairs. For example, when Chinese term has three characters, i.e. W=3, the probability of English translations with two words is largest, about P(E=2 |W =3)= 78%, and there is nearly no occurrence out of the range of 1-4. Thus, different weights can be impacted on different candidates by using statistical distribution information of length ratio. The weight contributing to the evaluation function is set according to these estimated probabilities in the experiments. 3) Distance between S-T","Intuitively, if the distance between S-T is longer, the probability of being a translation pair will become smaller. Using this knowledge we can alleviate the effect of some noises through impacting different weights when we collect possible correct candidates far from the source term.","To estimate the distance between S-T, experiments are carried on 5800*200 pages with 5800 term pairs, and statistical results are depicted as the histogram of distances in Figure 4. 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 -100 -75 -50 -25 0 25 50 75 100  Figure 4. The histogram of distances between S-T 203 ","In the figure, negative value represents that English translation located in front of the Chinese term, and positive value represents English translation is behind the Chinese term. As shown from the figure, we know that most candidates are distributed in the range of -60-60 bytes, and few occurrences are out of this range. The numbers of translations appearing in front of the term and after the term are nearly equal. The curve looks like Gaussian probability distribution, so Gaussian models are proposed to model it. By the curve fitting, the parameters of Gaussian models are obtained, i.e. u=1 and sigma=2. Thus, the contribution probability of distance to the ranking function is formulized as","8/)1),(( 2 22","1 ),( −− = jiD","D ejip","π , where D(i,j) represents the byte distance between the source term i and the candidate j. 4) Keywords, key symbols and boundary information between S-T","Some Chinese keywords or capital English abbreviation letters between S-T can provide an important clue for the acquisition of possible correct translations. These Chinese keywords include the words such as “中文叫, 中文译为, 中文名称, 中文名称为, 中文称为, 或称为, 又称为, 英文叫, 英文名为, 英文称为, 英 文全称”. The punctuations between S-T can also provide very strong constraints, for example, when the marks “( )( ) [ ]” exist, the probability of being a translation pair will greatly increase. Thus, correctly judging these cases can not only make translation finding results more comprehensive, but also increase the possibility that this candidate is as one of correct translations. Boundary information refers to the fact that the context of candidates on the Web has distinct mark information, for example, the position of transition from continuous Chinese to English, the place with bracket ellipsis and independent units in the HTML text. 5.2 Candidate evaluation method After translation noise handling, we evaluate candidate translations so that possible candidates get higher scores. The method in the weighted sum of multi-features including: candidate frequency, distribution, length ratio, distance, keywords, key symbols and boundary information between S-T, is proposed to rank the candidates. The evaluation method is formulized as follows: ∑∑ ++= = N i j DL wjijiptsptScore 1 1 )),(),(([),()( δλ",")]),(),((max2 wjijipD j δλ + , 121 =+ λλ (2)","In the equation, Score(t) is proportional to","),( tspL , N and ),( jipD . If the bigger these component values are, the more they contribute to the whole evaluation formula, and correspondingly the candidate has higher score. The length ratio relation ),( tspL reflects the proportion relation between S-T as a whole, so its weight will be impacted on the Score(t) in the macro-view. The weights are trained through a large amount of technical terms and proper nouns, where each relation corresponds to one probability. N denotes the total number of Web pages that contain candidates, and partly reflects the distribution information of candidates in different Web pages. If the greater N is, the greater Score(t) will become. The distance relation ),( jipD is defined as the distance contribution probability of the jth source-candidate pair on the ith Web pages, which is impacted on every word pair emerged on the Web in the point of micro-view. Its calcu-lation formula is defined in Section 5.1. The weights of 1λ and 2λ represent the proportion of term frequency and term distribution, and 1λ denotes the weight of the total number of one candidate occurrences, and 2λ represents the weight of counting the nearest distance occurrence for each Web page. wji ),(δ is the contribution probability of keywords, key symbols and boundary information.

In the test set of 400 terms, there are more than one English translation for every Chinese term, and only one English translation for 3511 term pairs. In the test sets, Chinese terms are inputted to our system on batch, and their corresponding translations are viewed as a criterion to evaluate these mined candidates.
