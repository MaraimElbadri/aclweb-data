Among the various approaches to WSD, corpus-based supervised machine learning methods have been the most successful to date. With this approach, one would need to obtain a corpus in which each ambiguous word has been manually annotated with the correct sense, to serve as training data.","However, supervised WSD systems faced an important issue of domain dependence when using such a corpus-based approach. To investigate this, Escudero et al. (2000) conducted experiments using the DSO corpus, which contains sentences drawn from two different corpora, namely Brown Corpus (BC) and Wall Street Journal (WSJ). They found that training a WSD system on one part (BC or WSJ) of the DSO corpus and applying it to the other part can result in an accuracy drop of 12% to 19%. One reason for this is the difference in sense priors (i.e., the proportions of the different senses of a word) between BC and WSJ. For instance, the noun interest has these 6 senses in the DSO corpus: sense 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8. In the BC part of the DSO corpus, these senses occur with the proportions: 34%, 9%, 16%, 14%, 12%, and 15%. However, in the WSJ part of the DSO corpus, the proportions are different: 13%, 4%, 3%, 56%, 22%, and 2%. When the authors assumed they knew the sense priors of each word in BC and WSJ, and adjusted these two datasets such that the proportions of the different senses of each word were the same between BC and WSJ, accuracy improved by 9%. In another work, Agirre and Martinez (2004) trained a WSD system on data which was automatically gathered from the Internet. The authors reported a 14% improvement in accuracy if they have an accurate estimate of the sense priors in the evaluation data and sampled their training data according to these sense priors. The work of these researchers showed that when the domain of the training data differs from the domain of the data on which the system is applied, there will be a decrease in WSD accuracy.","To build WSD systems that are portable across different domains, estimation of the sense priors (i.e., determining the proportions of the different senses of a word) occurring in a text corpus drawn from a domain is important. McCarthy et al. (2004) provided a partial solution by describing a method to predict the predominant sense, or the most frequent sense, of a word in a corpus. Using the noun interest as an example, their method will try to predict that sense 1 is the predominant sense in the BC part of the DSO corpus, while sense 4 is the predominant sense in the WSJ part of the 89 corpus.","In our recent work (Chan and Ng, 2005b), we directly addressed the problem by applying machine learning methods to automatically estimate the sense priors in the target domain. For instance, given the noun interest and the WSJ part of the DSO corpus, we attempt to estimate the proportion of each sense of interest occurring in WSJ and showed that these estimates help to improve WSD accuracy. In our work, we used naive Bayes as the training algorithm to provide posterior probabilities, or class membership estimates, for the instances in the target domain. These probabilities were then used by the machine learning methods to estimate the sense priors of each word in the target domain.","However, it is known that the posterior probabilities assigned by naive Bayes are not reliable, or not well calibrated (Domingos and Pazzani, 1996). These probabilities are typically too extreme, often being very near 0 or 1. Since these probabilities are used in estimating the sense priors, it is important that they are well calibrated.","In this paper, we explore the estimation of sense priors by first calibrating the probabilities from naive Bayes. We also propose using probabilities from another algorithm (logistic regression, which already gives well calibrated probabilities) to estimate the sense priors. We show that by using well calibrated probabilities, we can estimate the sense priors more effectively. Using these estimates improves WSD accuracy and we achieve results that are significantly better than using our earlier approach described in (Chan and Ng, 2005b).","In the following section, we describe the algorithm to estimate the sense priors. Then, we describe the notion of being well calibrated and discuss why using well calibrated probabilities helps in estimating the sense priors. Next, we describe an algorithm to calibrate the probability estimates from naive Bayes. Then, we discuss the corpora and the set of words we use for our experiments before presenting our experimental results. Next, we propose using the well calibrated probabilities of logistic regression to estimate the sense priors, and perform significancetests to compare our various results before concluding."]},{"title":"2 Estimation of Priors","paragraphs":["To estimate the sense priors, or a priori probabilities of the different senses in a new dataset, we used a confusion matrix algorithm (Vucetic and Obradovic, 2001) and an EM based algorithm (Saerens et al., 2002) in (Chan and Ng, 2005b). Our results in (Chan and Ng, 2005b) indicate that the EM based algorithm is effective in estimating the sense priors and achieves greater improvements in WSD accuracy compared to the confusion matrix algorithm. Hence, to estimate the sense priors in our current work, we use the EM based algorithm, which we describe in this section. 2.1 EM Based Algorithm","Most of this section is based on (Saerens et al.,","2002).

However, it is known that the posterior probabilities assigned by naive Bayes are not well calibrated (Domingos and Pazzani, 1996).","It is important to use an algorithm which gives well calibrated probabilities, if we are to use the probabilities in estimating the sense priors. In this section, we will first describe the notion of being well calibrated before discussing why having well calibrated probabilities helps in estimating the sense priors. Finally, we will introduce a method used to calibrate the probabilities from naive Bayes. 3.1 Well Calibrated Probabilities Assume for each instance  , a classifier outputs a probability S    between 0 and 1, of  belonging to class  ",". The classifier is well-calibrated if the empirical class membership probability  ","","S     converges to the probability value S","    ","as the number of examples classified goes to infinity (Zadrozny and Elkan, 2002).

Hence, using an algorithm which gives well calibrated probabilities helps in the estimation of sense priors. 3.3 Isotonic Regression Zadrozny and Elkan (2002) successfully used a method based on isotonic regression (Robertson et al., 1988) to calibrate the probability estimates from naive Bayes. To compute the isotonic regression, they used the pair-adjacent violators (PAV) (Ayer et al., 1955) algorithm, which we show in Figure 1. Briefly , what PAV does is to initially view each data value as a level set. While there are two adjacent sets that are out of order (i.e., the left level set is above the right one) then the sets are combined and the mean of the data values be-comes the value of the new level set.","PAV works on binary class problems.

For reducing a multiclass problem into a set of binary class problems, experiments in (Zadrozny and Elkan, 2002) suggest that the one-against-all approach works well. In one-against-all, a separate classifieris trained for each class   , where examples belonging to class  ","are treated as positive examples and all other examples are treated as negative examples. A separate classifier is then learnt for each binary class problem and the probability estimates from each classifierare calibrated. Finally, the calibrated binary-class probability estimates are combined to obtain multiclass probabilities, computed by a simple normalization of the calibrated estimates from each binary classifier, as suggested by Zadrozny and Elkan (2002)."]},{"title":"4 Selection of Dataset","paragraphs":["In this section, we discuss the motivations in choosing the particular corpora and the set of words used in our experiments. 4.1 DSO Corpus The DSO corpus (Ng and Lee, 1996) contains 192,800 annotated examples for 121 nouns and 70 verbs, drawn from BC and WSJ. BC was built as a balanced corpus and contains texts in various categories such as religion, fiction,etc. In contrast, the focus of the WSJ corpus is on financial and business news. Escudero et al. (2000) exploited the difference in coverage between these two corpora to separate the DSO corpus into its BC and WSJ parts for investigating the domain dependence of several WSD algorithms. Following their setup, we also use the DSO corpus in our experiments.","The widely used SEMCOR (SC) corpus (Miller et al., 1994) is one of the few currently available manually sense-annotated corpora for WSD. SEMCOR is a subset of BC. Since BC is a balanced corpus, and training a classifieron a general corpus before applying it to a more specificcorpus is a natural scenario, we will use examples from BC as training data, and examples from WSJ as evaluation data, or the target dataset. 4.2 Parallel Texts Scalability is a problem faced by current supervised WSD systems, as they usually rely on manually annotated data for training. To tackle this problem, in one of our recent work (Ng et al., 2003), we had gathered training data from parallel texts and obtained encouraging results in our 92 evaluation on the nouns of SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample task (Kilgarriff, 2001). In another recent evaluation on the nouns of SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task (Chan and Ng, 2005a), promising results were also achieved using examples gathered from parallel texts. Due to the potential of parallel texts in addressing the issue of scalability, we also drew training data for our earlier sense priors estimation experiments (Chan and Ng, 2005b) from parallel texts. In addition, our parallel texts training data represents a natural domain difference with the test data of SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample task, of which 91% is drawn from the British National Corpus (BNC).","As part of our experiments, we followed the experimental setup of our earlier work (Chan and Ng, 2005b), using the same 6 English-Chinese parallel corpora (Hong Kong Hansards, Hong Kong News, Hong Kong Laws, Sinorama, Xinhua News, and English translation of Chinese Treebank), available from Linguistic Data Consortium. To gather training examples from these parallel texts, we used the approach we described in (Ng et al., 2003) and (Chan and Ng, 2005b). We then evaluated our estimation of sense priors on the nouns of SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample task, similar to the evaluation we conducted in (Chan and Ng, 2005b). Since the test data for the nouns of SENSEVAL-3 English lexical sample task (Mihalcea et al., 2004) were also drawn from BNC and represented a difference in domain from the parallel texts we used, we also expanded our evaluation to these SENSEVAL-3 nouns. 4.3 Choice of Words Research by (McCarthy et al., 2004) highlighted that the sense priors of a word in a corpus depend on the domain from which the corpus is drawn. A change of predominant sense is often indicative of a change in domain, as different corpora drawn from different domains usually give different predominant senses. For example, the predominant sense of the noun interest in the BC part of the DSO corpus has the meaning “a sense of concern with and curiosity about someone or something”. In the WSJ part of the DSO corpus, the noun interest has a different predominant sense with the meaning “a fixed charge for borrowing money”, reflecting the business and finance focus of the WSJ corpus.","Estimation of sense priors is important when there is a significant change in sense priors between the training and target dataset, such as when there is a change in domain between the datasets. Hence, in our experiments involving the DSO corpus, we focused on the set of nouns and verbs which had different predominant senses between the BC and WSJ parts of the corpus. This gave us a set of 37 nouns and 28 verbs. For experiments involving the nouns of SENSEVAL-2 and SENSEVAL-3 English lexical sample task, we used the approach we described in (Chan and Ng, 2005b) of sampling training examples from the parallel texts using the natural (empirical) distribution of examples in the parallel texts. Then, we focused on the set of nouns having different predominant senses between the examples gathered from parallel texts and the evaluation data for the two SENSEVAL tasks. This gave a set of 6 nouns for SENSEVAL-2 and 9 nouns for SENSEVAL-3. For each noun, we gathered a maximum of 500 parallel text examples as training data, similar to what we had done in (Chan and Ng, 2005b)."]},{"title":"5 Experimental Results","paragraphs":["Similar to our previous work (Chan and Ng, 2005b), we used the supervised WSD approach described in (Lee and Ng, 2002) for our experiments, using the naive Bayes algorithm as our classifier.

However, using a learning algorithm which already gives well calibrated posterior probabilities may be more effective in estimating the sense priors. One possible algorithm is logistic regression, which directly optimizes for getting approximations of the posterior probabilities. Hence, its probability estimates are already well calibrated (Zhang and Yang, 2004; Niculescu-Mizil and Caruana, 2005).","In the rest of this section, we first conduct experiments to estimate sense priors using the predictions of logistic regression.

However, the WSD accuracies of these unadjusted logistic regression classifiers are on average about 4% lower than those of the unadjusted naive Bayes classifiers. One possible reason is that being a discriminative learner, logistic regression requires more training examples for its performance to catch up to, and possibly overtake the generative naive Bayes learner (Ng and Jordan, 2001).","Although the accuracy of logistic regression as a basic classifieris lower than that of naive Bayes, its predictions may still be suitable for estimating","1","Though not shown, we also calculated the accuracies of these binary classifierswithout calibration, and found them to be similar to the accuracies of the multiclass naive Bayes shown in the column L under NB in Table 1. 94","Method comparison DSO nouns DSO verbs SE2 nouns SE3 nouns","NB-EM    vs. NB-EM","","","","","NBcal-EM","  ","vs. NB-EM","   ","NBcal-EM","","  vs. NB-EM","","","    ","NBcal-EM    vs. NB-EM","","","","","NBcal-EM   ","vs. NB-EM   ","","  ","NBcal-EM   ","vs. NBcal-EM  "," ","  Table 4: Paired t-tests between the various methods for the 4 datasets. sense priors.
